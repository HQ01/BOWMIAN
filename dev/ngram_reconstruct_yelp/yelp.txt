0 My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.
1 The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.
2 Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.
3 It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.
4 Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.
5 It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.
6 I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.
7 It was amazing.
8 While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.
9 It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.
10 It was the best "toast" I've ever had.
11 Anyway, I can't wait to go back!
12 I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place.
13 It goes to show you, you can please everyone.
14 They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.
15 In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday.
16 It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else.
17 We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders.
18 Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server.
19 The prices were very good as well.
20 We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02.
21 We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small "Here's The Beef" pizza so we can both try them.
22 The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11" pizza.
23 Both were awesome!
24 My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better.
25 The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!
26 We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42.
27 So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers.
28 That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.
29 Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!!
30 It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.
31 The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept.
32 does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.
33 You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.
34 The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!
35 General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!!
36 Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and I'd be surprised if you don't walk out totally satisfied as I just did.
37 Like I always say..... "Mistakes are inevitable, it's how we recover from them that is important"!!
38 !
39 Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff.
40 You've got a customer for life!!
41 .......... :^)
42 Drop what you're doing and drive here.
43 After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.
44 The food is that good.
45 This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.
46 While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the "Grand Opening" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!
47 A new place to try!
48 It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.
49 I ordered dinner for two, to go.
50 The menu was awesome.
51 I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.
52 It made it difficult to choose something.
53 Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.
54 They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.
55 So much flavor.
56 I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.
57 The salsa bar is endless.
58 I really stocked up.
59 I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers.
60 The horchata is handmade and delicious.
61 They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!
62 As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!
63 I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.
64 There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.
65 All the paintings are great, love the artist.
66 Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu.
67 Carefully crafted features with much to drink.
68 Start with the pork belly buns and a stout.
69 Then go on until you can no longer.
70 The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.
71 Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.
72 Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.
73 The flavor permutations are basically endless.
74 I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.
75 It was marvelous.
76 Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe.
77 Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices.
78 They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around.
79 Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
80 They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.
81 Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.
82 I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.
83 The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.
84 okay this is the best place EVER!
85 i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville.
86 i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all.
87 the have all the good stuff.
88 from cheese down to wine.
89 i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona.
90 now if we could just get dean and deluca!
91 This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)
92 first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!
93 The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!
94 We will be going back ALOT!
95 U can go there n check the car out.
96 If u wanna buy 1 there?
97 That's wrong move!
98 If u even want a car service from there?
99 U made a biggest mistake of ur life!!
100 I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service, guess what?
101 They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now.
102 If without fixing the problem.
103 Might bring some serious accident.
104 Then she did what they said.
105 4 brand new tires, timing belt, 4 new brake pads.
106 U know why's the worst?
107 All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!!
108 What a trashy dealer is that?
109 People, better off go somewhere!
110 I love this place!
111 I have been coming here for ages.
112 My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich.
113 The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!
114 I love love LOVE this place.
115 My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place.
116 I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers!
117 The food here is so good!
118 We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters.
119 We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees.
120 So also ordered the Kale-aid.
121 All of the dishes were yummy.
122 I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed!
123 I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad.
124 I always have to get the Kale aid.
125 Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date!
126 Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes!
127 I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness!
128 I don't think I can live without True Food!
129 Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants.
130 I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.
131 That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day.
132 I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway.
133 I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit.
134 The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread.
135 The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions.
136 All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese.
137 Really, really delicious.
138 I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small.
139 This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.
140 Disgusting!
141 Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.
142 Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.
143 The food itself was pretty bad.
144 We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!
145 After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
146 Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect.
147 I was pleasantly surprised!
148 The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters.
149 There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative.
150 All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon.
151 I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally.
152 He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store.
153 After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there.
154 BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed.
155 Great!
156 The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min).
157 They apologized for the wait, but no need for that!
158 The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great.
159 I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely.
160 Thanks, guys!
161 TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online.
162 They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.
163 I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.
164 Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
165 Food, absolutely horrible.
166 My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood.
167 After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye.
168 What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered.
169 What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style.
170 Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
171 Veggies, blah.
172 Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh.
173 In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English.
174 I've had it with this place.
175 If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle
176 (Un)fortunately for me, lux is close to my house.
177 I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.
178 The coffee and pastries are amazing.
179 They always play really great music too!
180 Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.
181 I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.
182 Did you catch that?
183 DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!
184 Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...
185 Chicken and Waffles.
186 Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.
187 In the ghetto?
188 Check
189 Has sweet tea?
190 Check
191 Has no-nonsense, quick service?
192 Check
193 Ridiculously long wait?
194 Check
195 Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?
196 Check
197 I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.
198 Now the waffles, probably the best ever...
199 The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.
200 The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.
201 If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.
202 Come real early or be prepared to wait.
203 Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.
204 Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.
205 Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...
206 This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life.
207 All the food is wonderful, though.
208 The calamari is not fried.
209 The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden.
210 This is great attention to detail.
211 I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted.
212 This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.
213 The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience.
214 He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.
215 I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again.
216 I went to return a belt... pretty simple.
217 Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway.
218 It took three other staff to help her out.
219 There were no words said to me except "Hold on".
220 I was pissed.
221 When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked "what do you want?"
222 Serious help is needed there!
223  If you work in the area of "customer service" I think you should have some.
224 Another night meeting friends here.
225 I have to laugh.
226 Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.
227 A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.
228 A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.
229 Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.
230 Management....
231 Pull your head out of your ass!
232 Sad to watch....
233 I need to talk my friends into another place!
234 Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.
235 Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones.
236 Hmmmmm.
237 Well asked the waitress about it and she said "they try the best they can"  hmmmmmm isn't this a "fish" restaurant?
238 They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.
239 This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.
240 Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online, Tempe and Casa Grande.
241 The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people.
242 This is our favorite breakfast place.
243 The food is good.
244 They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at.
245 The wait staff is friendly.
246 The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.
247 I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.
248 Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.
249 I knew I wanted a booklet-style, but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!
250 I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.
251 Thomas and his crew are stellar!
252 !
253 Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique.
254 As a server I make a very laid back customer.
255 I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter.
256 La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house.
257 Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it).
258 The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken.
259 Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer.
260 At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!
261 I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me.
262 You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.
263 I absolutely love this little spot!
264 It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find.
265 I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years.
266 Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to.
267 Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand.
268 Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.
269 The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need.
270 And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.
271 The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale.
272 For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds.
273 Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it.
274 : )
275 Came here with a large group a while back.
276 We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there.
277 It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour.
278 Happy Hour pricing was fair.
279 The food was pretty good.
280 The very best thing there is the beer!
281 They had like everything on tap!
282 MMMM!
283 This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing, just wandering how busy its goona be in there ???
284 little worried, can any one reply me ?
285 ?
286 Beer...or Yoga?
287 Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.
288 Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel.
289 After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous.
290 He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.
291 Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous.
292 The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school.
293 Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!).
294 But the gem is truly the practice space.
295 Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.
296 That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class!
297 It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.
298 As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself.
299 She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!
300 ).
301 So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!
302 She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.
303 I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in.
304 Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending:
305 NAMASTE!
306 really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.
307 my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone "name please?
308 ", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place.
309 we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem.
310 until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to "fit us in".
311 it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out.
312 it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff.
313 sorry, i don't plan very much ahead.
314 next time i will, and it won't be here.
315 anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could "squeeze in" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant.
316 she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars.
317 in words only office space could adequately describe,"coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?
318 ".
319 the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate.
320 we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm.
321 now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp.
322 not soggy and warm.
323 yuck.
324 the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg.
325 i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had.
326 my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for.
327 we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts.
328 you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.
329 this place was rather disappointing.
330 i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't.
331 it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland.
332 maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.
333 Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around.
334 First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.
335  I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.
336 If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes.
337 When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.
338 The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :)
339 Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining.
340 you will not be disappointed.
341 I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste!
342 They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone!
343 And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!
344 I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.
345 Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.
346 60 bucks for that?
347 I don't think so.
348 And when I mentioned it to "the person in charge", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.
349 Well, I'm your consumer, big guy.
350 Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better.
351 What food I did try, was pretty good.
352 The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...
353 Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...
354 I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)
355 So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor.
356 Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less!
357 Who would have thunk it.
358 Baristas were profesh and friendly.
359 They even warmed up our pastries upon request.
360 Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso.
361 I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.
362 Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.
363 I LOVE Chic Nails!
364 I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were "too busy" to take my friend and I in for pedicured.
365 We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since.
366 The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price.
367 I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!
368 P.S.
369 It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after!
370 :)
371 After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .
372 None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.
373 As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.
374 Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.
375 Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.
376 Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.
377 Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.
378 I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great.
379 I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.
380 They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!
381 We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!
382 I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.
383 He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation.
384 Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!
385 Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices.
386 Love it!
387 Christy is an amazing cake artist.
388 She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.
389 Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.
390 She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.
391 She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.
392 I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.
393 If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.
394 See the huge sign outside that says $2.50?
395 Yeah, that's for shirts only.
396 I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about $3.79.
397 As I sadly handed over my $5 bill, the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside.
398 No kidding.
399 I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the "advertised" fake price here.
400 Trying to make the best of it,  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service, and maybe that was worth a buck.
401 UH OH.
402 Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter, and was told I owed another $3.79.
403 I flat-out refused to pay twice.
404 She screamed at me, chased me to my car, wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting.
405 Ni-i-i-ice.
406 After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro.
407 We had a perfect meal there.
408 Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician.
409 Great wine.
410 Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion.
411 This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix.
412 If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here.
413 I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.
414 It's just like pizza bianco without the wait.
415 This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10.
416 This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for.
417 If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.
418 As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.
419 You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4.
420 If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.
421 I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.
422 My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).
423 The sushi here isn't bad.
424 It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.
425 As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller!
426 Would eat here again!!
427 !
428 'twas the night before booyah

446 of course, it was madness

448 crammed into the isles

479 makin' halloween, howl
480 Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.
481 Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.
482 They also have a big cheese selection.
483 I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.
484 The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.
485 He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.
486 The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .
487 My meal was good I had the duck.
488 She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.
489 Not fresh at all.
490 The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce.
491 Nothing too special.
492 Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.
493 If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.
494 Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.
495 We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.
496 We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.
497 Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.
498 Two thumbs way down.
499 Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.
500 I really try to like this place.
501 A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.
502 It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.
503 And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.
504 The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.
505 The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)
506 I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.
507 Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.
508 I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.
509 Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.
510 Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.
511 We began with an appetizer called "Table side guacamole" which was incredible to say the least.
512 It literally is made in front of your table.
513 Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.
514 Talk about tender meat!!
515 The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.
516 The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.
517 So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.
518 My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!
519 Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said "Happy Valentine's Day!"
520 and "Happy Birthday!"
521 to my fiance', which made the experience even better.
522 A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!
523 I have had a great experience every time I have been there.
524 The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.
525 Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.
526 Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm.
527 I love this restaurant!!
528 I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years.
529 Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint!
530 The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
531 The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg).
532 And the food?
533 Goes without saying, it's CRAVE worthy.
534 This is a new location, so I expected the usual growing pains.
535 But overall, a great dining experience.
536 Welcome to the neighborhood, SOL Cocina!
537 That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome.
538 5 stars.
539 The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either.
540 I like corn crunchy and it was not.
541 Service was great.
542 I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right?
543 (still 5 stars lol)
544 My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are...
545 I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.
546 The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.
547 For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich.
548 What I had:
549 Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni.
550 Maybe it was the panini bread.
551 I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton.
552 It wasn't anything to brag home about.
553 I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever.
554 I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was "anythings good."
555 Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts.
556 Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.
557 I can take an assortment home and have them for later.
558 Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches.
559 Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.
560 I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.
561 Good food, good service; no complaints.
562 Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.
563 The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.
564 I've only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.
565 I would recommend trying this restaurant.
566 Absolutely horrendous.
567 This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.
568 I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)!
569 I love the "hole in the wall" feel.
570 Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign.
571 I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onion and cheese).
572 The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection.
573 They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome.
574 The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it!
575 They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday.
576 Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!
577 Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place.
578 More often a miss.
579 :(
580 The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.
581 I'll pass.
582 Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first, given the fact that I really liked it.
583 What can I say?
584 I'm critical by nature.
585 I knew I was going back soon, so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.
586 Well, it just got it.
587 This place is fantastic.
588 In fact, if CenPho lets this one go under, I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.
589 However, that is unlikely to happen, because the food is damn tasty.
590 Today, the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning, topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.
591 The Soronan carne asada taco, char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; I'd rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.
592 Go to this place; I have a feeling I'll be here at least weekly.
593 When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more.
594 Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee.
595 Their hot chocolate is amazing.
596 Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service.
597 Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch.
598 Felt disrespected as a customer.
599 Service sucks stay away.
600 "bad service = bad review"
601 Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had, anywhere.
602 It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast.
603 I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door.
604 I'm not the only person that loves this place!
605 This place is fantastic!
606 We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm.
607 The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves, take our time, ask if we had any questions.
608 We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe.
609 Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything.
610 He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night.
611 This was a test for the guy behind the counter.
612 She didn't set a price limit, just said "show me your favorite."
613 He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point.
614 This is the mark of a good wine seller.
615 Find you what you want without bending you over on the price.
616 Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often.
617 I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.
618 We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!
619 Prices are on par with Total Wine, but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job.
620 Great job Sportsman's, see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!
621 Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread.
622 This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich.
623 My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal.
624 A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll.
625 The brioche was amazing.
626 It was light and fluffy.
627 The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock.
628 Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce.
629 This was perfectly done.
630 The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me.
631 This is a must-visit lunch time destination.
632 Dinner review shortly.
633 What a wonderful night.
634 It didn't start out that way.
635 I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at.
636 I heard the grief all the way there.
637 "Come on honey, it's an adventure!
638 ".
639 We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table.
640 Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers.
641 We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious!
642 I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special "gluten free" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat.
643 Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls.
644 He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!
645 The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful.
646 But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special.
647 Oh, the bathrooms were clean too.
648 Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's.
649 It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating.
650 (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)
651 I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work.
652 When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.
653 The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer.
654 And it's the best coffee I've ever had.
655 Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce.
656 Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.
657 Where to begin?
658 This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever.
659 I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed.
660 Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.
661 Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks.
662 I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for.
663 And IT'S.
664 SO.
665 CHEAP.
666 Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake.
667 It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait.
668 Always.
669 If you haven't gone... you're missing out.
670 I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.
671 We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!
672 I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??)
673 but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.
674 We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.
675 I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...
676 The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.
677 I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .
678 If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.
679 Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food.
680 Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix!
681 I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.
682 Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked.
683 It's not as good as the stuff back home.
684 And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York.
685 But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.
686 Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too.
687 Can't be bad!
688 !
689 This place is not there anymore.
690 Gaylee is great!
691 She is super sweet and so professional!
692 Her work is amazing.
693 I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere.
694 Keep up the great work!
695 Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.
696 After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.
697 Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.
698 Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.
699 As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.
700 The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ...
701 Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
702 I come here probably at least once a week.
703 The prices are right, there's a good variety of "ethnic" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful.
704 I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.
705 Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials
706 They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible.
707 =) GO TJ'S!
708 I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet.
709 When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk.
710 I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee.
711 This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good.
712 The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.
713 And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great.
714 I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite.
715 Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho.
716 Hippies scare me.
717 So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.
718 Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.
719 The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.
720 It was all for nothing.
721 No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.
722 This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level.
723 I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.
724 Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.
725 It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.
726 I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".
727 Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.
728 Thanks hippies!
729 Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service!
730 Liberty Market is definitely that!
731 Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).
732 Nice laid back decor too.
733 You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.
734 I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad.
735 The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size!
736 The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!
737 I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!!
738 This service is rare to find!
739 The restrooms are quite amusing!
740 Saw a similar set-up in NYC.
741 Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls.
742 They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)
743 I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ.
744 YUM!
745 Great experience from start to finish.
746 Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.
747 Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.
748 Was awesome.
749 Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.
750 The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.
751 My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.
752 The pasta came with shrimp, squash, and some other vegetables.
753 I love pesto, so this hit the spot.
754 Good serving size, but not too much.
755 The food tasted fresh.
756 They make their own pasta, which was delicious.
757 The burger was huge.
758 Looked like you get your moneys worth.
759 The ice tea was even good.
760 The place was clean and sleek.
761 They played good music and the service was perfect.
762 It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.
763 I will be coming back.
764 The host, who we later found out was the owner, was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.
765 I've said it before, but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.
766 Well done.
767 Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff!
768 Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers.
769 I would recommend giving him a call.
770 We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day.
771 I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome.
772 I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was.
773 I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience.
774 This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day.
775 My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!
776 Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!
777 They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some!
778 They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.
779 To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.
780 Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for?
781 I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.
782 As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.
783 They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?
784 I loved this little slice of heaven.
785 Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.
786 Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.
787 What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.
788 Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.
789 I have no reason to ever come here.
790 Certainly not free will.
791 The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.
792 AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.
793 You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience.
794 When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece.
795 The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers.
796 (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.)
797 Overall, a very different, fun look.
798 Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin.
799 That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.
800 They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything.
801 Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try.
802 Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done.
803 It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.
804 Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not.
805 (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)
806 Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing.
807 The whole experience was great (you won't get any specifics, this review is 3 weeks after, I can't remember, sorry).
808 Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly.
809 Explain food, wine, doesn't stay too long.
810 Nice interesting big room decor.
811 Looking forward to the next time.
812 Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place.
813 The pizza is cheap and good.
814 A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night.
815 The food & service was great!
816 I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!
817 I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a "glorified Red Lobster").
818 I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now.
819 For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing.
820 I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness.
821 I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food.
822 The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying.
823 I can't wait to come back here.
824 On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint.
825 The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect.
826 I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45.
827 So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it.
828 The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven.
829 The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either.
830 You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc.
831 Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza.
832 Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated.
833 The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!
834 !
835 PS GET THERE EARLY!
836 !
837 The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.
838 It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that "I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour" feeling.
839 The ingredients are fresh and delicious.
840 I am hooked!
841 Wednesday 7pm.
842 This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.
843 I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.
844 Service=slow.
845 Food=just tastes like salt
846 Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.
847 Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.
848 I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years.
849 They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.
850 I'll tell you "Why NOT"... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that.
851 More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.
852 That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had.
853 Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.
854 Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!
855 It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced "gourmet" pizza joint.
856 If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc.
857 I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago.
858 Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is.
859 Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step.
860 Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.
861 Excellent service and food
862 enjoyed live music on patio
863 Love Krista!
864 I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one.
865 Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!
866 Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!)
867 and also a wheat grinder.
868 Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!
869 Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products.
870 Well worth it to attend a class.
871 I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!
872 So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!
873 Need fig preserves?
874 They've got it.
875 Fennel?
876 It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department.
877 Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end?
878 The butcher has your back.
879 Duck fat?
880 Just take a peek in the freezer section.
881 Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...
882 AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel.
883 I came up empty handed on both items.
884 I say "simple" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise.
885 AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!
886 Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer.
887 How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?
888 This my friends, is why I love AJ's.
889 And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.
890 You truly do get what you pay for.
891 For all the employees at AJ's I say "THANK YOU!!"
892 for the great service you provide and the products you offer.
893 Love me some hidden house!
894 The music is too loud.
895 The drinks too cheap.
896 The clientele too local.
897 But I've never had anything but a good time there.
898 Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't.
899 And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be.
900 But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.
901 Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.
902 To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.
903 My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.
904 My only wish is that the serving was bigger!
905 I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.
906 The flavors in this salad are amazing!
907 Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.
908 For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.
909 The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.
910 It's great!
911 I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.
912 It was not good at all.
913 It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.
914 Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!
915 Great Mexican food.
916 Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.
917 Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada
918 Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.
919 I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong.
920 Not cheap.
921 I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 "designer brand" surcharge (no, I am not kidding).
922 Despite branding as "green" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience).
923 No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area.
924 Be warned!
925 What a fabulous dining experience!
926 My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays.
927 Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth.
928 The decor was great and the place was spotless.
929 We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items.
930 The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent!
931 The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly.
932 I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place.
933 Where are the managers????
934 It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.
935 Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.
936 The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.
937 Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.
938 Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.
939 She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.
940 Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.
941 One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.
942 Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.
943 HORRIBLE!
944 I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu.
945 My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order.
946 and she didn't get sick!!
947 woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!!
948 it was very good to!
949 i love good cheap food!!
950 Ill be back, they are always friendly.
951 Very good.
952 My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho.
953 I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho.
954 If in the area we will stop again for sure.
955 Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait.
956 Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.
957 About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done.
958 I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it.
959 I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me.
960 The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven.
961 I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.
962 My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also.
963 The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9.
964 We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper.
965 Not complaining because it was good but be ready.
966 There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange.
967 big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.
968 I would definilty go back and get the same stuff.
969 I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right.
970 My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.
971 Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast
972 Love this location at Gainey Ranch!
973 Great food consistently!
974 Our server Gary was awesome.
975 Food was amazing...an experience.
976 We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.
977 Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.
978 Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.
979 Be sure to give it a try.
980 I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it.
981 I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative.
982 This place is top notch.
983 Won't go to another place for my piercings again!
984 No way!
985 It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff!
986 Really impressed...I could go on and on!
987 I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy.
988 Love it!
989 The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress
990 OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill.
991 I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex.
992 I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning.
993 Seriously, I would be there every day...
994 The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon.
995 No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course.
996 Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about?
997 Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells.
998 Far more appetizing.
999 But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake?
1000 Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog.
1001 Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.
1002 What's not to love?
1003 Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly!
1004 I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip!
1005 We will definitely be back soon : )
1006 Excellent New Mexico style food, great hatch green chile.
1007 I love this location!
1008 The food is always great and the service is good.
1009 Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school.
1010 I come here almost everyday.
1011 I recommend this location to everyone.
1012 Awesome country club.
1013 Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.
1014 Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties.
1015 Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.
1016 Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.
1017 This is probably the sweet I crave the most!
1018 Salted Butter Caramel!
1019 Yummmm!
1020 When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.
1021 This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker!
1022 I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years.
1023 Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning.
1024 When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures.
1025 The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.
1026 I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc.
1027 Just incredible.
1028 I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....
1029 Still quite poor both in service and food.
1030 maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district.
1031 Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese.
1032 I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation.
1033 The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)
1034 Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion.
1035 On pointing this out all I got was " Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.
1036 Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food.
1037 Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier.
1038 Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior.
1039 It is all in poor taste...
1040 Great service
1041 My favorite Starbucks in Mesa.
1042 It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience.
1043 GREAT staff.
1044 First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.
1045 Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.
1046 Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner.
1047 We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.
1048 Okay, she doesn't know beer.
1049 We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.
1050 What the?
1051 I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.
1052 The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.
1053 Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.
1054 My meal was not memorable either.
1055 I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.
1056 We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.
1057 I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so.
1058 Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue?
1059 By all means, no.
1060 But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year.
1061 The sound quality is terrible.
1062 The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house.
1063 To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play?
1064 Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say "sacrificed or as important" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it).
1065 The venue is also hot.
1066 I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, "don't wear pants," honestly, that's a really good tip.
1067 The last show I saw here was in June.
1068 I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up.
1069 But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly "cooler" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c?
1070 The answer to that question is, maybe not.
1071 The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around.
1072 Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money.
1073 Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more.
1074 That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money!
1075 What a concept.
1076 Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively.
1077 Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.
1078 Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping.
1079 The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.
1080 The food was flavorful and plenty of it.
1081 Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud.
1082 My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots.
1083 It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor.
1084 I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy.
1085 You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food.
1086 I'd be happy to go back and try something different.
1087 If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.
1088 I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant.
1089 From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right!
1090 If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta.
1091 I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta.
1092 I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.
1093 Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle.
1094 A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra.
1095 Bonus!
1096 Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!
1097 we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!
1098 we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.
1099 this is definately going to be one of our "regular joints."
1100 if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.
1101 i bet you will like this place.
1102 there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.
1103 i love this place.
1104 this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!
1105 How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings?
1106 I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par.
1107 Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't.
1108 The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either.
1109 The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.
1110 But the food was way way too "greasy."
1111 And bland.
1112 And my stomach now aches after eating there....
1113 I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.
1114 This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.
1115 It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.
1116 I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.
1117 As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.
1118 Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!
1119 I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.
1120 Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!
1121 Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know.
1122 The mall of malls, for sure!
1123 So many designer boutiques, so little time!
1124 On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were!
1125 I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent.
1126 I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :)
1127 This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)
1128 What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse.
1129 Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular.
1130 How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys?
1131 It's a very welcome change.
1132 It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona.
1133 The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp.
1134 My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year.
1135 Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well.
1136 I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good.
1137 I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it.
1138 The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice.
1139 It was a really top notch recovery.
1140 This place is absolutely amazing.
1141 My wife and I live around the corner, hadn't eaten here in a few months.
1142 We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.
1143 Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland.
1144 Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent.
1145 Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump.
1146 It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it.
1147 Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S..
1148 Very disappointed !!!!
1149 From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street.
1150 For take out Asian !!!!
1151 Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!
1152 !
1153 So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli.
1154 I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed.
1155 I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing.
1156 However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding.
1157 They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills.
1158 I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free.
1159 Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well.
1160 The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon.
1161 Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!
1162 !
1163 After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.
1164 I really like the atmosphere.
1165 It was sleek yet cozy.
1166 The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.
1167 A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots.
1168 As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.
1169 Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.
1170 SideBar is just that kind of establishment.
1171 If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.
1172 @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.
1173 It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples.
1174 :)
1175 I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.
1176 Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.
1177 In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.
1178 All good.
1179 This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).
1180 All delicious.
1181 The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.
1182 My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.
1183 Seriously loved it.
1184 As good as it gets.
1185 We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).
1186 We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.
1187 When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.
1188 For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).
1189 Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.
1190 Overall, just incredible.
1191 Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.
1192 My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.
1193 We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.
1194 For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie V's never lets you down!
1195 Also, their Banana's Foster is divine!
1196 Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!
1197 There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.
1198 Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse.
1199 Heart be still I loved this place.
1200 Way better than I expected.
1201 I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point.
1202 For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now.
1203 Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food.
1204 I'll be back!
1205 Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.
1206 Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.
1207 She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.
1208 Damn her!!!
1209 I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.
1210 So hurry over and pick up some bargains!
1211 And wish Amber good luck!
1212 This is my favorite spa in the world!
1213 Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven.
1214 Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best.
1215 Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room.
1216 Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured.
1217 I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast).
1218 I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.
1219 If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment.
1220 I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule.
1221 3 syllables for this place.
1222 A-MAZ-ING!
1223 The best Phoenix has to offer.
1224 I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door.
1225 I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.
1226 When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for.
1227 When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends.
1228 The whole family agrees.
1229 I don't understand the negative reviews.
1230 The reviewers must have had a bad day.
1231 I love the food and so has everyone  I know.
1232 The food and service were both amazing.
1233 I've had the gyro pita, orzo and greek potatoes.
1234 All were fantastic.
1235 Try the gelato also.
1236 It's the best in town!
1237 The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer.
1238 Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn.
1239 While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm.
1240 I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception.
1241 This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night.
1242 Breakfast:
1243 Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced.
1244 They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns.
1245 It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast.
1246 Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd!
1247 Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain.
1248 Lunch:
1249 Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich.
1250 The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce.
1251 The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular.
1252 I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind.
1253 If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.
1254 We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.
1255 When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.
1256 i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.
1257 Ok, I'll wait.
1258 Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.
1259 We were there for about 10min already.
1260 That's when she said to us.
1261 "Your table inside is ready"  she walked us right there and we were sat.
1262 WOW!
1263 that was quick!
1264 We ordered drinks and food.
1265 I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.
1266 For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.
1267 It definitely hit the spot.
1268 My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.
1269 I wont let that affect the rating though.
1270 Awesome place!
1271 We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time.
1272 We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids.
1273 My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had.
1274 I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it.
1275 Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know.
1276 Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips!
1277 Now I call that customer service.
1278 We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant.
1279 Looking forward to going back someday.
1280 Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.
1281 A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me, assessed my problem, and quoted a very fair price to fix it.
1282 This guy was way too clean, personable and professional to be the plumber?
1283 He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time!
1284 You have to understand...
1285 I am use to a dirty, loud, intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt!
1286 These guys won me over and their telephone number 623-977-4458 is in my cell phone now.
1287 I highly recommend Palmer's Plumbing!!
1288 !
1289 I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!
1290 Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.
1291 I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!
1292 My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.
1293 I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!
1294 Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store.
1295 He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family.
1296 Thanks Alex!
1297 It's the place to be.
1298 I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle.
1299 Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe...
1300 I had to try it.
1301 Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City.
1302 The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.
1303 My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza.
1304 Very good choice!
1305 The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish.
1306 The pizza was much bigger than we expected.
1307 For $10 you really do get a good deal.
1308 We each orded drinks.
1309 A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling.
1310 Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything.
1311 My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.
1312 Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.
1313 Definitely one of my favorite places to eat, hands down.
1314 I love their enchiladas verdes combo.
1315 Their refried beans are THE BEST!
1316 I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.
1317 Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.
1318 Yes, it is in a bad area, but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good, real Mexican food at a great price, to head down there.
1319 And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing.
1320 This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17.
1321 It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.
1322 Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.
1323 flemings is always top notch.
1324 we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass.
1325 The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list.
1326 then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner.
1327 so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful.
1328 salads, soup lamb chops and filet.
1329 i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings.
1330 they also have a great happy hour.
1331 oK, first i broke my promise to myself and went here again, i figured by now things have got to be better.
1332 i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold, French Toast.
1333 ok so the french toast is good.
1334 but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it.
1335 and on top of it.
1336 my friends food was cold again.
1337 one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal, but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.
1338 well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides.
1339 and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad.
1340 lol.
1341 so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt.
1342 and cold sausage to boot.
1343 the friend with the mishmash, lol.
1344 i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom.
1345 how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?
1346 i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm.
1347 i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.
1348 can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?
1349 I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.
1350 The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.
1351 It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.
1352 The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.
1353 Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.
1354 My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!
1355 Our favorite things to get are the "boneless buffalo wings" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu "the Wendy's pickle sandwich" It is amazing!
1356 Another special they have from time to time is "the big WAC" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!
1357 !
1358 This is a must try for any Mani Pedi fan.
1359 I use to drive to Scottsdale for all of my services until I found this spot.
1360 Get the pedi, no metal file pedi once - and you will NEVER go any where else.
1361 Have fun.
1362 I do..Customer service - top end.
1363 Thanks
1364 They have some rude employees its unbelievable.
1365 I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look.
1366 Not customer friendly.
1367 At all.
1368 I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight.
1369 First time at Switch.
1370 Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese.
1371 All delicious!
1372 Next my wife orders the blackened salmon.
1373 I looked at her with my wtf scowl.
1374 We don't even eat seafood.
1375 "It looks interesting" she says.
1376 Whatever.
1377 It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen.
1378 We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love.
1379 The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world.
1380 Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top.
1381 We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef.
1382 She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes.
1383 Jason is touched by the hand of God.
1384 He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night.
1385 I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod.
1386 Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.
1387 Perfect night.
1388 Thank you Jason and Switch.
1389 New to the Scottsdale area, I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks.
1390 I stumbled upon this place and was very happy.
1391 Although it's in a weird strip mall, it's really relaxing inside.
1392 My gel manicure was perfect, and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra!
1393 Totally recommend!
1394 The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great.
1395 I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.
1396 I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:
1397 Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, "sorry, we don't serve your type here."
1398 Mushroom says "why not?
1399 I'm a fungi (fun guy)."
1400 I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.
1401 I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.
1402 The portions are really small for the price that they charge.
1403 There is too much tortilla for the meat.
1404 I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.
1405 RIP AZ Coffee Connection.
1406 :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.
1407 I am severely bummed.
1408 This place is irreplaceable!
1409 Damn you, Starbucks and McDonalds!
1410 I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd.
1411 They really suck.
1412 I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!
1413 I am so disappointed.
1414 I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast.
1415 I came home, froze two and cooked one.
1416 It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.
1417 I trusted his opinion and cooked it.
1418 Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty.
1419 It was gross but no one got sick luckily.
1420 Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse.
1421 It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is.
1422 It is definitely bad.
1423 And it gets even worse!
1424 As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it.
1425 Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too.
1426 What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.
1427 They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money.
1428 I have had it with them!
1429 I am not surprised.
1430 They have always been trouble.
1431 Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food.
1432 His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty "I don't care" attitude.
1433 I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!
1434 The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted.
1435 The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time.
1436 It is really gross; top dollar for top trash!
1437 My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the "questionable meat" instead of throwing it out!
1438 I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff.
1439 BLEECH!!!
1440 I think I ate that in the last one!
1441 just say no.
1442 this place is truly awful.
1443 too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.
1444 I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!
1445 !
1446 If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.
1447 I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things.
1448 Well one night when we were kidless we went.
1449 It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived.
1450 We were both very impressed.
1451 Warm homemade bread.
1452 Awesome salads.
1453 I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth.
1454 My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers.
1455 We will definitely go back!
1456 Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout!
1457 Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks!
1458 Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed.
1459 I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue).
1460 The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.
1461 He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.
1462 Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth?
1463 I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously?
1464 Like, did you propose there or something???
1465 ?
1466 There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yragui's Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.
1467 The value  of knowledge of the body, the commitment of service, the excellence of research for each individual client.
1468 The degree that she possesses cannot be measured with a dollar amount because no dollar amount can beat this value.
1469 It is value what goes far beyond what you receive each and every time you see Tina.
1470 Tina is a healer and is dedicated to you.
1471 It just doesn't get any better!

1474 Food middle of the road...
1475 The staff is rude..
1476 Seems like it starts with the owner.
1477 I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.
1478 I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open.
1479 For a long time it was the only choice in the area.
1480 Now there are multiple choices.
1481 If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.
1482 If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.
1483 The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.
1484 The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).
1485 My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, "nope that's what green looks like".
1486 WOW!
1487 Sorry but I don't think I will be returning.
1488 I have been here many times, pretty much can't go wrong here.
1489 prices are good service is prompt and friendly.
1490 As an artist, I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies.
1491 Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!!
1492 Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied.
1493 I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles.
1494 Yes, this is my kind of art supply store!
1495 As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint, easels and canvases to ceramic tools, an overwheming desire to create comes over me.
1496 AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!
1497 Although this store is smaller, the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item.
1498 If you're looking for exceptional quality, a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff, Arizona Art Supply is your best bet.
1499 So yummy in my tummy.
1500 My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy.
1501 We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot.
1502 We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot.
1503 It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey.
1504 But overall, awesome service and yummy food!
1505 We will be back!
1506 !
1507 They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated).
1508 When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!!
1509 They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools.
1510 Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork.
1511 We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food.
1512 Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy.
1513 We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup ("Yum-O" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice!
1514 The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent.
1515 Our family of five finished nearly everything.
1516 :D so GOOOOOD!
1517 Going to come back soon!
1518 Check this place out!
1519 LOVE the food!!!
1520 !
1521 I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.
1522 First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization.
1523 Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with.
1524 My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman.
1525 No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him.
1526 The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets?
1527 The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with.
1528 The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously.
1529 You won't be disappointed.
1530 These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.
1531 They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.
1532 Everyone I encountered was great.
1533 Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.
1534 When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.
1535 Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.
1536 I love boba drinks but hate the word "boba".
1537 I always feel like an ape when I say that word.
1538 Anyways.
1539 There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?)
1540 So!
1541 When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.
1542 I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good.
1543 I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes.
1544 Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available.
1545 I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged.
1546 I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried.
1547 She went above and beyond my expectations.
1548 The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies.
1549 All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations.
1550 I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.
1551 Love it.
1552 Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.
1553 Glad I did.
1554 It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.
1555 They also sell all things culinary Italia.
1556 When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.
1557 I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.
1558 I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).
1559 Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.
1560 The sub is easily the best I've had.
1561 Amazing.
1562 I also purchased a cannoli.
1563 I'm picky about these things.
1564 Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.
1565 Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).
1566 The cannoli was top notch.
1567 Simply the best.
1568 Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.
1569 I cannot wait to return.
1570 I only open they were open past 6pm.
1571 One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80.
1572 diagnosis fee and split.
1573 Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300.
1574 for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for.
1575 Stay away!
1576 I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today, hopefully they will stop this nonsense.
1577 this another place that i would give no stars to if possible.
1578 it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.
1579 i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen.
1580 for some reason, it's right by the door.
1581 instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.
1582 after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here.
1583 the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.
1584 seriously, I'm really curious how this place survives.
1585 awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe.
1586 what is wrong with the world?
1587 1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco.
1588 I let that go & figured was a mistake.
1589 When I went again, ordered different item & same result.
1590 Little to no meat.
1591 I will not be going back.
1592 My Fiance and I went here today for the first time.
1593 We shared a meat pie
1594 and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish.
1595      ALL of it was amazing.
1596 I cannot speak highly enough of their food.
1597 Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick.
1598 The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated.
1599 All over, the ambiance was pleasant.
1600 I look forward to returning!
1601 Buckle is a really cool store.
1602 They carry both men and women's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans.
1603 From Silver to Lucky, they're all there!
1604 They also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar.
1605 It's nice because this store has its own style...kinda casual, a little funky, but definitely different than anything you'd find at Macy's or Nordstrom's.
1606 They also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful.
1607 You'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches, you'll get $10 or $15 off.
1608 The clothes range in price, but generally, I'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable.
1609 This location is in Paradise Valley Mall- check it out!
1610 Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.
1611 It is a great studio.
1612 Kim is so friendly and fun.
1613 I would highly recommend the yoga classes.
1614 They are both challenging and relaxing!
1615 It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.
1616 I definitely recommend it!
1617 I freakin love this place.
1618 My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused.
1619 Now that's just funny.
1620 My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here.
1621 Now I'm a pro.
1622 Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook.
1623 Mmmm....good.
1624 If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all..
1625 I kid you not, I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50)
1626 have I mentioned the minnie arcade?
1627 Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...
1628 Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything!
1629 made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!.
1630 Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING!
1631 and their Mac n Cheese is a must have!
1632 I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.
1633 A short review but you get the gist of it...
1634 WOW this place is good!
1635 SO good!
1636 And not just yummy good, but intrinsically good.
1637 Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - http://essencebakery.com/essence_bakery_environmentally_friendly.shtml !
1638 That, and it's cute.
1639 And it tastes Yummy!
1640 And they are SO nice!
1641 SOOO nice!
1642 And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good.
1643 I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just $3.50.
1644 Bite sized so not too bad, but if I bought them today they'd be gone before I got home.
1645 I got their grilled cheese w/ mozzarella, basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side.
1646 It will be hard to not come here every week.
1647 I love that all the drinks are refillable - and it's up to you to refill them.
1648 Coffee, tea or soda, just walk on up and fill your glass.
1649 And I love that it's all so fresh and local!
1650 Important note - You order at the counter, they give you a number and bring out your food.
1651 If you're paying w/ debit card, they will ask you if you want to include a tip.
1652 That threw me.
1653 I'd been in the place less than 2 minutes - how do I know if it's worth the tip - or how much of a tip it's worth??
1654 Bring some cash or plan to deal w/ that question accordingly.
1655 What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.
1656 Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!
1657 He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.
1658 He was right!
1659 Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.
1660 My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot "warm" cocoa.
1661 Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.
1662 Everyone was really friendly, though.
1663 The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!
1664 We will be back.
1665 I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.
1666 Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.
1667 The waiter had major attitude.
1668 Avoid this place!
1669 Love it!!!
1670 Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss.
1671 Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering.
1672 If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again.
1673 YUMMY!
1674 I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.
1675 Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.
1676 I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.
1677 It was a different restaurant.
1678 I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.
1679 The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.
1680 The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.
1681 And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.
1682 I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.
1683 It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.
1684 Comes with pico and guacamole.
1685 I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.
1686 Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.
1687 I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times.
1688 I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices.
1689 This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMO's and pesticides.
1690 So, I was already a fan before I walked in!
1691 Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers.
1692 The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor!
1693 They have a little something for everyone.
1694 I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions.
1695 We always both leave happy.
1696 I definitely recommend this place.
1697 I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time!
1698 :)
1699 Tried them out for Restaurant Week.
1700 The food and service was excellent.
1701 I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere.
1702 We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.
1703 The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order.
1704 My family and I ate here just a few days ago.
1705 It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family.
1706 First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine.
1707 Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30.
1708 When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults.
1709 Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight!
1710 The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!!
1711 Seriously?
1712 We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand.
1713 Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left!
1714 She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!!
1715 We all ordered and the food arrived quickly.
1716 This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say.
1717 We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent.
1718 My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) .
1719 The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather.
1720 Overall, none of us will be returning to this place!
1721 It was is so overrated.
1722 We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.
1723 It does not get much better than this, fellas.
1724 BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.
1725 Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.
1726 Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday.
1727 Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke.
1728 Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.
1729 It definitely has a "Cheers" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever.
1730 Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.
1731 Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at.
1732 3,000 people attended in 2007.
1733 I was severely mislead by Frank A's, "It's hot, but the food ain't bad."
1734 review.
1735 It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.
1736 You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.
1737 I really like this place alot.
1738 their pizza's are really different but really good!
1739 I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection!
1740 Major thumbs up!
1741 !
1742 Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine!
1743 The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before.
1744 I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air.
1745 While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try!
1746 Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of.
1747 Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.
1748 They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge "by the glass" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!
1749 The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them!
1750 My one complaint is petty: their website.
1751 Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!
1752 Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.
1753 The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.
1754 And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.
1755 OMG amazing.
1756 I'm currently craving it the day after.
1757 Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...
1758 I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.
1759 They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.
1760 I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!
1761 This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.
1762 I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.
1763 This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.
1764 We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.
1765 Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!
1766 This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!
1767 Would have to agree with Rana A below...
1768 I think she said it best
1769 Actually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...
1770 Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night.
1771 OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say "you mean the one in Scottsdale" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...
1772 when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid.
1773 therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.
1774 well, i hit the jackpot.
1775 $15 coupon for a FEAST.
1776 the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides.
1777 there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY.
1778 it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was.
1779 popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...
1780 our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us.
1781 one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress.
1782 'ill have a diet coke?'
1783 then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.
1784 i lost it and started laughing.
1785 why isn't she talking to us?
1786 this is so weird.
1787 we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar.
1788 you didn't get all of that.
1789 it just says you do but you don't.
1790 the food ended up being nasty.
1791 probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.
1792 as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing.
1793 awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.
1794 if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.
1795 Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.
1796 It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.
1797 The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.
1798 Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.
1799 The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.
1800 They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.
1801 The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.
1802 Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.
1803 Nooooooooo!
1804 Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.
1805 Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.
1806 So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.
1807 So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.
1808 Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory.
1809 You shall be missed.
1810 This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk.
1811 I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation.
1812 I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day.
1813 The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works.
1814 Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town.
1815 They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.
1816 Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out.
1817 From what I understand there will be seating outside too.
1818 Most importantly however is the coffee.
1819 They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel.
1820 I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect.
1821 Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.
1822 Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street.
1823 Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night.
1824 Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great?
1825 Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny!
1826 I have a thing for always trying the "odd" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu!
1827 This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone!
1828 My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself.
1829 Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!
1830 This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good.
1831 This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu.
1832 What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill.
1833 The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!
1834 Drinks
1835 1.
1836 Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice.
1837 2.
1838 If you bring in your own "pimp cup" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.
1839 Food
1840 1.
1841 VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing.
1842 2.
1843 Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.
1844 Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.
1845 I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.
1846 I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.
1847 The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.
1848 But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.
1849 HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October)
1850 it hurts my lungs to breath.
1851 I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.
1852 The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!
1853 !
1854 ~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*
1855 I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.
1856 I graduated with a magna cum laude.
1857 I have attended other universities.
1858 However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.
1859 For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.
1860 Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.
1861 Very little hands-on and help with internships.
1862 Way too much groupwork and free-riding.
1863 They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.
1864 Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.
1865 They have their teaching assistants teach us.
1866 Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.
1867  Junior year when you get admitted into the "professional program" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.
1868 The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)
1869 There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.
1870 The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.
1871 Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.
1872 Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state.
1873 Its not worth it.
1874 Expect to wait in line wherever you go.
1875 ASU accepts way too many people.
1876 It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.
1877 Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.
1878 The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.
1879 They are not informed enough to advise you.
1880 I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.
1881 I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.
1882 Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.
1883 Gross!
1884 !
1885 One thing I liked was the student theatre performances.
1886 The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.
1887 The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.
1888 ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.
1889 I have been approached by many shady people.
1890 do NOT live on campus.
1891 Especially the dorms on north campus.
1892 They are beyond crappy and overpriced.
1893 You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.
1894 The "freshman year experience" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.
1895 and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).
1896 I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.
1897 Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student.
1898 Hope this helps.
1899 Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail.
1900 No personal message on his answering machine at all.
1901 Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does.
1902 I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone.
1903 So fed up with flaky contractors.
1904 Do they want work or not?
1905 I'm not a fan of ice cream, I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat.
1906 However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically it's much less fattening, yet more satisfying.
1907 At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoon's is the best around.
1908 There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog.
1909 You also can get more than one flavor combined.
1910 They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.
1911 Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that.
1912 Phenom.
1913 The food is always fresh and well seasoned.
1914 A good selection of Tequila.
1915 Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic.
1916 The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared.
1917 It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice.
1918 It averages about $10 a plate but worth it.
1919 This is how really good Mexican should be.
1920 The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose.
1921 All freshly made.
1922 I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish.
1923 Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd.
1924 They have TV's for your viewing pleasure.
1925 Service is friendly and quick.
1926 I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale.
1927 Good food.
1928 You won't be disappointed.
1929 Bring a flashlight.
1930 It is so dark inside you can not read the menu.
1931 But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations.
1932 We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate.
1933 They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.
1934 The wine list is extensive and expensive.
1935 If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating .
1936 Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .
1937 These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.
1938 I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.
1939 I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.
1940 I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.
1941 I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a "GOOD" Pizza.
1942 After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia!
1943 I love the hole in the wall vibe!
1944 Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty!
1945 The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!!
1946 I love it!
1947 My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads.
1948 I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home.
1949 Every pizza place likes to say its "New York Style", but this place really does a NYC pizza.
1950 Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water.
1951 food is ok, but service is very slow!
1952 Very delicious and friendly!
1953 They do happy hour every day which is so great!
1954 The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees.
1955 I love how close this is to my house.
1956 We visit this place quite frequently!
1957 Oh, YEAH!!!
1958 Coming to Scottsdale.
1959 I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale.
1960 I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service.
1961 Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!!
1962 Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk.
1963 Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!
1964 !
1965 I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.
1966 We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.
1967 We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.
1968 He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.
1969 I was amazed at how natural it tasted.
1970 There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.
1971 These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.
1972 I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.
1973 There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.
1974 YUMMY!
1975 The best gyro you will have in Arizona...
1976 or maybe anywhere.
1977 Love the grocery selection.
1978 Everyone there is really nice.
1979 And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.
1980 Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east?
1981 Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too.
1982 No thanks.
1983 The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.
1984 I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!
1985 Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist.
1986 :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.
1987 i love this place.
1988 very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on.
1989 when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night.
1990 where else can i go and request the cramps?
1991 i...love...this...place, it makes me happy.
1992 i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't.
1993 go and experience it for yourself.
1994 Hands down a great lil joint!
1995 Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!
1996 Maestro Chris Bianco whips up addictive sandwiches at his laboratory on Central Avenue.
1997 Ingredients are local and super-fantastic.
1998 Check out what today's market sandwich is -- if it's oven-roasted pork, buy it immediately.
1999 Don't miss the rice pudding.
2000 We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.
2001 Good food, good service, good ambiance.
2002 We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!
2003 Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of "computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.
2004 The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!)
2005 and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.
2006 But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.
2007 Really?!?
2008 You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???
2009 It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!
2010 It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.
2011 I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.
2012 She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that!
2013  Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.
2014 Okay I have found my new favorite "home office!"
2015 I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.
2016 Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.
2017 Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi.
2018 It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.
2019 Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.
2020 The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.
2021 Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.
2022 The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).
2023 My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.
2024 I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.
2025 A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.
2026 Can you tell I am a fan yet?
2027 I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.
2028 There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.
2029 I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.
2030 I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home.
2031 About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.
2032 I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated.
2033 My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.
2034 This my favorite Chipotle ever!!!
2035 It's so consistent and good!
2036 No hormones in the meat makes this "fast" food an A+ for me!!!
2037 Yum!!
2038 !
2039 This place is amazing.
2040 Absolutely LEGIT.
2041 Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor).
2042 The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference).
2043 Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more.
2044 And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good.
2045 I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now.
2046 Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk.
2047 I'll never be the same.
2048 Suffered a senior moment today!
2049 Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review!
2050 lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful.
2051 Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me.
2052 The place was full tonight and I can see why.
2053 Question is will I remember?
2054 great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular
2055 Here's the 1.
2056 2.
2057 3...
2058 1.
2059 Great Food.
2060 I love hot New Mexico style food.
2061 Good job.
2062 2.
2063 They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers.
2064 Unfortunately, they're all shitty.
2065 3.
2066 They could REALLY improve the service.
2067 No Bueno!
2068 We'll be back for the food.
2069 It might be take out next time though!
2070 4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review.
2071 I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site.
2072 More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant.
2073 Good Food folks, just get it to go!
2074 To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves!
2075 You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!!
2076 Learn how to work, Kid!
2077 This is my favorite haunt.
2078 Whether it be St. Patricks Day, before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink.
2079 Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great.
2080 The food is the good, whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner.
2081 This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me.
2082 I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls.
2083 It was good.
2084 The vegetables were fresh and delicious.
2085 Plans to visit again.
2086 Delish & authentic!
2087 The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2).
2088 The injera was good (not too thick/doughy).
2089 Spicy and yummy.
2090 I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony.
2091 Amazing clothing and fantastic deals!
2092 As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items.
2093 The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.
2094 My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try.
2095 Huge mistake!
2096 The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good.
2097 We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out.
2098 The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager.
2099 She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat.
2100 We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back.
2101 Don't do it, you will regret it!
2102 This will be a simple post...I love indian food, and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az.
2103 The Chicken makhani is so buttery, so savory...the Chicken tikka masala, the best I ever had.
2104 Service is always good, the food comes out fast.
2105 It's not super cheap, since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart, but it is worth it.
2106 If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers.
2107 When in rome!
2108 The BEST of the BEST!
2109 I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs.
2110 Food melts in your mouth.
2111 Make this your next restaurant stop.
2112 You will not be disappointed.
2113 One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.
2114 1.
2115 I am a HUGE champagne fan 2.
2116 You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4.
2117 I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.
2118 My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.
2119 The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.
2120 It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.
2121 The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation.
2122 Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service.
2123 Yay!
2124 After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!
2125 From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!)
2126 this place is 5 star.
2127 I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.
2128 This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!
2129 ).
2130 Highlights:
2131 Tasty drink menu
2132 Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style
2133 Great part of town
2134 Sexy servers...dang
2135 Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!
2136 Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!!
2137 Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.
2138 She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too.
2139 I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.
2140 Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one.
2141 The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.
2142 Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back
2143 Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife.
2144 :)
2145 Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.
2146 Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station.
2147 I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.
2148 I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town.
2149 Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.
2150 With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor.
2151 Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it.
2152 Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what?
2153 Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station.
2154 Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.
2155 Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.
2156 They may be closed for good.
2157 Not sure.
2158 Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix.
2159 They're real, and they're spectacular.
2160 Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable.
2161 Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet.
2162 Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city.
2163 Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded.
2164 Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.
2165 Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was "Squaw" Peak.
2166 This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state.
2167 Native Americans are offended by the term "Squaw", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as "Negress" or "Jewess".
2168 In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater.
2169 The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea.
2170 They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.
2171 And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue.
2172 She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation.
2173 A fitting end to the debate.
2174 NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.
2175 I just love Chipotle.
2176 Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be).
2177 And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus!
2178 My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.
2179 Guacamole and hot sauce on the side.
2180 So delicious!!!
2181 The person who did our order was so nice!
2182 It was my friend's first Chipotle experience!
2183 She was impressed by how big the burrito was.
2184 I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back.
2185 I love you, Marquee Theatre.
2186 Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed.
2187 I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee.
2188 The bartenders are really friendly, the bouncers do a great job, and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal.
2189 Not to mention, the sound guys do an awesome job.
2190 I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show.
2191 One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there.
2192 The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set....
2193 Please don't speak...
2194 I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks.
2195 All in all, I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time.
2196 Their food was GREAT!
2197 I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice!
2198 The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!
2199 Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!
2200 FINALMENTE!!
2201 !
2202 Andiamo....
2203 FOOD
2204 --------
2205 Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers.
2206 For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini.
2207 The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive?
2208 Very interesting.
2209 The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.
2210 Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca.
2211 Man.
2212 This is the real deal.
2213 Orecchiette is the "little ear" pasta and "alla puttanesca" means it's made "whore style".
2214 And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.
2215 The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.)
2216 it worked really well with the orecchiette.
2217 And the sauce.
2218 Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5.
2219 The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony.
2220 Nothing overpowered the other.
2221 Subtle and humble home food.
2222 It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.
2223 As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, "oh ok, this is a European serving.
2224 I'm still going to be starving after this."
2225 And, um, nope.
2226 Why?
2227 Because I slowed down.
2228 I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish.
2229 And by the end, was I hungry?
2230 Not at all.
2231 I really enjoyed this meal.
2232 And the serving was just right.
2233 Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table.
2234 SERVICE
2235 -------------
2236 Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant.
2237 Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table.
2238 And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable.
2239 Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business.
2240 And I felt the same for them.
2241 SETTING
2242 -------------
2243 I would say the space was just the right size.
2244 Not a cavernous place in the least.
2245 Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller.
2246 It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it.
2247 But I like it a little hidden off, actually.
2248 The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel.
2249 No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that.
2250 There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back.
2251 Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked.
2252 I definitely don't think this is going to be as "scene-y" as Sens.
2253 It has a completely different vibe.
2254 EXTRA CRIB NOTES
2255 -----------------------------
2256 * the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta.
2257 No veal parm here.
2258 And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
2259 * It's great
2260 * Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18.
2261 I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
2262 * it's great
2263 * No liquor license (yet).
2264 For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda).
2265 * it's great
2266 * complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
2267 * it's great
2268 * It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends!
2269 What more could you ask for?
2270 * did I tell you it's great?
2271 ALL IN ALL
2272 ---------------
2273 An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content.
2274 And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all.
2275 I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open.
2276 A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.
2277 And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...
2278 This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.
2279 This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter, friendlier staff.
2280 The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.
2281 I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.
2282 I went to AMC last month, and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either.
2283 If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend.
2284 Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training......
2285 Yep, I'm a cheesehead.
2286 (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me.
2287 Really.)
2288 What can I say?
2289 I like Culver's.
2290 It reminds me of home.
2291 It's total comfort food.
2292 Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts.
2293 What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye?
2294 The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh.
2295 And tasty.
2296 Culver's is known for their frozen custard.
2297 What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, "Hey, that sounds good!!
2298 ", and quickly pulled into the parking lot?
2299 If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories.
2300 Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's.
2301 You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states.
2302 Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it.
2303 But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there.
2304 Give it a chance....see if you like it.
2305 Let's be honest, when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.
2306 If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.
2307 Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.
2308 Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?)
2309 and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.
2310 I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.
2311 He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.
2312 He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.
2313 During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.
2314 I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.
2315 Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did.
2316 This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.
2317 Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.
2318 We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.
2319 She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.
2320 She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.
2321 My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.
2322 Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.
2323 She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.
2324 She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.
2325 At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.
2326 I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.
2327 They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.
2328 They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.
2329 I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.
2330 OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!
2331 Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!
2332 It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!
2333 I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl!
2334 You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive!
2335 I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.
2336 Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture!
2337 There's also Orange chicken...
2338 This dish is completely the bee's knees.
2339 It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.
2340 Their house beef?
2341 Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms?
2342 Heaven.
2343 Simple and delicious.
2344 And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.
2345 Their fried rice might seem a little "heavy" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.
2346 Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.
2347 Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.
2348 As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.
2349 But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!
2350 I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.
2351 Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.
2352 The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday "brown bag" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.
2353 Gangplank rocks.
2354 Nuff said.
2355 @iamtimhardy
2356 I'm President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide.
2357 Tylor the GM and team run a good shop.
2358 Very friendly.
2359 Don't get me wrong, they are there to make money but they are not push.
2360 You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions.
2361 Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything.
2362 They know bikes and parts inside an out.
2363 Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic.
2364 I did not say cheap, but fair.
2365 Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week.
2366 In the past they had a 1/2 price on all their helmets.
2367 Got a Scorpion $220 helmet for about $110.
2368 Just ask what and when they are having specials.
2369 I don't buy the review below about bait and switch, pretty serious accusation.
2370 However, GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well.
2371 Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness.
2372 The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for.
2373 I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.
2374 Can't wait til I can walk here!
2375 Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like.
2376 For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great!
2377 We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing.
2378 I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust.
2379 Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant.
2380 Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.
2381 No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.
2382 The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.
2383 They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.
2384 I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.
2385 We ended up moving about 15 minutes away, but still make the trip to see this vet.
2386 No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out "In and Out Man I love that place" I think that says it all.
2387 Video Paradise is great.
2388 For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.
2389 The selection is staggering.
2390 I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.
2391 The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.
2392 I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.
2393 "You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?
2394 Lame!"
2395 I mean, come on.
2396 No one else has it.
2397 This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).
2398 They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.
2399 The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.
2400 You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection.
2401 Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday.
2402 So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.
2403 We started out with the spinach artichoke dip.
2404 The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth.
2405 O.M.G.
2406 Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness.
2407 But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.
2408 However, I was not daunted.
2409 She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?)
2410 and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous.
2411 We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides.
2412 All were very good, but the carrots really stood out.
2413 The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous.
2414 But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall.
2415 A food coma was certain.
2416 I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.
2417 Then came the white chocolate brownie.
2418 So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream.
2419 It was all we could to to make a dent in it.
2420 We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient?
2421 Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin.
2422 And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges.
2423 I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles.
2424 Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read "SWAG" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff.
2425 (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.)
2426 It's actually WCG.
2427 [* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed "Dolphin" as one of its menu items.
2428 I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi.
2429 'Oh,' I responded.
2430 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.'
2431 Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]
2432 I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box.
2433 The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on.
2434 And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.
2435 I am so not a fan of the dentist.
2436 But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.
2437 Professional, yet relaxed attitudes.
2438 From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.
2439 While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's "Smile" book that shows some of his work.
2440 WOW!
2441 He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.
2442 He does some fabulous cosmetic work!
2443 I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless.
2444 So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!
2445 Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).
2446 Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?
2447 I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.
2448 Does that matter?
2449 Nope.
2450 Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.
2451 He thinks of everything.
2452 I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.
2453 I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.
2454 You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.
2455 The best tai in downtown for the price!
2456 Masiman is the most tasty dish here!
2457 Totally dissapointed.
2458 I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.
2459 The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.
2460 The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.
2461 My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.
2462 They were cold when they were served.
2463 We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.
2464 My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!
2465 and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!
2466 I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.
2467 This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.
2468 I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!
2469 Man, I love Southwest.
2470 Best airline ever.
2471 After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.
2472 It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.
2473 Cheers to that!
2474 This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling.
2475 The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude.
2476 It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly.
2477 I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything.
2478 I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot.
2479 I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good.
2480 But the post office and Sears also used to be the king!
2481 I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.
2482 Excellent burger
2483 Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time...
2484 It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy...
2485 I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot...
2486 Free!!
2487 I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..
2488 I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot!
2489 I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery.
2490 We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread.
2491 We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow.
2492 Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case.
2493 My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it.
2494 This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person.
2495 The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful.
2496 I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint.
2497 I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash.
2498 Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast.
2499 The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect.
2500 Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill.
2501 We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.
2502 It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite.
2503 Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more.
2504 I saw this place on a Food Network series in November.
2505 When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here.
2506 It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car.
2507 It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway.
2508 When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods.
2509 I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo.
2510 The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good.
2511 The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me.
2512 This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips.
2513 I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.
2514 I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.
2515 Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?
2516 I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.
2517 I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.
2518 How disappointing and dishonest.
2519 This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.
2520 My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years.
2521 After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!)
2522 so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)
2523 Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...).
2524 Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.
2525 Awesome!
2526 We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions.
2527 Back to the shop it went.
2528 Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things.
2529 At one point, they called and said "We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day."
2530 I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.
2531 We picked it up Tuesday.
2532 The bill?
2533 $7.
2534 That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS.
2535 They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter.
2536 That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.
2537 The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time.
2538 I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week.
2539 I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!
2540 I've rented from Captain Ted many times, and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River.
2541 He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here.
2542 Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!
2543 Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made.
2544 There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from.
2545 Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now.
2546      I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research.
2547 The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try.
2548 It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus.
2549 But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant.
2550 Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu.
2551 We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us.
2552 The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara.
2553 They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh.
2554 Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds.
2555 Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu.
2556 Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99).
2557 Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone.
2558 It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches.
2559 Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less).
2560 He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99).
2561 Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.
2562      Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets.
2563 It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure.
2564 The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.
2565 The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them.
2566 Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement.
2567 At any rate, they disappeared quickly.
2568 Unlike the sandwiches.
2569 They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home.
2570 The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll.
2571 The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top.
2572 Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste.
2573 There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening.
2574 It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve.
2575      Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza
2576 Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce.
2577 And lots more.
2578 I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!
2579 not clean, worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.
2580 Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.
2581 They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.
2582 Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).
2583 They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.
2584 Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.
2585 Pedicure okay.
2586 Won't come back.
2587 This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.
2588 They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.
2589 They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.
2590 How about healthy nails and return visit.
2591 This place I'm surprised stays in business.
2592 Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.
2593 Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.
2594 The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.
2595 No thank you.
2596 I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall.
2597 I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month.
2598 I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day!
2599 Always quick and fresh.
2600 I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?).
2601 It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it.
2602 I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!
2603 It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon.
2604 It is quality stuff.
2605 If you want something better fly to Italy.
2606 Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try!
2607 They are at the market for food truck fridays also.
2608 Check out their website for their usual schedule.
2609 They can take cash or credit (with square).
2610 I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend).
2611 They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants.
2612 They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint.
2613 Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.
2614 Bad customer service!
2615 No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.
2616 Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number, phone just kept ringing and ringing.
2617 :(
2618 What's with the cheese?
2619 It isn't even Velveta.
2620 It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.
2621 $5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.
2622 This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.
2623 McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump.
2624 what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels?
2625 i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.
2626 (sorry phx.)
2627 I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team.
2628 it was downright magical.
2629 the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge.
2630 the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc!
2631 yaaaaay!
2632 (why don't more hotels do this?)
2633 the pool was phenomenal.
2634 i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks.
2635 the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust.
2636 The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus.
2637 (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)
2638 If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough.
2639 Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles.
2640 Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party.
2641 Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service.
2642 Really, you can't go wrong with either.
2643 What is it about Phoenix hotels???
2644 all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!
2645 This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot.
2646 Pho-real!
2647 Impeccable service and the freshest food.
2648 Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable.
2649 The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was.
2650 Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.
2651 CASH ONLY!
2652 But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.
2653 So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.
2654 The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.
2655 Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.
2656 The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.
2657 The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.
2658 Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.
2659 The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.
2660 I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.
2661 The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.
2662 Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.
2663 Had a late night plumbing emergency last night.
2664 Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing.
2665 Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem.
2666 At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers, toilets being flushed, and my wife was talking to me again.
2667 Sounds great right?
2668 Get's even better!
2669 The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever.
2670 Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy.
2671 Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.
2672 On another note...
2673 I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long.
2674 They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew.
2675 Thanks Parker & Son's.
2676 The best fish tacos, period!
2677 And I hate chain restaurants!
2678 This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley!
2679 Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent!
2680 My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had.
2681 Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots!
2682 Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day.
2683 Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees!
2684 One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10.
2685 Bummer but still the best!
2686 After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor.
2687 Quite a contrast to my first visit.
2688 Still enjoyed the meal, but wasn't as impressed with the chicken.
2689 I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke.
2690 I would be beside myself if Grinders closed.
2691 It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular.
2692 I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.
2693 I'm the one who brought the plants in.
2694 I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted.
2695 I should get on that ...
2696 The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order.
2697 Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla.
2698 I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings.
2699 Now I get it on multigrain toast.
2700 Eh, it's the little things.
2701 The coffee at Grinders is really really good.
2702 It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth.
2703 They grind their beans outside many mornings per week.
2704 Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.
2705 There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table.
2706 They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together.
2707 They call themselves the Geezerados.
2708 There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day.
2709 One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church.
2710 They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.
2711 A lot of moms come in with their kids.
2712 Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common.
2713 There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day.
2714 I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.
2715 Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids.
2716 They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd.
2717 They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes.
2718 Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep.
2719 I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know.
2720 I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it.
2721 For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.
2722 There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto.
2723 It has character.
2724 Some months the art is better than other months.
2725 Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever.
2726 I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye.
2727 That's the beauty of Grinders.
2728 I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too.
2729 It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.
2730 Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too.
2731 It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs.
2732 I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did.
2733 I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there.
2734 LAME!
2735 In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.
2736 My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.
2737 The service is the best just like their steaks.
2738 I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.
2739 We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.
2740 We have been here many times in the last 10+ years.
2741 The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had.
2742 The combination of sweet, crunchy, savory and acidic is perfect to me.
2743 Lately, I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto.
2744 The scallops are great, but the risotto just doesn't work, though I love beets and I love risotto.
2745 I have, of course, had the mushroom stir fry, which is very good but very hearty and heavy.
2746 Soups have been excellent.
2747 The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie.
2748 But beware...it is really rich and sweet.
2749 I also enjoy the wine flights here.
2750 Most recently, I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch.
2751 Though they were the only kids there, they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers.
2752 This is still my favorite place in Old Town.
2753 This place literally just opened.
2754 I didn't really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth.
2755 This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground.
2756 They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.
2757 I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S.
2758 I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !
2759 !Yay plants:)
2760 FnB is how every restaurant should be.
2761 Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic, who runs the place, cannot be at every restaurant.
2762 This is a small, friendly restaurant in my hood, that just happens to have some of the best food you will find.
2763 I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff.
2764 I've come here with friends, but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome.
2765 I like sitting up at the counter, and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there.
2766 Pavle & his wife run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.
2767 Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish.
2768 My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu.
2769 I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often.
2770 In conclusion, fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood.
2771 :)
2772 I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!
2773 If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.
2774 I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.
2775 If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.
2776 It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.
2777 Pros -
2778 1.
2779 Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.
2780 Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.
2781 They encourage you to come in.
2782 2.
2783 They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.
2784 So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.
2785 You can't beat that deal.
2786 3.
2787 I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.
2788 4.
2789 Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.
2790 Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.
2791 That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!
2792 5.
2793 They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.
2794 Kristen is who I go to and she is great.
2795 I have been to almost all their girls and they are good.
2796 6.
2797 In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.
2798 7.
2799 They always have deals.
2800 Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!!
2801 That is so cheap.
2802 They let you buy up to 3 sessions.
2803 I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.
2804 8.
2805 I love Laser for Less, CHANDLER!!
2806 !
2807 Cons - never having to shave again, darn.
2808 Excellent service and food.
2809 Best tex-mex in the valley.
2810 The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service.
2811 It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....
2812 I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.
2813 Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states "the manager is off till next week."
2814 i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard
2815 This store has the most pleasant employees of any Forever 21 I have ever been to.
2816 The girls are always smiling and they take the time to esquire if you need help.
2817 The other day, I went in and an employee spent over 10 minutes helping me locate a particular skirt my sister wanted for Christmas.
2818 I love cupcakes.
2819 Its true.
2820 I really do.
2821 I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze.
2822 That said, if there is a good cupcake to be had, I'm on my way to experience it.
2823 I must note- that I am not a fan of Sprinkles; as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped.
2824 We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays (its a tradition we do once a month from baker's around town).
2825 Because of my love for all thinks coffee- I got the Carmel Mocchiato.
2826 Let me just say- i wished I took a picture.
2827 But I couldn't help but to dive in.
2828 Mocha Buttercream frosting-piled high, crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle.
2829 I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet.
2830 The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop (because I love lemon).
2831 I'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops.
2832 This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write.
2833 I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.
2834 I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink.
2835 I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.
2836 We are both big sushi enthusiasts.
2837 The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.
2838 Well appointed.
2839 The service was excellent.
2840 We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.
2841 Not much you can do to mess that up.
2842 Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.
2843 Ordered five different sushi rolls.
2844 All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.
2845 The fish was not fresh.
2846 Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.
2847 Will not go back.
2848 Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.
2849 My daughter says to give it another try.
2850 We'll see...
2851 I'll let you know if I do.
2852 I love this place!
2853 Everything about it!
2854 The great food, the grocery section, the cramped seating (it gives character).
2855 It all goes together perfectly.
2856 Haven't found one bad thing yet:)
2857 35 minutes... No food.
2858 You be the judge.
2859 Best Chinese food in the Valley.
2860 As others have said, salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers.
2861 Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large, plump high quality pieces of shrimp.
2862 I have never had even an average dish here.
2863 Go and enjoy!
2864 Here's the deal.
2865 I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot.
2866 My friend was right.
2867 Everything I had a problem with before was remedied.
2868 I went in unannounced, didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service I've received in town.
2869 When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit.
2870 No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff.
2871 The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly.
2872 Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc.
2873 The decor has been refreshed, and although I didn't dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well.
2874 Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before.
2875 Props to the new management.
2876 Well done.
2877 I'll be back.
2878 PS - forgot to order side syrup.
2879 Curious to see if they still charge $2.
2880 I am not a fan of this place.
2881 I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial "positive sandwich"
2882 Top Bun: The location is fantastic.
2883 I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.
2884 The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd.
2885 I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures.
2886 As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world.
2887 I didn't care for this place.
2888 I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray.
2889 It wasn't good.
2890 The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless.
2891 I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it.
2892 Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good.
2893 I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part.
2894 The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something.
2895 There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.)
2896 it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd.
2897 The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad.
2898 there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes.
2899 Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes
2900 Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly.
2901 The cooks were also friendly.
2902 I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place.
2903 I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place.
2904 I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client.
2905 I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things.
2906 I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.
2907 If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.
2908 The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second.
2909 Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only.
2910 Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.
2911 The service is OK.
2912 They have a couple of generic draft beers.
2913 Everything is overpriced.
2914 Caveat Emptor if you order an entree.
2915 This was absolutely horrible.
2916 I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.
2917 I threw it in the trash.
2918 I will wait until I get to my destination to eat.
2919 Horrible!!
2920 !
2921 Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!!
2922 All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.
2923 Yeah...notsomuch.
2924 Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait .
2925 Or the chaos.
2926 Or the hype.
2927 Or the attitude from the morons who work there.
2928 Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...
2929 - The cupcakes are not that great.
2930 I ordered two.
2931 The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.
2932 - This place is a disorganized mess.
2933 - There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process.
2934 My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes.
2935 Just stupid.
2936 - The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions.
2937 No sane person could possibly work here without being like "um...there might be a better way to do this..."
2938 - Also, the employees were rude.
2939 Did I mention dumb?
2940 So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water.
2941 I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty.
2942 The idiot at the counter told me "You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it."
2943 I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register.
2944 Couldn't she just sell me a water?
2945 She said "NO" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word "water") on a cupcake order slip.
2946 She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.
2947 I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!"
2948 I said "It's quite simple.
2949 Just hand me the water and I will hand you money.
2950 End of discussion."
2951 (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)
2952 She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4" 110 lbs of fury.
2953 Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her.
2954 Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone.
2955 I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion.
2956 And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo.
2957 The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down!!
2958 A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids!!
2959 The owners are always around to ensure ur experience!!
2960 TV's everywhere, if you love sports and beer this is the place for you!!
2961 The nob has events all week and food specials to go along... the ribs are amazing!!
2962 however the GYRO is good as it gets!!
2963 The best gyro in the valley you can write that one down!!
2964 and the wings... once you pop u just cant stop!
2965 !
2966 HOB NOB SPORTS BAR & GRILL cheers to you!
2967 !
2968 Beautiful restaurant!
2969 Terrrific service!
2970 Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!
2971 I've always been treated well @ D'ambrosio's despite my not exactly being 'N Scottsdale plastic'.
2972 :)
2973 Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop!
2974 The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous!
2975 The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist.
2976 Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.
2977 Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?
2978 They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.
2979 I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!
2980 Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.
2981 It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!
2982 Even though I've rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus, I highly recommend this little greek hot spot.
2983 They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back.
2984 The hummus is to die for (it only comes with one pita however, so I always order 2-3 extra).
2985 I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great.
2986 I have brought many meat-loving friends here and I've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food.
2987 The staff is completely Greek.
2988 They are friendly in their own unique kind of way.
2989 Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB.
2990 I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there).
2991 I love her personality...very intense.
2992 Never smiles, even when a smile would be just right.
2993 But she is still very kind.
2994 Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food.
2995 I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm.
2996 Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty.
2997 We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious).
2998 Service was friendly and attentive.
2999 The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.
3000 My husband and I enjoyed a "staycation" here for my birthday.
3001 We had an amazing time!
3002 We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar.
3003 The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table.
3004 They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is $5.
3005 Excellent hamburgers and margaritas.
3006 We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde.
3007 We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility.
3008 The staff was amazing and very accommodating.
3009 They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends.
3010 Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness.
3011 If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else.
3012 My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful.
3013 I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine!
3014 I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls.
3015 They were all really good.
3016 The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price.
3017 I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet.
3018 The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing.
3019 This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying.
3020 Just perfect !!!
3021 For what it is!!!
3022 Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!
3023 !
3024 It's a beautiful day.
3025 Clear sky and around 65 degrees in the late morning!
3026 What to do?
3027 My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels.
3028 Woo-hoo!
3029 Is he ready to go on a dirt trail?
3030 We're gearing him up to go mountain biking up North.
3031 Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve.
3032 It was an excellent choice.
3033 "This is awesome!"
3034 my little one exclaimed, as he bounced up and down on the trail.
3035 Then, he'll just stop right in front of me without warning.
3036 Five year olds get distracted so easily.
3037 "Is that a wasp?
3038 Look at that hover fly!
3039 What kind of ant is that?
3040 What kind of beetles live here!"
3041 asks my little future entomologist.
3042 We'll be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon!
3043 My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths.
3044 He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit.
3045 Such a sport!
3046 "Let's come back here again.,  That was fun!"
3047 It was fun for us too!
3048 We're so lucky we live not far from here.
3049 It is a very well maintained park.
3050 As it gets hotter, we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library.
3051 I highly recommend you check this place out.
3052 The Thai menu is totally amazing!
3053 I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.
3054 I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.
3055 Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did.
3056 They have a lunch menu as well.
3057 I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review.
3058 tasteless and awful
3059 Tiffany @ the chanel counter.
3060 Tana in the lingerie department.
3061 these are my go-to girls for everything.
3062 i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else.
3063 except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room.
3064 but everything else: make up, accessories, clothes....all to one of these girls.
3065 i recommend you only work with them as well :)
3066 Yeah it was good.
3067 My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly "side dish" function.
3068 The food was all fantastic.
3069 All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.
3070 I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.
3071 Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool.
3072 Outdoor area is excellent.
3073 Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said "he" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.
3074 Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.
3075 Why is that guy walking directly toward me?
3076 Oh, it's me.
3077 In the mirror.
3078 Dumbass.
3079 So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says "yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"
3080 so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.
3081 Fun night.
3082 I love this place!
3083 I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering.
3084 Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich.
3085 You won't regret it!
3086 Ice Ice Baby...
3087 Ice Ice Baby...
3088 All right stop collaborate and listen;
3089 Ice Now is here and it's got my attention
3090 Make some drinks - not warm but frosty;
3091 And believe me when I say they are not costly
3092 Will it ever melt?
3093 yo I don't know.
3094 Give them a call and they'll show
3095 To the extreme I yelp like a sandal;
3096 Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle
3097 ... Ice ice baby
3098 PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!
3099 This is the best I can do for now...
3100 Need ice for an event?
3101 Call Ice Now!
3102 They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.
3103 And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!
3104 I love Dr.
3105 Scott!!
3106 He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too!
3107 Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible.
3108 The massage therapists rock too!
3109 I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
3110 Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo.
3111 This store has everything!
3112 The employees are also very knowledgeable.
3113 The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change).
3114 So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec.
3115 The Malbec tasted amazing!
3116 I was so happy.
3117 For those of you who don't know, it's not only wine!
3118 You can find everything else.
3119 Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests.
3120 Also, don't forget to chill your bottles before you leave!
3121 Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.
3122 I was really surprised at how great it is.
3123 Wow.
3124 Been there 2 times.
3125 I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.
3126 I'm from NW Indiana originally.
3127 I know corn.
3128 Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.
3129 This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.
3130 There has to be crack in there...
3131 I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.
3132 I need that corn... it's just so good.
3133 I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.
3134 Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.
3135 They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn....
3136 I know where I'm going tonight.
3137 Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business!
3138 Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget!
3139 Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for.
3140 I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side.
3141 The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate.
3142 My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice.
3143 Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium.
3144 All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!
3145 Woo Hoo!
3146 Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!
3147 Yummy pizza.
3148 Covet is an excellent clothing store.
3149 In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop.
3150 unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you.
3151 Acne Jeans?
3152 check.
3153 Endovenera?
3154 check.
3155 Ksubi?
3156 check.
3157 Nike?
3158 check.
3159 Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section,
3160 continues with an excellent men's clothing selection,
3161 and finishes off with excellent women's wear.
3162 It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet.
3163 Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.
3164 Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing.
3165 So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience.
3166 Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 .
3167 I'm not in a good mood.
3168 Texas cheese fries.
3169 Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon.
3170 Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had.
3171 Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it.
3172 Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.
3173 Kid's meal.
3174 Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun.
3175 No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.
3176 By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met.
3177 Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!
3178 Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star.
3179 Should have walked out, didn't.
3180 :(
3181 Entrees.
3182 Cajun steak .
3183 Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find.
3184 They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it.
3185 Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:)
3186 Sirloin steak.
3187 Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned.
3188 Sides: Twice baked potato.
3189 If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you.
3190 You want an idea of what it's texture was?
3191 Twice chewed would be a better name.
3192 Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.
3193 Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected.
3194 They looked very consistent though,  canned?
3195 Never mind they were edible:
3196 Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.
3197 Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.
3198 ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)
3199 1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.
3200 When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money.
3201 I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class.
3202 Soooo good!
3203  I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese.
3204 The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.
3205 I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3.
3206 I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.
3207 The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner?
3208 manager on duty maybe?)
3209 if she would let me use my card.
3210 She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said "No" and returned to what she was doing.
3211 No apology, no "I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...." Very curt.
3212 Thanks a lot personality plus!
3213 I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball.
3214 Shame too, I loved those bagels.
3215 Love, love, love!
3216 Service is always fabulous and every dish has been perfect.
3217 The local cheese plate and AZ wine selections are amazing.
3218 I think between the 5 of us we have had everything on the menu, and it was all delicious.
3219 This is my fave place in the country right now.
3220 Can't wait to go back over the holidays!
3221 This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting.
3222 Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce.
3223 But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me
3224 First off, the restaurant is dim and dark..
3225 I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain.
3226 The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at.
3227 The service sucked ass.
3228 I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...?
3229 Are you that lazy.
3230 Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side.
3231 Pho had a rancid smell.
3232 Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY.
3233 My husband and I have been going here for a few years now.
3234 It is one of our favorite places.
3235 Really low key, affordable, amazing food!
3236 Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed!
3237 I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!
3238 I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.
3239 Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.
3240 My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.
3241 I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.
3242 We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.
3243 It was all so delicious!
3244 I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.
3245 Again, it was very tasty!
3246  Everyone was very friendly and prompt.
3247 I will be back to Upper Crust!
3248 Yes it is bad for you.
3249 Yes it is delicious.
3250 Great customer service.
3251 Clean, fast and predictable.
3252 I love pita Jungle!
3253 Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here.
3254 The food is fresh and healthy(ish).
3255 There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious.
3256 I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.
3257 I love the girls there.
3258 I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can.
3259 Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it.
3260 I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it.
3261 I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately.
3262 No goof ups!
3263 Plus, they don't chip.
3264 The lady said they'd last around two weeks.
3265 I'm so happy with them.
3266 It's been a week and they still look pretty good.
3267 :)
3268 An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix, we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.
3269 They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.
3270 One year we did an annual pass.
3271 It was a good deal.
3272 There are also lots of special events that include deals.
3273 One time we met spiderman.
3274 There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.
3275 Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.
3276 There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.
3277 Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.
3278 The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.
3279 The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.
3280 There isn't much shade, so be prepared.
3281 All of the staff are really nice.
3282 There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.
3283 All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.
3284 Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.
3285 Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant.
3286 We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal.
3287 Gyro combo this trip.
3288 Meat was very flavorful and great texture.
3289 Tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've tasted.
3290 Sushi ken I love you so much, I don't even know where to start!
3291 It's about time I write a review.
3292 This place in my opinion is the best quality for largest portion size in the valley.
3293   Let me just say now that if are one those people  who A.
3294 Like California rolls B. like spicy whatever rolls C. Want to go somewhere trendy and have sake bombers then this is NOT the place for you, please just don't come and spare me your stupid review, just go to Ra or Stingray or somewhere like that.
3295 My husband and I eat here a least every couple of weeks, I feel like the staff is our family.
3296 They are very nice and polite.
3297 A lot of families here, restaurant is decorated simply.
3298 Nigeri and sashimi are very good.
3299 UNI here is amazing!
3300 Yellow tail belly is awesome also love the seaweed salad.
3301 From the regular menu I love the yellow tail Kama and the cold soba bowl.
3302 I also really like that they are open 7 days a week pretty late since most places in AZ close at like 9.
3303 Best BBQ ever.
3304 Go here and thank me later.
3305 We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com.
3306 They couldn't pay us to go back.
3307 If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot.
3308 There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta.
3309 In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often.
3310 For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions.
3311 The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.
3312 The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating.
3313 Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits.
3314 I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.
3315 There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down.
3316 I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio.
3317 It was very clean and the people were friendly.
3318 I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me.
3319 I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.
3320 Evil Place!!
3321 !
3322 That's right..
3323 I walked in there and I couldnt believe it.
3324 The people were nice to me, asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day, i had a new kitten!
3325 All joking aisde, I love this place.
3326 I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores, but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart.
3327 The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out.
3328 To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing.
3329 The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food, they remembered which kitten we got.
3330 Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted.
3331 You want good service and a great place for your pets.. Petsmart is the best!
3332 I love guerrero's!
3333 I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time.
3334 I'm a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.
3335 It's a husband and wife team that runs it.
3336 The best thing are the beans - incidentally, that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).
3337 Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border.
3338 I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa!
3339 Yum!
3340 I love the Superstition Mountains!
3341 It is the most convenient place to get away from it all.
3342 The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron.
3343 There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness.
3344 Camping sites fill up fast here, so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive.
3345 I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places I've tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!
3346 I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.
3347 The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.
3348 We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.
3349 They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!
3350 Everything was excellent.
3351 The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.
3352 They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.
3353 Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.
3354 The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.
3355 The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.
3356 I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.
3357 Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!
3358 That double-won me over.
3359 I want Bobby Q right now.
3360 I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.
3361 I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.
3362 My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!
3363 The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.
3364 I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.
3365 It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.
3366 Great neighborhood pizza place!
3367 Rarely crowded.
3368 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors.
3369 Wifi is usually fast.
3370 Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular.
3371 But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?
3372 Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar.
3373 Great time and the scene was fantastic.
3374 Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables.
3375 I've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch.
3376 Always ensure that the experience is better than expected.
3377 I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try, haha!
3378 Um, don't come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in).
3379 It is VERY easy to get lost!
3380 There are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better.
3381 So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH!
3382 AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom!
3383 This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight.
3384 You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there!
3385 If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights.
3386 Plus, it's GORGEOUS!
3387 (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down)
3388 Don't forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)
3389 When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet, I wasn't at all apprehensive.
3390 My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine.
3391 She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled.
3392 Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi.
3393 No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site.
3394 You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile.
3395 Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs.
3396 Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price.
3397 Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay.
3398 If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.
3399 LOVE Chino Bandido.
3400 The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.
3401 Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot.
3402 I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across.
3403 It's practically a hobby for me.
3404 For YEARS I kept saying, "I want to go to Cowboy Ciao" but we never made it.
3405 Then, thankfully, the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go.
3406 (Thank you hubs' best friend!)
3407 I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming.
3408 There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasn't about to miss out.
3409 The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank.
3410 The chopped salad has earned its reputation.
3411 That thing is de-freaking-licious.
3412 The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was!
3413 AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty.
3414 Seriously, can it get any better?
3415 For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)
3416 I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!
3417 The facility is a bit dated, but the service is great.
3418 Dr. Rios is patient and thorough, and his staff are friendly and efficient.
3419 Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.
3420 Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?
3421 They're great.
3422 Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly .
3423 I had pollo erbe, terrific.
3424  " wine tasting director" very good, with tasty selections.
3425 Will be back, OFTEN.
3426 Highly recommend.
3427 Rich D
3428 Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.
3429 Amazing service and warranty on tires.
3430 Thank you!
3431 I can't think of a better Thai rest.
3432 In PHX.
3433 Consistently good food and service.
3434 They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls, Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish.
3435 Average Thai food pricing, free parking.
3436 There are a good number of tables, so don't let a short line dissuade you.
3437 Like any rest., scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood.
3438 Boisterous din in the main room when busy.
3439 Avoid at all costs.
3440 Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.
3441 Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.
3442 BLECH.
3443 The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks.
3444 Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.
3445 The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy.
3446 And the screen is huge.
3447 This is my new favorite movie theatre.
3448 Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos.
3449 You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime, so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time, with some wine.
3450 This is where postino's comes in.
3451 The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps.
3452 There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance.
3453 Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.
3454 Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.
3455 We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus.
3456 The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be.
3457 The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.
3458 For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.
3459 We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta.
3460 Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.
3461 For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.
3462 Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs.
3463 They also have a play place, which is pretty cool.
3464 I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing.
3465 Fantastic service as well.
3466 I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile.
3467 Very polite staff, and delicious food.... what more could one ask for?
3468 I totally wish Chick-fil-A would sell thier Chick-fil-A sauce by the bottle cuz it's sooo good
3469 Just because i feel like doing something different.
3470 :P
3471 i'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...
3472 Truth is here the truth is here
3473 Truth is here the truth is here
3474 Truth is here the truth is here
3475 I said the truth is here the truth is here
3476 I want more
3477 Give me more
3478 We want more
3479 God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
3480 We want more
3481 I want more and more and more
3482 I want more
3483 We need more
3484 I want more
3485 God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
3486 Give me more
3487 I want more and more and more
3488 [Verse 1:]
3489 I stand here naked as the day I was born
3490 Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
3491 Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
3492 And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
3493 I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
3494 Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
3495 Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
3496 It's got to be allowed to breathe
3497 Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
3498 I want more than what your offering me
3499 Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
3500 I'm a rebel in my own right
3501 Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
3502 When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
3503 Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be
3504 [Chorus: x2]
3505 I want more
3506 We need more
3507 I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more
3508 Give me more
3509 I want more and more and more
3510 I said the truth is here the truth is here
3511 Truth is here the truth is here
3512 Truth is here the truth is here
3513 Truth is here the truth is
3514 [Verse 2:]
3515 Not nearly a single solitary soul
3516 Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
3517 One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
3518 Until then the big man is gold
3519 Got one lone reason to go on breathing
3520 Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
3521 Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
3522 The people need to see them pure human being
3523 Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
3524 Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
3525 Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
3526 Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
3527 We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
3528 Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
3529 Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe
3530 [Chorus x2]
3531 [Verse 3:]
3532 Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
3533 Not bought and sold, not all controlled
3534 Bring a little fire when the world get cold
3535 Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
3536 People need more freedom
3537 Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
3538 Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
3539 Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
3540 I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
3541 Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
3542 I demand you start listening to the crowd
3543 If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground
3544 [Chorus x2]
3545 I said the truth is here the truth is here
3546 Truth is here the truth is here
3547 Truth is here the truth is here
3548 Truth is here the truth is
3549 the atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!
3550 One of my favorite brunch spots.
3551 Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.
3552 There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.
3553 I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.
3554 I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.
3555 Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver.
3556 Seriously.
3557 I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much.
3558 If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day.
3559 Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.
3560 My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.
3561 In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.
3562 Decent prices, giant selection.
3563 One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.
3564 If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.
3565 Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....
3566 I live in two cities in two different states and travel back and forth each month.
3567 I tend to use services where I find them and haven't really found a  really great barbershop in the last three years.
3568 While I was in Anthem this week, I decided to give Vs Barbershop at Happy Valley Road a try.
3569 I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist, but I was pleasantly surprised this time.
3570 I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.
3571 I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.
3572 I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.
3573 My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style.
3574 I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill.
3575 Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day.
3576 The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.
3577 Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service.
3578 This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.
3579 If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head, please give Vs a try.
3580 By the way, it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra.
3581 Awesome place!!
3582 EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)!
3583 Ask for Dizzy Dre, he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!!
3584 Very patient with women!!
3585 ;)
3586 I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time.
3587 I would never ever go back there.
3588 The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad.
3589 The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions.
3590 To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone .
3591 So rude and bad customer service.
3592 It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!
3593 !
3594 Do not bother going anywhere else.
3595 This is the place to go for laser.
3596 No contracts, easy to get appointments, very reasonable.
3597 The staff is fantastic, every one of them.
3598 I usually go to Kristen, but all others are as equally friendly and competent.
3599 Location is very convenient also.
3600 I have looked, and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places, but I never bothered.
3601 This is the one.
3602 I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food.
3603 My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken.
3604 I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts.
3605 The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal.
3606 Go there.
3607 This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona.
3608 I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson!
3609 The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows!
3610 The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate!
3611 I always order pho Tai and water..
3612 But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent!
3613 I love the broth!
3614 It's true pho broth..
3615 It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference!
3616 The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen!
3617 I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
3618 I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.
3619 Good thing I didn't.
3620 The food is as awesome as ever.
3621 The service is much as it has always been.
3622 Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you.
3623 The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's.
3624 If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that.
3625 Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food.
3626 If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.
3627 When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit.
3628 There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day.
3629 This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it.
3630 In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen.
3631 If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes.
3632 I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers.
3633 I'd just come back on another day.
3634 To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below.
3635 I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe.
3636 They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations.
3637 Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.
3638 I love this place and hope I always will.
3639 I am DONE with Classic Car Spa, their sub-par car washes, and their shady business partnerships.
3640 Whatever you do, DO NOT get your windshield replaced by the Auto Glass Shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises.
3641 I am holding Classic Car Spa accountable for placing their customers in such close proximity to criminals.
3642 While these Auto Glass Shop men are friendly and seem helpful, it is a scam.
3643 They replaced my windshield (and hey, it cost me nothing b/c my insurance covers it) and put the glass in wrong THREE TIMES!
3644 After one week and many HOURS on the phone with them and my insurance company, they are still giving me the run around.
3645 So although it was free, I will now have to foot the bill for fixing their crappy craftsmanship.
3646 After trying in vain to get my windshield fixed by the Auto Glass Shop, I spoke with the manager of Classic Car Spa.
3647 I don't think I've ever met a manager with a more relaxed, "who cares?"
3648 attitude.
3649 That place is a joke.
3650 Except, I'm not laughing....
3651 Don't waste your time...Arrowhead mall on the other side of town is so much better!
3652 I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings.
3653 What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.
3654 I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche.
3655 After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter.
3656 When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche.
3657 I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right.
3658 The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them.
3659 Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold.
3660 So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, "well we don't have anymore of that one."
3661 Thanks.
3662 I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche.
3663 She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense.
3664 I'm over you being cooler than me, but I'm not over you having no soul.
3665 Best happy hour on this side of town.
3666 The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt.
3667 I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here.
3668 I only go in if Jennifer is working though!
3669 The bar has plenty of TVs too.
3670 I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place.
3671 The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong.
3672 The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends.
3673 The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale.
3674 Last night I was wowed by Mabel's.
3675 We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause.
3676 The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life.
3677 Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.
3678 Great place for Italian food.
3679 Very family friendly.
3680 Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff.
3681 Never had a bad meal.
3682 My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge.
3683 Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
3684 Hey Thai Elephant!
3685 Stop sucking!
3686 You used to be so good.
3687 Why is my egg roll cold?
3688 Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!?
3689 Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?...
3690 AND it's on the menu!
3691 When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost?
3692 When did your service start sucking?
3693 Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend!
3694 Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink?
3695 By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu.
3696 If you are not going to actually offer it, then you need to take it off your menu.
3697 I can't believe it's come to this...
3698 I used to love you.
3699 You broke my heart for the last time.
3700 I never write these things.
3701 But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty.
3702 Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients.
3703 I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season.
3704 Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub.
3705 It is for certain served in heaven.
3706 That is all.
3707 P.S.
3708 check out the hours, yo.
3709 You know what's up.
3710 I almost wish I hadn't discovered this place because it's so good!
3711 Ton's of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting)
3712 So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldn't have been nicer.
3713 Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets.
3714 I've loved every single flavor I've had there (peanut butter, brownie swirl, mint chip, salted butter caramel, mayan chocolate, and more).
3715 Everything is made from all natural, fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts, fresh mint leaves, etc).
3716 When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae, you get to pick two flavors of icecream, a sauce, and a topping.
3717 If you haven't been to Sweet Republic, go!
3718 If you're far from Shea & 101, find them at First Fridays downtown, farmers markets, and more.
3719 I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience.
3720 The service was snobby and rude.
3721 The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices.
3722 I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos.
3723 The service is clearly substandard and snobby.
3724 False ads, do not stay there.
3725 Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel.
3726 The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray.
3727 The place is run down and poorly serviced.
3728 The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of.
3729 I stayed on the fifth floor "cabana suites" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place.
3730 The "suites" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room.
3731 The pool was NASTY!
3732 (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an "out of order" sign placed at the entrance.
3733 This place was embarrassing!
3734 I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!
3735 This was our first time at Texas BBQ House.
3736 They gave us a sample and help us with our order.
3737 The brisket was fantastic.
3738 I got the moist and my wife got the lean.
3739 We both enjoyed our choices immensely.
3740 I will definitely go back.
3741 I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.
3742 My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?
3743 You get what you pay for.
3744 We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.
3745 (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)
3746 Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.
3747 My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!
3748 For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.
3749 The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!
3750 For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.
3751 I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.
3752 I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said "we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it"....what??
3753 the dishes are made to order??
3754 I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!
3755 After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.
3756 They were HEAVENLY!
3757 So many flavors and so fresh!
3758 !
3759 Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.
3760 The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.
3761 Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.
3762 Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.
3763 No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile.
3764 A coworker recommended this place to me.
3765 Actually, two coworkers did.
3766 However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.
3767 Yes, mold.
3768 Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie.
3769 I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.
3770 Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.
3771 *ETA
3772 MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95.
3773 I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.
3774 I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses.
3775 It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic!
3776 We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders.
3777 I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful!
3778 the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet.
3779 The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.
3780 My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good.
3781 They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty.
3782 It's definitely rich and gooey.
3783 I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too!
3784 Amazing place.
3785 This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.
3786 My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I don't believe that anymore).
3787 I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.
3788 It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.
3789 A perfect activity for a half-day of school!
3790 Hooray creativity and uniqueness!
3791 Food poisoning alert.
3792 There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment.
3793 First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy.
3794    Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started.
3795 Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended.
3796 Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins.
3797 This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally).
3798 Go here to drink and stay away from all food.
3799 Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins.
3800 Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches.
3801 It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene.
3802 Bad choice.
3803 Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price.
3804 The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.
3805 I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for.
3806 I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback.
3807 I asked if they might have any additional copies.
3808 The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel.
3809 I was so thrilled to have found the books!
3810 I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1.
3811 I won't be in town for it but if anyone is, I recommend checking it out!
3812 OK, so this is how much I love this product.
3813 I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again.
3814 When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth.
3815 "Is Lee's gonna be there?"
3816 ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner.
3817 I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now.
3818 The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover.
3819 I will have to visit the shop soon.
3820 If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out!
3821 They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world.
3822 They have herbal, rooibos, green, black, and white teas.
3823 The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there.
3824 They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive.
3825 Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN.
3826 The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from.
3827 Hear my teapot whistling......gotta go!
3828 I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.
3829 I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.
3830 Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc.
3831 is great.
3832 It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.
3833 Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10.
3834 HELLO!
3835 We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.
3836   Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.
3837 You will be glad you did.
3838 Yummy.
3839 Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way.
3840 I often say, "I need to stop there."
3841 Today I did.
3842 It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items.
3843 From baby, wedding, kitchen and on!
3844 I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands!
3845 LOVE!!
3846 !
3847 Not worth the money.
3848 Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
3849 I love me some Dobson Ranch.
3850 As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned, this is as good as it gets (Aguila is a close second).
3851 No overbearing marshalls.
3852 Rates that top out at $28 in the winter.
3853 Above average range and practice area, including two large putting greens.
3854 Cheap pitchers of beer.
3855 A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!
3856 As far as the course itself, this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti, only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.
3857 But there are birdies to be had, and lots of them; #1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).
3858 The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda, not some hybrid or bent grass, so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.
3859 #5 is my favorite hole, a short-par 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway, leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.
3860 #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice, as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time, as your ball will face a watery grave.
3861 #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.
3862 And finally, #18, a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.
3863 A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length), there are some low scores out there.
3864 A great course, value, practice area, and recently renovated restaurant and bar - 5 stars.
3865 Mouth watering.
3866 That's all I have to say.
3867 The food at this place is seriously amazing.
3868 Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal.
3869 The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort).
3870 It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost!
3871 We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.
3872 The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale.
3873 I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night.
3874 It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though).
3875 IKEA is so much fun.
3876 It's a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs, couches, beds.
3877 I love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home.
3878 They have very good prices on all household items.
3879 When shopping for accessories for the house I highly recommend going to IKEA because you are bound to find something.
3880 Simple things such as Tupperware, trash cans, bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price.
3881 This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.
3882 Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual, but tasty and high quality.
3883 Gil's was all of these things.
3884 The food presentation is pretty without pretension.
3885 Everything was fantastic.
3886 Best of all, Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.
3887 Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis, taquitos, enchiladas and especially the chips.
3888 We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up - including Gil.
3889 They over delivered in every sense.
3890 Enjoyed the egg rolls.
3891 So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.
3892 The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.
3893 I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.
3894 Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.
3895 Very nice waitress.
3896 The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?
3897 A bit warmer than I would like inside.
3898 Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.
3899 My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time.
3900 I have nothing but good things to say.
3901 Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent.
3902 This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc.
3903 If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough.
3904 Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!
3905 We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening.
3906 I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.
3907 There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs.
3908 There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well.
3909 Talk about your one stop shopping.
3910 I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old.
3911 She was absolutly adorable.
3912 We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet.
3913 Nice and Clean all throughout the store .
3914 We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.
3915 Lots of Parking in the lot.
3916 Plus nice clean human bathrooms.
3917 A great family owned restaurant!
3918 Their lunch specials are very reasonable.
3919 I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food.
3920 My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
3921 Glad this place has new ownership...
3922 I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.
3923 You have been warned ;)

3925 Short Review:
3926 THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS
3927 Long Review:
3928 We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night.
3929 We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while.
3930 We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft...
3931 I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall.
3932 The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan.
3933 All hip-hop, all night.
3934 The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way!
3935 Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore.
3936 Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms.
3937 It was entertaining until it became annoying.
3938 Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!
3939 The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.
3940 A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one.
3941 Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a "sports cafe"?
3942 ?
3943 The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the "line" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out.
3944 No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.
3945 Oh!
3946 and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.
3947 The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.
3948 Weirdos!
3949 If any of this appeals to you this is your place!
3950 BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)
3951 My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch.
3952 We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way.
3953 I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind.
3954 I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches.
3955 It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.
3956 After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go.
3957 I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:
3958 1)I have only been to this place once.
3959 2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3960 3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.
3961 That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.
3962 About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place.
3963 The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.
3964 We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers.
3965 The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.
3966 All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar).
3967 Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.
3968 But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server.
3969 She said, "I can't imagine it will be much longer."
3970 I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.
3971 Where was the manager that day?
3972 Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?
3973 We left money on the table for our beers and walked out.
3974 I guess there is a first time for everything.
3975 As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.
3976 Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.
3977 A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.
3978 It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.
3979 The Service
3980 My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.
3981 The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.
3982 Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.
3983 A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.
3984 The Food
3985 We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two.
3986 And "Jumbo" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.
3987 Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.
3988 For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.
3989 My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.
3990 Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.
3991 I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.
3992 The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.
3993 After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.
3994 He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.
3995 The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.
3996 A nice finish to an excellent meal.
3997 Atmosphere
3998 We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.
3999 The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.
4000 I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.
4001 I Love this place.
4002 I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!
4003 I also agree with some of the others.
4004 I love the fact that I can try something new without committing!
4005 I love the revolving sushi.
4006 I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections.
4007 Why not offer the spice on the side.
4008 I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.
4009 Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:
4010 Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado!
4011 Hand rolls - YUM!!!
4012 Some are only 2.50
4013 Udon - Good!
4014 The staff is great.
4015 The wait can be long on some days or eves.
4016 Love the baked scallops.
4017 Great mussels too.
4018 Very nice neighborhood spot.
4019 The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.
4020 The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.
4021 I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.
4022 Wish there was 4.5 stars available for me to choose.
4023 Went here on a business trip with a coworker and tried it out.
4024 I had at least one of the following:
4025 Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?
4026 It was served very cold.
4027 Thumbs up.
4028 Green Tea - Good.
4029 Good service on the refills also.
4030 Edamame - Good.
4031 Right amount of salt.
4032 Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.
4033 It tasted good, tho.
4034 Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.
4035 Good stuff on all of those.
4036 They also have "Yasu style" nigiri for some types, and they are good.
4037 It usually involves ponzu on top.
4038 Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.
4039 SSC was great!
4040 Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.
4041 The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.
4042 The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).
4043 The base quality of the fish, outside of whatever ponzu, soy, wasabi and other ingredients were on it, was pretty good, but I wouldn't say 5 stars.
4044 Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food, I give it 4.5.
4045 Failing that, I rounded up!
4046 I love this place.
4047 The first time I went, I had my mom and my sister with me.
4048 We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages I've had at any of these nail places.
4049 The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit... the next time I came in- they greeted me by my name.
4050 How often does that happen?
4051 Hello, customer service- welcome back.
4052 It's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be.
4053 Love it here.
4054 Great atmosphere, friendly, good service, affordable.
4055 You won't be disappointed.
4056 Mid-priced dining with high end flavor.
4057 I ordered the special Yelp menu.
4058 Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing.
4059 Very good.
4060 Moved on the the "smart" chicken.
4061 Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto.
4062 Yum!
4063 Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme.
4064 Staff was friendly and very on top of things.
4065 Great experience.
4066 I'm definitely coming back.
4067 give these guys some love!
4068 Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half.
4069 I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store.
4070 The staff have never complained about going an extra mile, the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials.
4071 Special note:  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments.
4072 Tons of specialty soaps, herbal supplements and vitamins.
4073 Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!
4074 Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey's.
4075 My version of heaven.
4076 The food is good and the beer is even better, but what people really go for is the ambiance.
4077 The most awesome potpourri of people.
4078 Old, young, but always interesting.
4079 Say hi to Thomas the cat for me!
4080 He's chilling with the patrons when ever it's not too crowded.
4081 Top notch cheesesteak.
4082 One of the best in the valley.
4083 This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus.
4084 The owners are really nice and friendly.
4085 I'm really glad something moved into this spot.
4086 It's so convenient.
4087 Their desserts are great as well.
4088 I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on.
4089 My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic.
4090 They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that.
4091 I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better.
4092 It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.
4093 Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast!
4094 This place is incredibly legit.
4095 I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of "wiz" this time - So incredibly good.
4096 They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome.
4097 Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious.
4098 I'm a huge fan.
4099 I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place.
4100 Rave rave rave...
4101 The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale.
4102 Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property.
4103 The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious.
4104 We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows.
4105 The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms.
4106 It does pretty well in a tough line-up.
4107 No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons.
4108 It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.
4109 [For further information, please visit: http://phoenix.gov/BNDMAPS/index.html]
4110 Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at!
4111 They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office.
4112 They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses!
4113 The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too!
4114 The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money, and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday, or so it seems!
4115 I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts!
4116 Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return.
4117 Average food.
4118 The burgers were average.
4119 The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor.
4120 I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers.
4121 Cleanliness was average.
4122 The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat.
4123 The kitchen appeared clean.
4124 Service was below average/horrible.
4125 The cashier was very unpleasant.
4126 We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part.
4127 It was pretty slow.
4128 By the time we got the fries they were cold.
4129 The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout.
4130 I know this sounds harsh...it is.
4131 My experience was absolutely horrible.
4132 We will not be back and I don't recommend that you should either.
4133 I love this place.
4134 Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.
4135 It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.
4136 They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.
4137 I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years.
4138 I'm still lucky enough to work close by.
4139 Let me be clear.
4140 I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.
4141 Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.
4142 This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.
4143 There are several choices for Feta cheese.
4144 Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.
4145 I ALWAYS buy my tahini here.
4146 All the prices are very inexpensive.
4147 Need spices???
4148 They have them all.
4149 At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.
4150 The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.
4151 It is NOT a "specialty store" with trendy items and inflated prices.
4152 They sell food items that you will actually use.
4153 The bonus here?
4154 You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.
4155 On to the "restaurant" portion.
4156 Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.
4157 They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.
4158 You go for the food, that's it.
4159 Okay, food.
4160 The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.
4161 Let me repeat.
4162 The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.
4163 GET IT!
4164 Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.
4165 Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.
4166 I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb?
4167 But it's not bad.
4168 Gyros are good and not greasy.
4169 Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.
4170 Chicken shwarma?
4171 Yup, that's good too.
4172 I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when
4173 .
4174 I was looking into gyms around the area.
4175 Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy.
4176 I asked about memberships and then he said, "Sorry we are sold out".
4177 I stood there stunned.
4178 Then he snickered, "Just kidding".
4179 Trying to be a good sport I went with it.
4180 Next came the young sales guy.
4181 He was personable - at first anyways.
4182 Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining.
4183 Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one.
4184 Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids.
4185 Bad sign.
4186 I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks.
4187 The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me.
4188 I had interrupted their important conversation.
4189 Then they were both saying, "Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,".
4190 In other words, no straight answers.
4191 We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began.
4192 I felt like I was purchasing a new car.
4193 "If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."
4194 "If you choose option B, then only here" .
4195 The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children).
4196 When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine.
4197 "Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!"
4198 From there he was down right rude.
4199 I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened.
4200 Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.
4201 It was an awful experience.
4202 Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street.
4203 They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there.
4204 Great and has been for years.
4205 Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.
4206 I recommend combo 'K'
4207 This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food.
4208 Another great Italian find!
4209 My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.
4210 We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.
4211 We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!
4212 When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.
4213 It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.
4214 After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.
4215 BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.
4216 He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!
4217 We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!
4218 Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!
4219 The perfect sweet ending to our meal.
4220 In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.
4221 ****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!
4222 In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.
4223 Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine "Northern Italian Cuisine" without a doubt.
4224 I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!
4225 Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal.
4226 Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.
4227 Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.
4228 The rooms are extremely comfortable, the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.
4229 We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place.
4230 I was sent to Amomi spa from my OBGYN for my  first pregnancy to get all of my ultrasounds.
4231 I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff.
4232 Every ultrasound technician I have had has been really great and knowledgable.
4233 I really like that they have high tech equipment with big plasma tv's on the wall so I could see a big,clear picture of the baby.
4234 Also, the  large spacious rooms are really nice.
4235 On a side note, they have great products to buy in the lobby.
4236 Now pregnant with my 2nd baby, my OB referred me to 2 different places this time for my ultrasounds.
4237 Without hesitation I knew I wanted to go back to Amomi spa again to get all of my ultrasounds.
4238 I have already been twice this time around and looking forward to going again in a few weeks.
4239 We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.
4240 We were celebrating my aunt's birthday, and we ordered from the regular and special menus.
4241 I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera, my hubby had meat loaf, which is always a "tell" for a good place, my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy, and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera, which was fork-tender.
4242 We also had great service - attentive without being too much, and we completely enjoyed our meal.
4243 We will definitely visit this location again.
4244 Pho-yuck this place!
4245 I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese.
4246 I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house.
4247 The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease.
4248 The bun was about the same.
4249 It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease.
4250 I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.
4251 The service was horrible and I will not be back.
4252 we celebrated my birthday all weekend.
4253 we made the trek to bobby q on sunday.
4254 I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing.
4255 Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.
4256 The food is sinfully delicious!
4257 I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like...
4258 I found it too indulgent.
4259 it is definitely a treat and worth trying!
4260 I love those little donuts they give you at the end!
4261 I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now.
4262 My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved.
4263 "Best steak grinda since Baston," they said.
4264 So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went.
4265 The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs.
4266 I loved that.
4267 The place screamed "Boston" from the moment we walked in the door.
4268 When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Brown's diet black cherry.
4269 I was in heaven.
4270 So we got our number and sat down.
4271 While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem.
4272 Guess it was the east coast vibe.
4273 The food came and I was in heaven.
4274 We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad.
4275 Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side.
4276 Lots of mushrooms and peppers.
4277 It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.
4278 What's not to like at Defalco's?
4279 The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies.
4280 So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving.
4281 Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating.
4282 Nic-nacs galore!
4283 After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area, you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.
4284 This is off the beaten path a bit, and after a few miles down streets with no street lights, it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.
4285 It's worth the drive though.
4286 I had two excellent cocktails ("The Last Word" and a "Pendemums Club"), and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.
4287 Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes.
4288 omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.
4289 Stopped by for lunch with my wife.
4290 I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.
4291 Barely edible.
4292 Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.
4293 Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.
4294 I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food.
4295 What an amazing Mini Vacation.
4296 I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect.
4297 The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.
4298 We decided it was so great we never left the resort.
4299 The Room was very clean and very comfortable.
4300 Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely.
4301 The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.
4302 The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable.
4303 The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.
4304 The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.
4305 I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.
4306 The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.
4307 The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.
4308 I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night.
4309 which was very cool.
4310 Worth every penny.
4311 Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.
4312 Enjoy,
4313 Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.
4314 The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.
4315 The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.
4316 Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order.
4317 Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)
4318 Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc.
4319 Lovely outdoor seating area, very dog friendly.
4320 Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there.
4321 Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours.
4322 It was a pleasant experience.
4323 Didn't order food this time but next time I will, because every dish that came by looked magnificent!
4324 All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.
4325 Excellent in every way.
4326 Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.
4327 Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.
4328 We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.)
4329 In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews.
4330 Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein.
4331 The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning.
4332 There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer.
4333 The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items.
4334 He was struggling to explain.
4335 Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time.
4336 Our water had just disappeared.
4337 Then the food.
4338 I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!).
4339 It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread.
4340 The cheese wasn't melted.
4341 I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out.
4342 Icky.
4343 Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids.
4344 It became comical after the third person came out.
4345 My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings.
4346 The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless.
4347 We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and "come back and try us again."
4348 He made no effort to "make things right" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back.
4349 There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre.
4350 The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.
4351 This place is such a delightful treat.
4352 Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within.
4353 Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local.
4354 You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites.
4355 I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix.
4356 Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts!
4357 I'm a fan of their flan, in particular.
4358 Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar.
4359 Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas.
4360 This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day.
4361 But it probably won't.
4362 Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!
4363 !
4364 PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others.
4365 PCG is totally dependable, always excellent.
4366 Service is always good, food excellent.
4367 i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal.
4368 Although the food is not "challenging" in that there are no weird flavors or textures, if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money, you need look no farther than here.
4369 cant go wrong with a Double Double, fries, and a shake!
4370 Always good.
4371 Great service.
4372 I got some cold fries once, called the corporate office, they sent out some gift cards for our meals, then followed up with a thank you card as well.
4373 Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year.
4374 You
4375 This place is very good.
4376 I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but Sunday brunch takes the cake.
4377 Food is all extremely fresh, and tasty.
4378 The best time to go is when this place gets cranking, the style is smaller portions of the food, that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food.
4379 Asian food is always good, and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.
4380 Italian station has fresh pizzas, that once again are made fresh for you, or order a custom calzone like I do.
4381 Mexican station always has the staples, but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos!!!!
4382 .
4383 Berto's gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal.
4384 If you like buffets, do yourself a favor and make this your number 1!!
4385 !
4386 Pizza Venice has, hands down, the best pizza in the Valley.
4387 In my mind, they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal.
4388 Get that with the garlic crust, and you're buying pizza nirvana.
4389 It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly.
4390 Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?
4391 We decided to hit up the "Wine Down Wednesday" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.
4392 Here's what went wrong:
4393 The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?)
4394 after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.
4395 We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.
4396 We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.
4397 Talk about early bird gets the worm!
4398 We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.
4399 She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.
4400 In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.
4401 20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.
4402 We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.
4403 I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.
4404 It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.
4405 Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...
4406 By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.
4407 I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.
4408 They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.
4409 Not so much, but whatever.
4410 I can deal with that.
4411 Then I see the drink section.
4412 The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.
4413 I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.
4414 In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.
4415 By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.
4416 We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own "Wine Down Wednesday" at home.
4417 I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).
4418 I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.
4419 I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.
4420 However, any business can and should have good customer service.
4421 I think this is where the cliched line of "if I could give them less than 1 star I would" comes in...
4422 Oh yeah, and I slapped down a "You've been Yelped" card as I left.
4423 Take that Tastings!
4424 !
4425 Bad quality ingredients.
4426 I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up.
4427 My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.
4428 I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!
4429 My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.
4430 I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.
4431 The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......!
4432 The tacos were very very good though.
4433 I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.
4434 Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water.
4435 Prompt and attentive service, flavorful and delicious food, and a delightful assortment of drink options.
4436 I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life.
4437 I had the grilled shrimp salad, which was fresh, flavorful, and filling.
4438 I also had the sangria, which was pretty good.
4439 My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.
4440 Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat.
4441 An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight.
4442 If I ever find myself in this airport again, you can be sure I'll make my way here.
4443 What a wonderful restaurant.
4444 I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size.
4445 No sauces, no bread, no fries.
4446 The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness.
4447 The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic.
4448 The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for.
4449 And leave room for dessert....yes dessert.
4450 Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl.
4451 just enough to stave off the sugar craving.
4452 The decor is elegant and sophisticated.
4453 Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress.
4454 menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food.
4455 Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch.
4456 Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive.
4457 Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line.
4458 But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation.
4459 Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C. & Robyn N.  This was my third visit ever to a CB & the first time to this one.
4460 I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate, which included a cup of Cole Slaw & a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup.
4461 The service was good at this location, the atmosphere fun, the food delicious & the prices reasonable.
4462 5 Stars!
4463 :-))
4464 Reuben Sandwich Plate $8.19
4465 I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried.
4466 But, this place is clean and fresh.
4467 On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games.
4468 The instructions were easy.
4469 We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball.
4470 Lots to choose from!
4471 Lots of fun!!!
4472 It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us.
4473 The workers are very helpful and Friendly.
4474 Bathrooms were also clean.
4475 I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time.
4476 Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience.
4477 If I were to ever get hooked on crack...
4478 I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts!
4479 They are delicious and addicting.
4480 Best donuts I have ever had.
4481 Considering my experience with a previous dentist, I was hesitant to try a new one.
4482 But my experience was absolutely the best.
4483 Foothills Smiles is the best dentist I have been to in the valley!!
4484 They are professional, friendly, and reassuring allowing their patients to feel comfortable during the visit.
4485 Most people dread going to the dentist, but I feel motivated to continue going to my 6 month check-ups!
4486 !
4487 Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes.
4488 The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun.
4489 The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going.
4490 The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.
4491 My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.
4492 We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!
4493 Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!
4494 The owner is delightful and easy to work with.
4495 If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide.
4496 The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable.
4497 I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!
4498 After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!
4499 My brows have never really been "bad" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.
4500 After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance.
4501 Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference!
4502 I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too!
4503 Thanks Laura!
4504 Just the facts re: full dinner experience:
4505 Ambiance: Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vic's - unbelievable.
4506 Service: perfectly charming, informative and attentive.
4507 Drinks: I don't drink, so read every other review for a review of drinks.
4508 Appetizer: Beef Cho-Cho - amazingly tender, it melts in your mouth.
4509 Great flavor.
4510 Dinner: Trader Vic's Calcutta Curries: good & better when you mix in the variety of garnishes.
4511 fun to play around with the flavors.
4512 Dinner 2: Chinese BBQ Flat Iron Steak: Amazing.
4513 Crispy onions, mashed potatoes and tender/flavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end.
4514 Dessert: (don't know the name) vanilla icecream covered in coconut
4515  on a bed of chocolate sauce: simple, beautiful and tasty.
4516 Overall experience: the best darn dinner experience I've ever had.
4517 Great Mom/Pop store!
4518 We've stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids.
4519 We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato, while the kids love playing/petting all the animals.
4520 Thanks!
4521 There was hair in the food.
4522 Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.
4523 The whole experience was pretty bad.
4524 There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good.
4525 We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.
4526 Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.
4527 Pani Puri was OK
4528 Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor
4529 Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs
4530 Not worth the trip.
4531 I went for brow threading.
4532 Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!
4533 I just found my new "brow lady" and she's just across the street from my office!
4534 LOVE IT!!!
4535 Give her a try!
4536 I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there.
4537 We'll start from the beginning:
4538 The atmosphere was nice for the "jungle" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me.
4539 I felt that I had to scream at her to talk.
4540 Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often.
4541 We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough.
4542 We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross.
4543 Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!!
4544 We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later.
4545 Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!!
4546 Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!!
4547 I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$).
4548 My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten!
4549 I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!!
4550 Not worth it at all!
4551 The food was mediocre but left me sick that night.
4552 Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas...
4553 This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing.
4554 They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good.
4555 I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech.
4556 They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do.
4557 Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax.
4558 My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here.
4559 I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do.
4560 Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!
4561 In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai.
4562 Found this place on Yelp!
4563 and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time.
4564 The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed (or found) had we not been looking for it.
4565 Oh, but what a magical dining experience!
4566 The cashew chicken was the best I'd ever had (and we eat Thai a LOT!)
4567 and the chicken satay was exceptional.
4568 Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian (tofu) curry dish he loved.
4569 Wish this place wasn't 400 miles from my house.
4570 I'd be eating here every week!
4571 No attitude, efficient lines, clean, well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries?????
4572 Is this USPS or a dream?
4573 Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like... weird, or, something, but it feels so right for this location.
4574 I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.
4575 The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.
4576 The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).
4577 The chicken wings were not that great either.
4578 The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.
4579 I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.
4580 Satori to Kaigen!
4581 (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)
4582 1st review.
4583 Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner.
4584 Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.
4585 I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.
4586 A "2" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!
4587 Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score!
4588 My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!
4589 Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.
4590 They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.
4591 I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...
4592 Smells are incredible.
4593 Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order!
4594 I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice.
4595 They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.
4596 #17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar
4597 Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed.
4598 Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.
4599 # 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal
4600 Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.
4601 This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.
4602 They even "fenced in" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest.
4603 Spice and crunch with every munch.
4604 Beautiful.
4605 Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome.
4606 Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.
4607 # 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!
4608 ): Umami
4609 Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut.
4610 I do now.
4611 The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.
4612 Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.
4613 Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.
4614 Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.
4615 Coconut Ice Cream: Yum
4616 Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.
4617 As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.
4618 Coconut ice cream is delicious.
4619 Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.
4620 Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy.
4621 Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.
4622 I will be back.
4623 I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.
4624 Family-run places are truly number 1.
4625 Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV
4626 Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?
4627 I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place.
4628 The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty, but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly, and helpful.
4629 Foxy eats Evanger's, which is really hard to find, and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me.
4630      A month later, I run out of dog food....so I call Goober (after research I find they sell Evanger's for the cheapest price) and they delivered it right to me.
4631 I wasn't home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy !
4632 They left their newsletter, some reference cards, and their product list (which is HUUUUGGGEEE) in a bag hanging from my door.
4633 The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase!
4634 Oh of course- I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge!!!
4635 I'll never get my dog food anywhere else.
4636 So yummy!!
4637 My favorite Mexican place!!
4638 Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip.
4639 The extra spicy green salsa is so good too.
4640 We are regulars here.
4641 I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you.
4642 We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.
4643 They also refill propane tanks.
4644 Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers.
4645 Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)
4646 Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I don't have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods.
4647 Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful.
4648 While I am at it I should probably apologize for "sampling" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop.
4649 And one more thing, it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!
4650 Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while!!
4651 My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible.
4652 I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why, until now.
4653 We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch (um, can you say bachelorette party?!).
4654 It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you.
4655 It was $75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends.
4656 And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense.
4657 Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too!
4658 I can't wait to go back!
4659 Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym.
4660 The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes.
4661 It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room.
4662 But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility.
4663 It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!
4664 Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side.
4665 What a brewpub should be.
4666 The beers are great.
4667 The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.
4668 Lisa, the server was very helpfull.
4669 I need say no more.
4670 eeew.
4671 It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board.
4672 The food was downhill from there.
4673 The entire place smelled like fried onions.
4674 Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.
4675 Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.
4676 The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.
4677 And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!
4678 (Trust me - this works.)
4679 There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.
4680 It's not your average Mexican fast food.
4681 It's a little more pricey but well worth it.
4682 Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).
4683 Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.
4684 I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
4685 Needs a new name - now.
4686 The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.
4687 I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep "Pischke's" alive.
4688 But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.
4689 Call it "The Blue Ribbon Cafe" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.
4690 If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.
4691 The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that.
4692 I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great.
4693 I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made, good food out here in Queen Creek.
4694 My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese.
4695 Its great on anything.
4696 I frequently order the tomato, basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious.
4697 The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable.
4698 Don't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have.
4699 Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80% of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay.
4700 the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor, all other things such as the bedrooms, bathroom, lobby, restaurant and pools were great!
4701 Amenities included:
4702 1. pet fish (that someone else fed)
4703 2. complimentary granola for the race day
4704 3. smores for our firepit (next to the pool)
4705 4. nice wait-staff that was pleasant and chatted us up
4706 5. super fast towel replenishment service (4 girls use up a lot of towels)
4707 6. great cabanas -we never had a problem snagging one or two of them
4708 7. happy hour, decent food, delicious alcohol...
4709 8. cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at
4710 9. dog friendly
4711 10. heated pools
4712 love it!
4713 I will stay here again for sure..
4714 This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.
4715 It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!
4716 Always fresh, always funny!
4717 Great place for a date night or family night!
4718 Even my teenagers love it!
4719 I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.
4720 To finish off the night, head down the street to "The Sugar Bowl" for fresh ice cream!
4721 I was very sad to see this restaurant go.
4722 I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else!
4723 Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.
4724 Great service.
4725 Very convenient to downtown hotels.
4726 I can't help but love this place.
4727 I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened.
4728 I move further away and I keep coming back.
4729 The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists!
4730 Really can't go wrong with this place.
4731 I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday!
4732 It is a great place for kids to have fun.
4733 Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything.
4734 Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration.
4735 So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings.
4736 The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there.
4737 We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow.
4738 Needless to say this is a place that the kids love.
4739 They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about.
4740 OK.
4741 So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.
4742 I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.
4743 Boy, they are pretty sad.
4744 I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.
4745 Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right?
4746 Haha.).
4747 Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.
4748 I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.
4749 You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.
4750 I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.
4751 The flight attendants are rude.
4752 This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.
4753 You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.
4754 Would I fly US Airways again?
4755 No way.
4756 If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?
4757 Maybe.
4758 I just hope that their service of customers get better.
4759   Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.
4760 Oops.
4761 I would not survive without Channel 8. i really don't watch much TV, but when I do, I want it to count.
4762 Let me see: Keeping Up Appearances, Coupling, RedDwarf, Antiques Roadshow, NewsHour, Nova, This Old House, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Frontline, Horizon, Scientific American Frontiers, The War, As Time Goes By, Red Green.
4763 Plus, tons of responsible programming for kids in the am and afternoon.
4764 (I don't think RedDwarf and Coupling air on PBS anymore - but thanks to PBS for introducing me)
4765 I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious!
4766 The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition.
4767 If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go!
4768 Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.
4769 Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9.
4770 We are in town and are here to see some friends.
4771 Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation.
4772 I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet.
4773 So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths.
4774 I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do.
4775 I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements.
4776 She said ok and that was it.
4777 Nice job Texas Roadhouse.
4778 NOT!!!
4779 There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table.
4780 One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it.
4781 Fantastic donuts!
4782 Great selection!
4783 Coffee was definitely above average!
4784 Just had Daphnes for the last time.
4785 In the 3 times that we have ordered from them, they cannot seem to get a simple order right.
4786 One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order.
4787 Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong.
4788 Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus.
4789 HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline.
4790 We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book.
4791 Nice customer service!!!!!
4792 !
4793 I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often.
4794 I LOVE it!
4795 I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to!
4796 You can find everything you need right there.
4797 The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc.
4798 grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own!
4799 My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM!
4800 Dinner in 20 anyone?
4801 ;-)
4802 Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!
4803 !
4804 I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!
4805 !
4806 2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes!
4807 Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!
4808 So, I now frequent The Vig.
4809 If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.
4810 He's quick with the beverages and funny.
4811 Enjoy yourself.
4812 You deserve it!
4813 This place can get packed during dinner hour, though.
4814 Honestly, this is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.
4815 I'm a sucker for wood-fired goodness and fresh mozzarella--Cibo does both to perfection.
4816 Additionally, I've come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls.
4817 The wine list is not overly extensive, just efficient and thorough like it should be.
4818 The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience.
4819 Be warned:  Cibo is pretty tiny, causing a wait on weekends.
4820 I love the Madagascar coconut white tea!
4821 The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they don't list the caffeine content;(
4822 WOW!
4823 I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.
4824 We went for brunch and it was amazing.
4825 Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.
4826 The johnny cakes were out of this world!
4827 They have a granola-y taste to them, are filled with blueberries, and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.
4828 It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.
4829 Despite being three pancakes, they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.
4830 They made me feel satisfied but not "stuffed" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.
4831 That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.
4832 I love this place!
4833 It is beautiful inside, I love their theme, I love their concept, and I love the food.
4834 Can't wait to try more.
4835 Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.
4836 This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge.
4837 There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)
4838 It's just an utter disaster.
4839 When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.
4840 This place does not need a 'face-lift.'
4841 It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated.
4842 You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer you're there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer.
4843 Guys always have the weight benches dominated.
4844 There's never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm, then it starts to thin out.
4845 Blah bla bla blah bla.
4846 Considering this is the "Biltmore" location... huge disappointment.
4847 Fact.
4848 This place was messy and loud.
4849 The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.
4850 Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.
4851 I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
4852 great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere...
4853 This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years.
4854 Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm.
4855 You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here.
4856 They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many "Libras" (Pounds) and you want them to make it "Preparada" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag.
4857 If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here.
4858 I cant get enough of this place!
4859 !
4860 Love.
4861 It.
4862 Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.
4863 The sides are really good, too.
4864 I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.
4865 If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.
4866 Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....
4867 Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their "schmears" appear to be highly processed.
4868 I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.
4869 I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).
4870 First, no salt bagels.
4871 Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?
4872 Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.
4873 Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.
4874 The other half was basically dry.
4875 Unbelievable.
4876 Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.
4877 Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you.

4880 Why do I always forget this place,
4881 When deciding on where to eat lunch,
4882 Here I could really stuff my face,
4883 It doesn't matter if it's dinner or brunch.
4884 My wonderful, tasty Honey Do,
4885 Alfalfa sprouts, turkey on whole wheat,
4886 Add a slice of cheddar for you,
4887 This sandwhich cannot be beat.
4888 Located not to far from the hospital,
4889 So you get a great crowd of nurses,
4890 The hotties who come here are pivotal,
4891 I'll stay until the crowd disperses.
4892 Get the soup in a bread bowl,
4893 Or a bag of chips if you please,
4894 Add a cookie for your hole,
4895 I'll say bless you after you sneeze.
4896 Bottom line is you cannot go wrong,
4897 You'll love whatever you order,
4898 Go home and hit the bong,
4899 And then make a run for the border.
4900 DEEEES NUTS!!
4901 !
4902 Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome, awesome hotel.
4903 I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic.
4904 I love all the rooms.
4905 If you can get a suite, you're an extra lucky duck, but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms.
4906 The bar and restaurant is also great, with fantastic appetizers, wonderful specialty cocktails, and fun rat pack music.
4907 Breakfast is better than most restaurants, forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare.
4908 The location is also good, with plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.
4909 This place is not within my normal price range at all, but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area.
4910 Man oh man...
4911 I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of "if you don't have anything nice to say..."
4912 All I have to say is this:
4913 We ordered food.
4914 It came totally wrong.
4915 I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that's how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese.
4916 This just shows a complete inability to read the order.
4917 People make adjustments all the time.
4918 I have worked at a restaurant.
4919 I have fucked up.
4920 I should have been lashed 40 times!
4921 Read what people order!
4922 So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill.
4923 The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich.
4924 It was a monumental fucking embarrassment.
4925 I cannot believe they let that thing out the door.
4926 I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer...
4927 Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.
4928 I just hated it.
4929 A lot.
4930 Sorry, I'm sure you're nice people with good intentions.
4931 I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them (I wear the spiky-heeled high heels).
4932 For $12, not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color, size and type of heel (and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly), but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them.
4933 Many of my shoes had toes that were worn, shredded or faded; Ariel made them like absolutely new.
4934 Amazing!
4935 My shoes are not Prada or Gucci.
4936 They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and man-made everything else.
4937 :)  However, Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were "the king's" shoes.
4938 It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back.
4939 I will return.
4940 Thank you, Ariel!
4941 Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.
4942 They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.
4943 Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...
4944 They then cut each slice into 4's.
4945 Perfect for sharing!
4946 We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.
4947 The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!
4948 AWESOME!!
4949 PLUS, they have complementary valet parking.
4950 Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.
4951 I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.
4952 They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.
4953 I agree with Tracy, my wife and I are big fans of Fiorella's.
4954 Definitely a treasure for the northwest valley.
4955 The service is great and the food is delicious.
4956 Prices are a bit higher than other dining options in the area, but the friendly people and yummy food are worth it.
4957 Best UNIQUE breakfast / brunch / lunch spot.
4958 This tiny place may look like a boring little bakery, but think again!
4959 SIt outside on the small patio area, ck out the GR8 crepes!
4960 savory, breakfasty, sweet - u pick or choose!
4961 Hubby luvs lox & cream cheese & capers.
4962 I luv the chicken, aspargus, basil, feta :-)
4963 Mmmmmmmm.
4964 Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.
4965 It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.
4966 There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.
4967 The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!
4968 They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.
4969 I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made.
4970 Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!
4971 I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.
4972 This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.
4973 The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot.
4974 I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.
4975 It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.
4976 Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion.
4977 A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines.
4978 It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch.
4979 The food reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals.
4980 The beef with red salsa was super good...and not to mention the warm, handmade tortillas.
4981 The prices were decent, the service was excellent and the food was great.
4982 ;-)
4983 I've never been to this location before.
4984 My husband had taken his car here previously, and asked me to take it in today (there was a nail a front tire).
4985 The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted, even though all agents were busy helping other customers -- excellent customer service to acknowledge I'm there!
4986 Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it.
4987 He tested to see how far in the nail was, and realized it didn't puncture, so he took it out and said the tire was fine.
4988 I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires, so asked for a quote.
4989 He gave me a few options, and told me what driving habits they'd be best for.
4990 He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it, and included it in the price instead of "shockingly" adding it in when I would pay like most places would.
4991 I never thought for a second that I was being oversold.
4992 It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car.
4993 Quick.
4994 Clean.
4995 Friendly.
4996 Intelligent.
4997 Honest.
4998 That about sums up this place.
4999 I'd recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location.
5000 Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call "The Slope", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time.
5001 The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used.
5002 No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place.
5003 Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicago's Italian beef,  I didn't get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind,  use beef broth if the meat gets dry, not a whole can of olive oil,  YUK!
5004 It didn't have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor,  it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild.
5005 No stars for that beef,  the only saving grace was it didn't make me too sick,  I expected to be sick for days not just one day!
5006 Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros!
5007 This location is my favorite, although they are all good.
5008 My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free.
5009 You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks.
5010 You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile!
5011 I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge.
5012 added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to.
5013 Quick drive-through for on the go.
5014 This place always pleases!
5015 Their sandwiches are always great, bread is great, pizza is AWESOME, and their short ribs are great.
5016 The food is SO fresh!
5017 The waiters are kind and friendly.
5018 When we asked if they had some of their awesome ice cream, she kindly told us the freezer broke.
5019 I heart the deli!
5020 Love Love Love!
5021 All you need to do is order dessert here.
5022 It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
5023 Loved my haircut.
5024 Walked in and waited for just a minute.
5025 The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
5026 Great for young kids... tons to do and see
5027 Obsessed.
5028 Like, I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place.
5029 Please make one in Arcadia!
5030 Pleeeaaassse.
5031 Loved the winkie!
5032 Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert.
5033 I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!
5034 Great for people watching and the service is always great!
5035 Get there early or it will be standing room only!
5036 Every time I come here the staff is so rude!
5037 Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck.
5038 Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people???
5039 ?
5040 I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time.
5041 We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July.
5042 Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart.
5043 We just walk in now and they see us and say "Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"
5044 Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order.
5045 I have tried most of the menu items.
5046 The garlic eggplant is also pretty great.
5047 The thai basil is also amazing.
5048 I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry.
5049 I never have had a good curry experience.
5050 Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan.
5051 Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet.
5052 The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere.
5053 Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often.
5054 That is pretty amazing.
5055 If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once.
5056 Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come.
5057 I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!
5058 !
5059 I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.
5060 I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.
5061 The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .
5062 I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.
5063 When my salmon dish came out I said to my self "WHAT in the hell?"
5064 Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.
5065 Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?
5066 I work in the food industry and the food was crap.
5067 Next, the entree.
5068 The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.
5069 Explaining to me how delicious this special was.
5070 So I took his advice and ordered.
5071 When the dish came out I said to my self again "What in the HELL?"
5072 Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.
5073 The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.
5074 The funny thing was.
5075 The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.
5076 I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.
5077 The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.
5078 I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre.
5079 Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event.
5080 The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce.
5081 Be warned!
5082 I am in love with the cinema suite!
5083 Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie.
5084 The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.
5085 The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice.
5086 For movie that are 2+ hours long, watching movie on the recliner is the best experience.
5087 Also great place to go on a date :)
5088 Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.
5089 I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.
5090 The combination was amazing.
5091 I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.
5092 It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.
5093 The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.
5094 The staff is attentive and very helpful.
5095 Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.
5096 On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.
5097 The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.
5098 Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.
5099 Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.
5100 It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.
5101 It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.
5102 Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive.
5103 The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.
5104 Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.
5105 They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.
5106 What's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.
5107 Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.
5108 Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.
5109 Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.
5110 From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.
5111 One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.
5112 Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.
5113 The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.
5114 The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.
5115 Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.
5116 Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.
5117 What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.
5118 Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.
5119 If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.
5120 In one word...excellent!
5121 My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer, when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement, which happened right before we left for our trip.
5122 The room was huge, the grounds were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and everything there was so peaceful.
5123 The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag, but somewhat hidden from the outside world.
5124 We are hoping to return soon.
5125 Holy AMAZING.
5126 I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.
5127 We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.
5128 I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.
5129 I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu.
5130 As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.
5131 I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!
5132 Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo.
5133 We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market).
5134 They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.
5135 Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.
5136 And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette).
5137 Great Frozen Yogurt.
5138 Helpful staff, clean enviroment.
5139 Yikes...I won't be going back.
5140 The ordering system is confusing.
5141 The staff also seemed confused.
5142 The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.
5143 THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!!
5144 Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bear's!
5145 Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries
5146 Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!
5147 I love Scottsdale Child Care & Learning Centers.
5148 My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old.
5149 The teachers are wonderful.
5150 Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child.
5151 My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers.
5152 She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care.
5153 She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off.
5154 I would recommend this center to any parent, especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time.
5155 This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!
5156 Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.
5157 If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.
5158 It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy "organic" foods.
5159 I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving "all-natural" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.
5160 People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.
5161 I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.
5162 I'm excited to try this place again.
5163 Based on Yelp reviews, I went to check this place out while I'm working on assignment in Phoenix.
5164 As promised the food was great, the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas.
5165 I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me.
5166 The Fez Kisra sounded good, but I should have listened to Russell's recommendations.
5167 I will definitely try those next time, which will be soon.
5168 The wine selection was varied, but didn't blow my mind.
5169 I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasn't nearly as good as the most popular (shockingly).
5170 The place combines hip and tasteful decorating, good music, great food and a nightlife atmosphere.
5171 Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guys/girls if you don't want to be overly bothered.
5172 Still solid, still delicious.
5173 I love this place!
5174 I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment, they also rent heaps of tools and equipment.
5175 Think hedge trimmers, lawn aerators, cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project, and so, don't want to invest in the equipment.
5176 In our case, we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter's freeze, an unwelcome sapling, a dead tree, branches encroaching the roof, and to tame some monstrous oleanders.
5177 I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive.
5178 Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.
5179 The process was pretty easy.
5180 We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.
5181 Pro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm.
5182 You can return it Monday morning, and only be charged for one day (Saturday), since they are closed on Sunday.
5183 I can always count on Sacks.
5184 It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.
5185 I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.
5186 Sacks is my "go to place" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too.
5187 Best Mexican food in phoenix... very reasonable prices...
5188 After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.
5189 It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.
5190 Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.
5191 I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!
5192 Even more amusing is their "industrial pale ale" is an IPA but it is not bitter.
5193 So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.
5194 Then people say "Oh I don't like IPA's" and want something else.
5195 Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.
5196 Amazing.
5197 The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.
5198 To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.
5199 I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.
5200 This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location.
5201 Just want to Say ThankYou Hawaiian Airlines for Making My Grandparents Flight Very Enjoyable.
5202 They Say Nothing But good things
5203 Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.
5204 Dad loved his gyro.
5205 Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.
5206 SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.
5207 Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.
5208 Hooray for pleasing the parents!
5209 !
5210 Okay, so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom.
5211 I freaking love Nordstrom!
5212 The store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly.
5213 I have never had such good service anywhere else.
5214 I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked.
5215 Aside from the service, the selection is very nice.
5216 I always go during the half yearly sale, so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds!
5217 I am big on shoes and the selection is very good.
5218 They always have some cool shoes that I can't seem to live without.
5219 Also, the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want.
5220 If you go, go in June or  January when the sales are great!
5221 Make sure you check out the shoes!
5222 While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.
5223 I don't go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.
5224 The food is amazing.
5225 The fry bread isn't greasy and I don't know how they do that.
5226 The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.
5227 The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.
5228 If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House.
5229 My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.
5230 Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.
5231 I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.
5232 My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.
5233 The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.
5234 She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast.
5235 The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.
5236 Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.
5237 Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.
5238 Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.
5239 If they are eating there, you know it's good.
5240 Just had to thank them for their service.
5241 This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.
5242 And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.
5243 Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.
5244 I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.
5245 On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.
5246 We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.
5247 During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.
5248 But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.
5249 We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.
5250 These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.
5251 Check with them to see when they're available.
5252 They're really worth the extra effort.
5253 Although Roberto's delivers, I regret that they won't come to Dana Point.
5254 When I mean 5 star, I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!!
5255 Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!
5256 The food, not to mention the service, is truly unbelievably delicious!!
5257 If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so, the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!
5258 !
5259 HATS OFF FOR FnB!
5260 !
5261 WOW!
5262 Great donuts!
5263 Honestly you can't eat just one!
5264 I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!
5265 Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!
5266 Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.
5267 I didn't want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.
5268 I haven't regretted that decision at all.
5269 The chicken tamales are the BEST!
5270 They are super spicy, the way I like.
5271 The beef with red sauce is great too, not very spicy at all.
5272 The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.
5273 I am hooked on these tamales.
5274 I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip.
5275 Lucky me, Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel!
5276 This is a tiny little joint, maybe 20 tables.
5277 The menu is like a book, there is so much to choose from, rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers.
5278 My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish (yeah, it sounds trite, but I was in the mood and it was so delicious!)
5279 We had tons of leftovers, which we shared with a homey down the street, I hope he enjoyed it.
5280 Highly recommended, and if I'm ever back in town, I will visit again.
5281 It was 3:45pm and I'm about to jump on a bus to the light rail.
5282 We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco, but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine.
5283 Useless fact: they're 26th in line.
5284 So in theory, at 5:00 we're in the first seating.
5285 And so it happens, the publicly-underwritten public transit arrives (my one-way trip cost $1.25, my gf's unvalidated parking fee was $12) and two Hop Knots later, we're sitting down and waiting.
5286 Typical order, one of everything, two Biancoverdes.
5287 At this point being almost review #200, the details are irrelevant.
5288 The crust is great, the cheese is great, the Sonny Boy is uber-salty and delicious, fruity olive oil, holy shit these roasted peppers, etc.
5289 Why is that person staring at me through the window?
5290 So I guess the point is, if you make it your only point to go to Bianco, it's hard to be disappointed.
5291 Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state!
5292 He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs.
5293 We have used him for several years and trust him completely.
5294 INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for!
5295 Must try!
5296 Worth the drive!
5297 GET.
5298 THE.
5299 CIDER.
5300 Just do it.
5301 I'm a huge cider fan and this is the best I've ever had.
5302 Not syrupy sweet, and nice and cloudy so you know that it's been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction.
5303 Their master brewer also brews all of their sodas.
5304 Grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best.
5305 My favorite is the vanilla.
5306 The staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if they're not busy.
5307 The sandwiches are quite tasty as well.
5308 I've had the Mario's Monster Mill-wich, and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the French dip.
5309 All have been really good, but if you don't like a lot of feta on your sandwich I would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on (Mario's)!
5310 I love it so it was no problem for me.
5311 I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys.
5312 I like this location, nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me.
5313 No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass.
5314 During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants.
5315 Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout.
5316 Losers.
5317 Everything here is awesome!
5318 I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house.
5319 The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well.
5320 Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully.
5321 The staff is very friendly and attentive.
5322 Definitely try this place!
5323 It's a regular lunch spot for my office.
5324 They also have great lunch specials.
5325 :)
5326 They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.
5327 Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.
5328 Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know).
5329 Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.
5330 We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.
5331 The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.
5332 Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).
5333 I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.
5334 The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.
5335 Oh my.
5336 For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.
5337 The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.
5338 If you love garlic, you'll love this.
5339 My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.
5340 He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.
5341 I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.
5342 One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.
5343 This is not a complaint in anyway.
5344 However, next go around we may share an entree.
5345 Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.
5346  Will definitely return.
5347 NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ.
5348 From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes.
5349 Top end.
5350 Yes, you pay for it.
5351 But it's special, like Valentines Day.
5352 Just pay out and enjoy the treat.
5353 Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch.
5354 Great wraps and sandwiches.
5355 Haven't tried anything later here yet.
5356 But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list.
5357 Great tasting frozen yogurt, excellent customer service, very clean inside.
5358 Healthy choice for a sweet treat.
5359 If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best.
5360 Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well.
5361 Always great quality, and a large selection.
5362 Easy ordering process and awesome customer service.
5363 One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore.
5364 I was really excited to try this restaurant, and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out.
5365 The service was very friendly and the store was clean, cute, and colorful...but the food was very disappointing.
5366 My husband ordered the curry chicken, and although it tasted okay, he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times.
5367 I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes, but the "Calypso Pasta" I ordered had tiny, tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting, and really it was just mediocre.
5368 I'm bummed I wanted to like this place.
5369 I can't say enough good things about this place.
5370 Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign.
5371 Local Breeze was totally down to contribute.
5372 So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community.
5373 Awesome.
5374 But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back.
5375 The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent.
5376 You definitely get your money's worth.
5377 And there's a reason why my profile says that my "recent discovery" is "spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."
5378 That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet.
5379 And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.
5380 The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down.
5381 We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general.
5382 The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it.
5383 If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.
5384 This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily.
5385 This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close.
5386 I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good.
5387 I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.
5388 It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table.
5389 The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee.
5390 The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano.
5391 It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg.
5392 The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top.
5393 It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it!
5394 I attempted but could not finish it.
5395 The big pancake was left uneaten.
5396 They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone.
5397 The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee.
5398 I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast.
5399 I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.
5400 So perfect.
5401 The atmosphere is just spot on.
5402 I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill.
5403 I love their Apple Harvest (?)
5404 salad.
5405 So delicious and beautifully prepared.
5406 Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!).
5407 Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!
5408 !
5409 Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.
5410 Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.
5411 But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.
5412 So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.
5413 That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.
5414 They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.
5415 I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.
5416 No bueno.
5417 From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes.
5418 They have a nice patio.
5419 They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games.
5420 They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables.
5421 Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back.
5422 This place is just bad.
5423 Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas).
5424 They offer a pretty basic beer selection.
5425 I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on "special."
5426 The food is pretty bad, even for bar food.
5427 And pricey.
5428 Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good.
5429 Everything seems to be made from "freezer to fryer" or packaged products.
5430 I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries.
5431 I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs.
5432 In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.
5433 One of the owners was there on a few occasions.
5434 I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his.
5435 He treats the place like his kingdom.
5436 He'll ask patrons "how is everything?"
5437 and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say.
5438 I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.
5439 In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen.
5440 I'd rather go elsewhere.
5441 Wow?!
5442 Is this the new Barcelona?!
5443 Yuck!
5444 Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.
5445 All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.
5446 We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.
5447 What's the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?
5448 We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.
5449 We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.
5450 This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.
5451 Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.
5452 I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet, hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service, but their lunch buffet was awesome!
5453 Very reasonably priced, including an iced tea.
5454 It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.
5455 Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce, and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.
5456 If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go.
5457 OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the "great lakes") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.
5458 The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.
5459 I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.
5460 Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.
5461 But that is probably not what you want to hear...
5462 The "event" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.
5463 The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!
5464 It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.
5465 Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!
5466 ), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.
5467 P.S.
5468 They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like.
5469 So, what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing??????
5470 The only sauces they had was honey mustard and "Canes Secret sauce" Can I say EEWWWW!!
5471 I thought that the sauce tasted terrible.
5472 I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasn't even good!
5473 The coleslaw was awful also.
5474 I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland.
5475 Those were the only 2 items that I tried, not that there were really any more items  on the menu, Texas toast?
5476 And Fries I think??
5477 Overall, I would never go back.
5478 Had the pastrami sandwich.
5479 It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami.
5480 It was good.
5481 Good food hAs the power of time travel.
5482 This is a great place.
5483 Plus the coke is primo.
5484 Good mixture.
5485 The ice makes it over the top.
5486 I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.
5487 Cashier was nice and very helpful.
5488 I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.
5489 Fries were only warm, not hot.
5490 Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.
5491 Lots of trash on the floor.
5492 After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.
5493 I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.
5494 She offered a free dessert: I accepted.
5495 In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back.
5496 Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro.
5497 Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG.
5498 My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything!
5499 We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate.
5500 The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2).
5501 The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious.
5502 Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two.
5503 The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus.
5504 Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.
5505 Consistent is a great word to describe this place.
5506 The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there.
5507 (they're great too).
5508 It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour.
5509 The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly.
5510 You feel like you are part of the family here.
5511 Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce.
5512 All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!
5513 How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge?
5514 Sheesh!
5515 I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge.
5516 The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with.
5517 It is a dish of fantastic, cheesy wonderfulness.
5518 Also, please note the veggie wrap.
5519 HOLY SMOKES.
5520 Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies, feta cheese, and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita!
5521 Really?
5522 Really Aaron May?
5523 The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff, and comfortable setting.
5524 It's decorated all rustic and cushy, and true to form there are antler-chandeliers.
5525 You will also find pool tables, darts, several TV's, jenga, bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained.
5526 Check it out...
5527 Just went for my first time last night with "the "girls".
5528 Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out.
5529 Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza.
5530 It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious.
5531 Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate.
5532 Sublime!
5533 Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)
5534 I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!
5535 She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.
5536 I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more!
5537 It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon.
5538 The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person.
5539 I will be coming back to Trish for nails again!
5540 The entire staff was friendly and professional.
5541 Great Salon!
5542 !
5543 Mister Softee is an all-star, he showed up on time, provided great service, and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !
5544 !
5545 Awesome food anyone???
5546 Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale, AZ.
5547 Gorgeous dining room!
5548 Excellent service (with our server Gabe)!
5549 And the food was AAAMMMAZZING!
5550 It's located at Fashion Mall, but it's NOT a "mall" restaurant.
5551 A MUST go!
5552 Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!
5553 !
5554 This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.
5555 Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).
5556 Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.
5557 YUM!
5558 On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.
5559 All are tasty.
5560 For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.
5561 You will have a great time!
5562 NOTE - beware of dirty old men.
5563 They'll hit on your friends!
5564 So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life.
5565 The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing.
5566 They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here.
5567 The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.
5568 I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult.
5569 A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company.
5570 When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit.
5571 However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department.
5572 When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity.
5573 I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature.
5574 The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new "parents" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend.
5575 Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week.
5576 The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home.
5577 To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex.
5578 I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home.
5579 As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage.
5580 I fell in love immediately.
5581 To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice.
5582 Of course I had to give it to my new found friend.
5583 At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog.
5584 So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense.
5585 While I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves.
5586 They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day.
5587 When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me.
5588 A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had.
5589 When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash.
5590 They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend.
5591 And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit?
5592 This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home.
5593 I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is.
5594 They even have horses that they rescued.
5595 Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though.
5596 So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.
5597 Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic.
5598 The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable.
5599 A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
5600 Ban't wait to return!
5601 Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenix's beautiful Papago Park.
5602 It's one of the most powerful scenic views in our city, and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape.
5603 Just a short hike up the butte and you'll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion.
5604 At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness.
5605 The hole faces south, giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.
5606 Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once.
5607 No fee to enter.
5608 Bring a camera!
5609 Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area.
5610 Like other reviewers have stated, once you've gotten used to Squaw and Camelback, give this one a try.
5611 It'll kick your ass.
5612 It's about a 2600' climb in elevation, so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks.
5613 You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks.
5614 I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.
5615 It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.
5616 My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.
5617 Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.
5618 Don't feed the wildlife.
5619 I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.
5620 I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.
5621 She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.
5622 She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.
5623 I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone.
5624 What happened to this place?
5625 The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there.
5626 What a shame!
5627 I think many were only just discovering it.
5628 Pleasant, courteous,  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day!
5629 What more could you ask for!
5630 It's pretty awesome here!
5631 I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!
5632 The portions were large and the price was good.
5633 The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.
5634 I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.
5635 They were both great!
5636 I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.
5637 The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix.
5638 Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona.
5639 The service was great as well!
5640 The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.
5641 *****UPDATE*****
5642 Looks like they went out of business.
5643 Haven't been open for two weeks now.....
5644 I went in at 8 on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating.
5645 The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.
5646 The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.
5647 She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.
5648 It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.
5649 The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.
5650 The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.
5651 I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.
5652 For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.
5653 The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.
5654 I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.
5655 When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.
5656 Also, my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny.
5657 Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.
5658 This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.
5659 They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here.
5660 Everything about this company sucks.
5661 Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly, I mean HORRIBLY!
5662 They destroy the communities in which they sit.
5663 I'm done, never shopping here again, I don't care how cheap something might be, there is a high cost to low prices afterall...
5664 Great little restaurant.
5665 The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.
5666 I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.
5667 The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.
5668 They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.
5669 It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out.
5670 The best bar in town.
5671 I' m psycho for this place.
5672 The sell cupcakes now!
5673 (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)
5674 NOM NOM NOM.
5675 Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those "$99 room" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them.
5676 I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.
5677 Great service at reasonable price-well worth it.
5678 My carpet cleaner from now on.
5679 Let me start by saying that I love tacos.
5680 I eat lots of tacos.
5681 When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos.
5682 That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos.
5683 I'm pretty picky about my tacos.
5684 I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on.
5685 I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos.
5686 That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix.
5687 The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.
5688 However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two.
5689 I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious).
5690 It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier.
5691 This place is heavenly!!!
5692 I have dreams about it on a regular basis.
5693 The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors.
5694 TASTY!
5695 Yum best donuts in Phoenix.
5696 Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!
5697 The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!
5698 We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .
5699 They were very busy ,but, we did not have to wait too long at all.
5700 Our server Colleen was great!
5701 She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.
5702 The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.
5703 The menu is fantastic!
5704 Lots to choose from.
5705 We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot.
5706 Nice Place and we will be back!
5707 This place is a gem.
5708 The food is amazing.
5709 It's cheap.
5710 The service is good.
5711 My favorite part?
5712 The place never changes.
5713 I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order.
5714 The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious.
5715 The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce.
5716 I've never found better hummus in my life.
5717 I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*).
5718 SO good!
5719 The iced tea has a hint of rose water.
5720 OH and the gyro?
5721 Hands down, the best in town.
5722 Did I mention they have a market attached?
5723 Talk about the best price on spices in town!
5724 The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!
5725 I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue.
5726 I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life.
5727 Shut up and try it.
5728 The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early.
5729 Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!
5730 We decided to eat here on a whim.
5731 My husband got the burger brûlée and I got the beach house burger.
5732 Both were fantastic.
5733 The buns were perfect and we both agreed these were the best burgers we had had in a really long time.
5734 The sweet potato tater tots and French fries were also amazing.
5735 For $27 it fed our family of five.
5736 I'm definitely going back.
5737 Friendly service, casual atmosphere, and clean.
5738 Thumbs up all the way!
5739 I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try.
5740 Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong!
5741 All I can say is wow!!!
5742 This place is amazingly delicious.
5743 I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house!
5744 This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight.
5745 This place is so good.
5746 I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again.
5747 Bad experience...Terrible service, terrible food.
5748 First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.
5749 Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.
5750 One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices.
5751 It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.
5752 Second of all, our server was awful.
5753 There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.
5754 Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.
5755 Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.
5756 We had to track her down.
5757 I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.
5758 I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.
5759 I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.
5760 The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.
5761 So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.
5762 The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch.
5763 I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant.
5764 I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.
5765 And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.
5766 The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.
5767 So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.
5768 One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.
5769 Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.
5770 The entire "patio" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids.
5771 Love this place.
5772 Great Happy Hour.
5773 Nasty workers and over priced trash
5774 Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!
5775 Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause, GREAT deal and now fine free!
5776 I have been meaning to stop in but keep driving on by.
5777 I am SO GLAD that I stopped.
5778 I was pleased the moment I walked in.
5779 The store is well lit and cheery, the books line the wall making you feel like you're walking into a oasis of knowledge.
5780 I found 10 copies of the book I was looking for (I needed 10 copies) and the owner said he will order me copies of two books he didn't have.
5781 Also, he offered his community room for my book club!
5782 So nice, very friendly, definitely the kind of place we want to encourage.
5783 The best gluten free pizza!!
5784 Absolutely loved the avacado pizza.
5785 So delicious.
5786 The wait staff was great, very friendly and invited us to a wine tasting while we waited.
5787 Parking is limited, but certainly not an issue to complain about.
5788 The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.
5789 You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.
5790 The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.
5791 The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...
5792 I won't be returning to this location.
5793 I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim, Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom.
5794 Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night.
5795 The best food I have found the area and the price is right.
5796 You get so much food you have to take home.
5797 Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.
5798 Priced just right.
5799 I love breweries and I love Four Peaks.
5800 One of e best breweries in Az.
5801 We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table.
5802 This place is huge and packed but still room to move around.
5803 We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer!
5804 I've been here a few time and always had a good experience.
5805 I can't wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st!!
5806 !
5807 Cold, under done chips.
5808 If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.
5809 I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having.
5810 Every table had chips and salsa on it.
5811 Sombreros were used as the server platters.
5812 Senor I don't think this even meets health code.
5813 Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called "fandito."
5814 I can't think of a less inspired dish.
5815 It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.
5816 I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.
5817 Great service by Angela and their Doc
5818 First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact
5819 Very enjoyable experience and very quick
5820 Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away
5821 Definitely recommend
5822 My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.
5823 The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.
5824 The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.
5825 We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.
5826 All were exceptional!
5827 As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.
5828 (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)
5829 Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.
5830 For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.
5831 All were fantastic.
5832 The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.
5833 Can't wait until we head back.
5834 Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture.
5835 That may be true in some aspect, however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States.
5836 So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations.
5837 The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old.
5838 Very new to the park scene for this metro, I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time.
5839 That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.
5840 The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all.
5841 The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream, several waterfalls, coy fish, and many species of plants.
5842 I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece.
5843 This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore.
5844 I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries.
5845 He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones.
5846 Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you.
5847 I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A.
5848 for the first time the other day.
5849 She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line.
5850 I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath!
5851 So I was really pleased.
5852 This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family.
5853 They make your children feel comfortable too.
5854 There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch.
5855 The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby.
5856 They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment!
5857 I highly recommend this office.
5858 Best prices and a huge selection.
5859 I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer.
5860 Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.
5861 This is the old location.
5862 For current reviews, look up Karen's Kreamery Cafe'.
5863 Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance.
5864 I do not know the owners, I just love supporting a good, local business...
5865 Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN!
5866 The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way).
5867 The prices are reasonable.
5868 I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonald's prices and less than Cold Stone prices.
5869 If you haven't been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids.
5870 There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground.
5871 Karen's Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility.
5872 There is also a medium sized skate park.
5873 We usually make a fun outing out it.
5874 My family loves this place!!
5875 Support local businesses!!
5876 !
5877 All around great food.
5878 True Texas brisket experience.
5879 Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.
5880 Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!
5881 I'll be back.
5882 ***Read another review on here talking about wings.
5883 They don't have wings here!!
5884 Get your reviews right people.
5885 This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.
5886 I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.
5887 The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG.
5888 Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.
5889 This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice.
5890 I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile.
5891 When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.
5892 When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, "Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican" and walked off.
5893 What?!?
5894 !
5895 The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction.
5896 I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no.
5897 Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.
5898 I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it.
5899 Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...
5900 I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.
5901 Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.
5902 If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.
5903 I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it.
5904 Sadly disappointed.
5905 I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.
5906 I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.
5907 For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.
5908 The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just "so so."
5909 The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked, but it was a very unique and cool environment.
5910 I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there, even though the prices are higher than Safeway.
5911 Why?
5912 -The staff rocks.
5913 Need a certain type of wine?
5914 They know where to find it.
5915 Need a spice?
5916 That's covered too.
5917 Every employee is courteous, and most importantly, SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.
5918 -Their deli rocks my socks.
5919 Always fresh and always tasty, I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.
5920 -The ready to cook stuff is delicious too.
5921 In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese?
5922 This is the place.
5923 -I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store.
5924 From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets, the choices are a plenty.
5925 Again, not cheap, but you certainly get your money's worth.
5926 Go early if you want the breakfast, they run out quick.
5927 And you can buy good beer by the bottle!
5928 Dogfish Head rocks.
5929 Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice!
5930 I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.
5931 I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.
5932 Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.
5933 Great decor.
5934 Great food and very good service.
5935 You have to try the pork belly pastrami.
5936 To die for!
5937 Their version of the Manhattan was very good.
5938 As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck.
5939 For dessert go with the black & tan pudding.
5940 Oh soooo good.
5941 Highly recommend this place.
5942 Ditto what Kristi M. said.
5943 Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place.
5944 Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.
5945 This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.
5946 Plan accordingly.
5947 Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.
5948 You will be happy you did.
5949 All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied.
5950 Wow this place is fabulous.
5951 Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.
5952 The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.
5953 Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.
5954 Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.
5955 You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.
5956 They need to open locations in the Midwest.
5957 Also, I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.
5958 His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.
5959 He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!
5960 Always love the ALofts
5961 If you've stayed at one, they're pretty much the same
5962 Rooms were clean and comfortable.
5963 There was plenty of room in the standard king room
5964 Bathroom was nice, you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos, they're in the wall mounted containers, which is nice.
5965 Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board, but other than that, the room was perfect, especially if you like hip, modern decor, which I do.
5966 Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA, but not quite as roomy.
5967 The rest of the property was just OK, yes, they have a lounge, but need a restaurant.
5968 This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do.
5969 All in all though, probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area, especially for the price.
5970 I heard from the bartender that the one in Tempe is more live than this one.
5971 I have always loved this place.
5972 Good Food, fair price,  and typically a couple of cute girls working there.
5973 All around good place..   its a go to .
5974 Sanctuary you've been replaced.
5975 Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.
5976 Loved.
5977 Loved.
5978 the service.
5979 Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.
5980 Loved the waterfall treatment.
5981 Loved private rooftop pool.
5982 Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.
5983 Loved the fitness classes, the facility.
5984 All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.
5985 The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!
5986 I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!
5987 This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town.
5988 She's reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind.
5989 She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion!
5990 When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint "ornament" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.
5991 Never had a vet do anything so kind.
5992 We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.
5993 I know a good vet.
5994 Go here.
5995 Please go here!
5996 probably my favorite restaurant :)
5997 This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd.
5998 I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT!
5999 Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
6000 This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k.
6001 if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.
6002 Heck yeah it was o.k.
6003 in fact I don't even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!
6004 My buddy and I decided to start with an app.
6005 order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.
6006 Delightful!
6007 I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.
6008 Notice the sweet potato theme??
6009 I love those crazy orange taters!
6010 The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.
6011 The burger was a little different than I expected because it didn't come on a bun..but no biggie.
6012 In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin' good!
6013 I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!
6014 Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.
6015 The prices for those condos located upstairs..well that's gotta be a different story!
6016 If you don't love Guissepe's, you don't love Italian.
6017 Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland, unseasoned, frozen-then/microwaved meats, sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an "endless" pasta and salad bar.
6018 Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.
6019 It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine.
6020 Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much.
6021 Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork.
6022 Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be.
6023 Leave your dietary worries at home.
6024  In a word: perfecto.
6025 Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled.
6026 He is without peer in the state of Arizona.
6027 But be warned... there ain't no endless pasta bowl here.
6028 Their weekday lunches are equally superior.
6029 This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey.
6030 BEAUTIFUL!
6031 Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.
6032 A few tips:
6033 1.
6034 Get there before 6pm.
6035 The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want.
6036 2.
6037 Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners.
6038 Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious.
6039 3.
6040 If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket.
6041 It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.
6042 There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.
6043 Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.
6044 It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.
6045 You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.
6046 Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.
6047 The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out.
6048 We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!!
6049 They were everywhere, on us, our food, the other customers - and this was inside.
6050 The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.
6051 Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place, it looks nice but the food is so-so.
6052 I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars...
6053 Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.
6054 Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.
6055 My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!
6056 !
6057 We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport.
6058 I pulled out my iPad and 'yelped' ice cream.
6059 It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away.
6060 As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.
6061 So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.
6062 It wasn't luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.
6063 Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well.
6064 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!
6065 We all enjoyed our selections.
6066 One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.
6067 The fruity crunch they added was delish!
6068 Yogurtland was a home run!
6069 Thanks For the Yelp!
6070 Great product!
6071 I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find.
6072 Organic, whole, raw milk -  this certainly did the trick!
6073 We'll be going back that's for sure!
6074 I've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately, but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.
6075 Movies on Central RULES.
6076 They have 99.9% of every movie title we've looked for.
6077 Since summer started, we've been in there at least once a week.
6078 Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.
6079 Sweet!
6080 I can't believe it took me this long to visit Sportsman's but now that I have, I know I'll be making my way back soon enough!
6081 Sportman's is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits, wine, champagne and beer galore.
6082 Plus it's locally owned by the Basha's family!
6083 I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol.
6084 The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol.
6085 The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars!
6086 It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here.
6087 Since it's the holiday season, they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift!
6088 I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping.
6089 They also make customized gift baskets!
6090 Great views, great food, great service and great atmosphere!
6091 We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldn't believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35!
6092 The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!
6093 I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead.
6094 I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike.
6095 I could definitely tell the bike was riding better, smoother, more efficient.
6096 They even re-installed my bike computer, threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly.
6097 I definitely recommend this place.
6098 Oh, and the food is good, too!
6099 Great food and even better beer.
6100 Staff are always friendly.
6101 My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.
6102 After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's.
6103 So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE!
6104 I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint!
6105 Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette.
6106 If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled.
6107 DELICIOUSNESS!
6108 It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!
6109 I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce.
6110 WOOHOO!
6111 FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!
6112 Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight!
6113 Bon Appetite
6114 I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.
6115 I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.
6116 We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out.
6117 Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!
6118 Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!
6119 I didn't taste one that I didn't like.
6120 Liberty Market was my fave I think.
6121 Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!
6122 YUM!!!
6123 Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!
6124 I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch.
6125 I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.
6126 And everyone was so nice!
6127 $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!
6128 And it was for two very worthy causes.
6129 Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.
6130 There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.
6131 So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.
6132 People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.
6133 I appreciate that.
6134 And best of all my daughter had a great time!
6135 There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.
6136 Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.
6137 It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!
6138 Will I be back next year?
6139 You bet!!
6140 And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!
6141 Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.
6142 And now, I am, too.
6143 She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.
6144 The first time, it was the Thai chicken salad, which I loved.
6145 Today, we had two salads and a sandwich tray.
6146 I don't even like sandwiches.
6147 I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.
6148 Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said "OMG!
6149 This is so good!"
6150 It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.
6151 My friend seated directly to my left said, "Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch."
6152 They were truly that good.
6153 The salads were both great, too.
6154 I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future.
6155 I don't know what I would do if this store ever closed.
6156 It's right near our home, has an excellent selection of both wine, meats, and produce.
6157 Note that wine is mentioned first...
6158 I can't help it!
6159 The service is always really good too.
6160 Everyone who works here seems like they really love their job.
6161 The only issue I have ever had was not being able to get basil a couple of times.
6162 I got over it.
6163 :D
6164 I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David.
6165 $13 always gets me the cut I want.
6166 I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted.
6167 Now I never have to worry about that.
6168 So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try.
6169 Cheers!
6170 My van broke down and I needed a tow real fast because I had my kids with me in the heat.
6171 I looked up towing on my phone and just happened to pick Leyva's.
6172 I am so glad I did.
6173 I spoke with Chris and he was very nice and helpful.
6174 The driver was there within 20 minutes and was also so, so nice to me and my kids.
6175 He was very clean and professional and courteous.
6176 The whole experience was better than I have every had with a towing company.
6177 I keep their card in my wallet now and gladly refer them.
6178 Delicious food, amazing martini's, and wonderful desserts.
6179 Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome.
6180 First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas.
6181 You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in.
6182 Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things.
6183 The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch.
6184 The same is true with the mozzarella.
6185 The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect.
6186 As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful.
6187 The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu.
6188 I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others.
6189 Finally, desert has always been good.
6190 Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly won't be disappointed.
6191 Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.
6192 I love Chipotle!
6193 A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa.
6194 Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to!
6195 I had a facial and a massage.
6196 In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff!
6197 They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it.
6198 An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked!
6199 They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy.
6200 Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness.
6201 It was awesome!
6202 AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley.
6203 Check it out if you can!
6204 Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.
6205 Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..
6206 Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups.
6207 Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one.
6208 Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.
6209 Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident..
6210 He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door.
6211 Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing .
6212 But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..
6213 Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later..
6214 They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. "I'm a wishful thinker"
6215 Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by "place was trashed" I go back up and ask the guy for our order..
6216 He said", oh sorry forgot" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel..
6217 He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them.
6218 Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.
6219 Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..
6220 Short list
6221 -employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND..
6222 Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves.
6223 This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.
6224 So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible.
6225 Freaking DISGUSTING.
6226 But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands..
6227 This happens no less than 10 times..
6228 Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what?
6229 Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom.
6230 could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate.
6231 His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.
6232 Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point.
6233 At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much.
6234 He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish.
6235 He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up.
6236 I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place.
6237 I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment.
6238 In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location.
6239 I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.
6240 I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns.
6241 If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.
6242 -Thanks for reading this little novel.
6243 We live by and love this place!
6244 Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck!
6245 Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
6246 Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche I've ever tasted in AZ.
6247 Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality.
6248 I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco.
6249 If I'm in the area I make it a point to visit.
6250 Rude, rude, rude.
6251 I will *never* go back to this place.
6252 I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks).
6253 When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me "we have signs everywhere."
6254 The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say.
6255 Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY).
6256 I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever.
6257 I won't ever go there again.
6258 Steer clear.
6259 The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers.
6260 With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.
6261 Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.
6262 As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later).
6263 As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously.
6264 We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts.
6265 We ordered food...
6266 The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care.
6267 I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish.
6268 If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine.
6269 I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set.
6270 Surreal.
6271 .. .
6272 .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back.
6273 Good: Cheap Drinks !!!
6274 !
6275 Bad: You may be stabbed!!
6276 !
6277 What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years.
6278 I can see why.
6279 Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful.
6280 Of course all that matters is the food, right - and it's marvelous.
6281 We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful.
6282 Highly recommended.
6283 My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh.
6284 my goodness!
6285 It is AMAZING!
6286 The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness.
6287 I think she bought a Groupon and I don't know how much she paid but the pie was so good, regardless of full price, I'm sure it's worth it!
6288 The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine.
6289 China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal.
6290 This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.
6291 They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes.
6292 And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles).
6293 There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.
6294 If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list.
6295 the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.
6296 Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.
6297 The people at Flemings were wonderful.
6298 They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening.
6299 Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic!
6300 great food...
6301 HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)...
6302 I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there.
6303 Very delicious food without long waits!
6304 The staff is very friendly and accommodating.
6305 I look forward to going back.
6306 One word: PISTACHIO...
6307 in all its glory...
6308 no need to say more.
6309 When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) "a kid in a candy store."
6310 It's is a true one of a kind store, it's so entertaining to just walk around in.
6311 The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun!
6312 The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!
6313 ), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!
6314 ), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic!
6315 Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy.
6316 My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second).
6317 Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!
6318 Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol
6319 Honestly my lunch was just okay
6320 Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
6321 Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype
6322 But, I am supposed to be honest.
6323 This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside.
6324 My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz.
6325 We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch.
6326 Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street.
6327 I mean it is biker week.
6328 The people watching would've been stellar.
6329 The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio.
6330 But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.
6331 The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with.
6332 I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction.
6333 A coworker got the stigmata.
6334 Holy strong... and not in a good way.
6335 I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it.
6336 One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon.
6337 That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table.
6338 What happened to the contents do you ask?
6339 That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face.
6340 The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all.
6341 No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.
6342 The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad.
6343 I did enjoy those.
6344 I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries.
6345 Cute silver bucket.
6346 Tons of fries.
6347 Couldn't finish.
6348 I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it.
6349 Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily.
6350 I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast.
6351 Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious.
6352 They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10.
6353 Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish.
6354 Just sayin'.
6355 I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.
6356 So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad.
6357 The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point.
6358 I do admit I loved the bread.
6359 It was delicious.
6360 I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard.
6361 Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup.
6362 I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops.
6363 What I paid for this was ridiculous.
6364 The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
6365 The food was meh.
6366 Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
6367 It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience.
6368 Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.
6369 One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again.
6370 I told him maybe.
6371 Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!
6372 This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's.
6373 Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos.
6374 The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time.
6375 This visit was no exception.
6376 Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well.
6377 I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.
6378 It's one of few places I go to with "stuff" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.
6379 Keep up the good work.
6380 Excellent brunch food and great Bloody Marys!
6381 They make their own bread onsite, which is to die for!
6382 Love it.
6383 Hate the valet parking.
6384 Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger.
6385 Service was top rate.
6386 Visited this restaurant last week with a groupon special, not expecting their best service since I was using a coupon.
6387 I was pleasantly surprised on how great the service was!
6388 Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour!
6389 Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy!
6390 I'll definitely be returning :)
6391 This is the most comfortable place to have a glass of wine, relax, and enjoy some great food.
6392 Their service is amazing.
6393 There are really comfy seats and couches inside and great outdoor seating.
6394 You could literally spend hours here.
6395 They have wi-fi, so you can chill out on your CPU or IPad.
6396 The bar super cool.
6397 Very nice bartenders that are knowledgable and accommodating.
6398 Their wine is killer, of course, or they wouldn't be named 5th and Wine right?
6399 Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes!
6400 The food has always been amazing!
6401 I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.
6402 Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy!
6403 Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus!
6404 I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all!
6405 Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered.
6406 My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA!
6407 Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously!
6408 Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish!
6409 The lavosh pita crisp!
6410 Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp!
6411 Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!
6412 The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.
6413 The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.
6414 I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.
6415 Never to be back
6416 I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan.
6417 I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick.
6418 I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything.
6419 I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks.
6420 Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me.
6421 I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!
6422 !
6423 The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawai'i!
6424 Lots of flavoring options, and a cheap date!
6425 Haven't tried the smoothies yet, but we heard they're great!
6426 By far my favorite restaurant in valley.
6427 Deliciously spicey.
6428 A bit pricey if you're picking and choosing items but they're complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck.
6429 Not actually sure about the service as I've only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome.
6430 Hands down, the best breakfast I've had in Tempe/Phoenix.
6431 We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table.
6432 The service was friendly and attentive.
6433 A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen (e.g.
6434 bringing someone's toast), but our waitress was great.
6435 Everyone in our party loved their food.
6436 I had the Vatican skillet (which we still can't figure out why it's called the Vatican...?)
6437 and blueberry pancakes.
6438 Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito.
6439 All of the food was awesome.
6440 And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert.
6441 Oh.
6442 My.
6443 God.
6444 I don't even have the words to describe it.
6445 At least not words that are appropriate for yelp.
6446 It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant.
6447 I'll be back.
6448 Not soon enough.
6449 Absolutely loved this place!
6450 My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement.
6451 My fiance had found it on yelp and said "we must go there for lunch one day" while we were there.
6452 We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a "higher end" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy.
6453 The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great!
6454 It was so good, we went back the next day!
6455 This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat.
6456 They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too.
6457 The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection.
6458 The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
6459 Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street.
6460 Inexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant.
6461 My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy.
6462 Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious.
6463 I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )
6464 This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.
6465 They serve beer too.
6466 Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.
6467 Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.
6468 My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant!
6469 Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food, the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca.
6470 We have always encountered friendly, welcoming staff and amazing, fulfilling food.
6471 What more could you ask for?
6472 !
6473 Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea.
6474 Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.
6475 Best Steak Ever.
6476 That is all.
6477 Everything on the menu is amazing.
6478 Go now.
6479 in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review.
6480 this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party.
6481 a real rager.
6482 if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning.
6483 it's a great sports bar.
6484 the weirdest thing about majerles is their name.
6485 someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced "mah jer lees" like i had thought.... it's pronounced "mar lees".
6486 so let me get that out first.
6487 i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that.
6488 i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports.
6489 i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it.
6490 unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc.
6491 being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars.
6492 there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion.
6493 let me lay them out for you:
6494 a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades.
6495 large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.
6496 (mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious.
6497 WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar?
6498 haha!)
6499 also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders.
6500 yum.
6501 the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy.
6502 every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it).
6503 bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize.
6504 happy bartender =  happy bar patrons
6505 the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep.
6506 they designed this with real sports fans in mind.
6507 no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view.
6508 so they have it all, and i likey.
6509 go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter.
6510 oh, and GO PACK GO!!
6511 !
6512 Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab.
6513 I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what.
6514 Then they over charged us by quit a bit.
6515 We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water.
6516 And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long.
6517 There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis.
6518 No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager.
6519 He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check.
6520 Kind of a joke really.
6521 Excellent service!!!!
6522 I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place!
6523 I was SO HAPPY!!
6524 clean, pleasant, warm, comforting.
6525 The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa!
6526 The staff is friendly and efficient!
6527 Lavenders day spa can learn from this place.
6528 Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES.
6529 I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!!
6530 Go and enjoy!!
6531 !
6532 I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times!
6533 I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great.
6534 I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here.
6535 I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way).
6536 It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work.
6537 I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch.
6538 Everything is delicious, but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!
6539 Quick update for Mama Java's since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week... we lucked out and were able to take over the couch / chairs to the right when you walk in the door.
6540 It worked out perfectly!
6541 Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months, Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible!
6542 I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte!
6543 I did, and it was just as good as last time!
6544 The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go, chat, etc...
6545 I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome.
6546 Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit!
6547 Looking forward to the next time...
6548 Lastly, MJ created a yelper special of the day... the "hold me closer tiny yelper' which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte.
6549 Now if that didn't make us feel special, what does?
6550 !
6551 This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere.
6552 It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait?
6553 Yeah,I'm done here.
6554 It's been a while since I was in Arizona, but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.
6555 I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.
6556 We were not disappointed.
6557 Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.
6558 We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.
6559 The staff were professional, welcoming and accommodating.
6560 I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.
6561 Both times I was extremely pleased with the food, drink, level of service and the ambience of the place.
6562 5-stars for mine.
6563 Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.
6564 Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.
6565 Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious.
6566 Atmosphere was cozy.
6567 If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place.
6568 I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done, it was fabulous.
6569 Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage.
6570 She does really job.
6571 The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her.
6572 I will Go back and ask for her...
6573 I just had the ice cream.
6574 That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream.
6575 It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked.
6576 There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously "cute"  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show.
6577 Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse.
6578 Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day.
6579 This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!!
6580 I love the $5 wine glasses during happy hour!!
6581 The bruschetta is out of this world!!
6582 The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!!
6583 :o)
6584 The food in this place is indescribably awesome!
6585 Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it.
6586 The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge.
6587 I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home.
6588 I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken.
6589 Their black beans are to die!
6590 Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here.
6591 You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!
6592 everything, everyone has posted about this company is true!
6593 great service, friendly people, good pricing!
6594 highly recommend!
6595 I don't love the coffee at Starbucks, but this place is getting 5 stars for their service!
6596 They are quick, ACCURATE, friendly, and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week!
6597 Amazing!
6598 The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little "Good Job" on Yelp!
6599 This place was incredible.
6600 The staff was friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable.
6601 I don't know what it was called, but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it.
6602 So fresh!
6603 We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top.
6604 Try the sake that they recommend (flown in from Japan - they are the only ones in PHX that carry it).
6605 I'm not a sake fan but I loved it.
6606 That's how good it was.
6607 Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.
6608 Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.
6609 I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.
6610 Never got sick of it.
6611 It's a dive bar, but it's a cool dive bar.
6612 We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.
6613 The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.
6614 Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.
6615 My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good, no lingering smoke.
6616 We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.
6617 We will come back next time we visit, I wish we had something like this in LA.
6618 If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you.
6619 The food isn't impressive.
6620 Nice outdoor seating.
6621 Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?
6622 Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.
6623 Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it.
6624 If you love to cook (and I do, I really do!)
6625 you can seriously spend hours here.
6626 ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.
6627 Last week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.
6628 If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice.
6629 Go!
6630 Now!
6631 And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached.
6632 This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area.
6633 The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable.
6634 My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago, and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet.
6635 The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree), but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed.
6636 If you like American or French food (who doesn't?)
6637 and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different, I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!
6638 Dropped into this joint just wandering around Old Town Scottsdale.
6639 Ordered the nachos and had a couple margs.
6640 WOW.
6641 The staff was friendly, have a great sense of humor (you gotta see the posted picture joke in person), and the food is...beyond good.
6642 Having only sampled the uber nacho plate, which is by the way, as big as a platter and slathered in layers of ooey gooey cheesy goodness, I can definitively say:
6643 Best.
6644 Ever.
6645 I give this place the highest marks for "doesn't suck"
6646 If you ever want to instantly "up" your cool factor with a friend or date, meet them at the Lost Leaf.
6647 The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky "open" sign indicating that it is, indeed, the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside.
6648 When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before, it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen.
6649 No cocktails or draft, but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection, lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix.
6650 This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.
6651 There, I wrote it...and I am sticking to it.
6652 First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website.
6653 Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find.
6654 Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm.
6655 It's time to make new demands!
6656 It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress.
6657 We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person.
6658 First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing.
6659 Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different?
6660 Not often.
6661 Ultimately we each tried 10 different items.
6662 And each item, was amazing.
6663 I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet.
6664 The service was ideal.
6665 If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here.
6666 I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California.
6667 I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it?
6668 When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me.
6669 The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy.
6670 Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free...
6671 Matt's was absolutely fantastic.
6672 Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less.
6673 Brilliant.
6674 I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had.
6675 Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll.
6676 By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary.
6677 A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.
6678 The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal.
6679 Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated.
6680 Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike.
6681 The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.
6682 I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was.
6683 Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience.
6684 Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21.
6685 Absolutely worth every penny.
6686 Will be coming back.
6687 Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!
6688 This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!
6689 Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!
6690 I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!
6691 Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!
6692 It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!
6693 The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!
6694 I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!
6695 Wonderful food!
6696 Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!
6697 I love the place.
6698 Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.
6699 They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare.
6700 I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.
6701 And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).
6702 Then Crudo disappeared.
6703 And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.
6704 Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.
6705 Oh joy.
6706 BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ!
6707 No but seriously, I could eat every meal here.
6708 Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint.
6709 I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes.
6710 Ok, so you're probably saying "with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?"
6711 Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde?
6712 Yes please!!)
6713 but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious.
6714 The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture.
6715 The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words.
6716 Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning.
6717 I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to.
6718 This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.
6719 The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill.
6720 The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go.
6721 Love the Herb Box and can't wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.
6722 This review can be applied to any and all Quick Trip locations.
6723 I have, on many occasions, gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations, because not only are they much much nicer, but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare (drinks, shakes, coffees, juices, snacks, etc).
6724 I really appreciate how quickly they work, with cashier's that are able to take care of two customers at once.
6725 I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because, let's face it, we've all been there and seen how putrid they can be, but whenever I visit QT they are always clean!
6726 They mop, sweep, clean the bathrooms, windex the doors...and for that I applaud you all, thanks for the cleanliness:D
6727 What a place!
6728 I recently hosted a 25-person family party there, and both the food and service were impeccable.
6729 The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, even with the dozen children we had in the group.
6730 Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail, helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.
6731 The restaurant itself was spotless, from the outside patio down to the restrooms.
6732 Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.
6733 Everyone left full and happy.
6734 We will definitely be back!
6735 !
6736 Oh my God, Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!
6737 While this location has a steady customer base, I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated, unlike the other location at 92nd Street, Win!
6738 Service has always been fantastic.
6739 Quick on to seat, quick to get drinks, quick on refills, and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items.
6740 As other reviewers have stated, the Jewish sliders are amazing, but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches.
6741 Prices are a little higher, but the food is well worth the money.
6742 There is a "bar area" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on.
6743 The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme, well lit, but the acoustics aren't that great so it can get a little noisy.
6744 Bathrooms are nice and always clean.
6745 Oh, and don't forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home!
6746 Great sushi place!
6747 Ample portions of sashimi.
6748 Unagi is the best I've had.
6749 And don't forget the Tako salad.
6750 The atmosphere is okay.
6751 It's not bad, but not exactly cool.
6752 Of course, if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale), you'd never get a table.
6753 Careful!
6754 You'll get addicted.
6755 Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.
6756 The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for.
6757 Don't settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!
6758 I can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday!
6759 Talk about a hidden gem!
6760 I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her "List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.
6761 Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up.
6762 As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.
6763 We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.
6764 The food was delicious and the hookah was great!
6765 The staff was awesome the entire night as well.
6766 Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.
6767 One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!
6768 I definitely love that they're open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because it's always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!
6769 This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area.
6770 Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion?
6771 The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location, just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared.
6772 My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona.
6773 I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.
6774 It was a rainy Sunday.
6775 I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by).
6776 I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said "Ben?"
6777 as I was about to pass by again.
6778 I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.
6779 I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound.
6780 I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us.
6781 I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal.
6782 Next up was the trout.
6783 It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate.
6784 The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last.
6785 I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away.
6786 For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote.
6787 FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately.
6788 It's well deserved.
6789 If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out.
6790 Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat.
6791 then i got a new tech to finish my pedi.
6792 my total was different than the quoted price.
6793 when paying my total was $25 i hanede them a $50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip.
6794 he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen.
6795 My feet were so dry afterwards.
6796 I DO NOT recommend them
6797 So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds.
6798 I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay.
6799 In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google "best donuts" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up.
6800 They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were.
6801 So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale!
6802 I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop.
6803 Boy was I wrong!
6804 Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever!
6805 I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself.
6806 I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven.
6807 The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for.
6808 What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops.
6809 (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!)
6810 Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside.
6811 The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake.
6812 It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work.
6813 I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too.
6814 They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too.
6815 If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!
6816 Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food.
6817 Try the Orange Blossom!
6818 !
6819 YUM!
6820 I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!
6821 It will change your life!
6822 My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.
6823 Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.
6824 Their bilinis are wonderful as well!
6825 Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned.
6826 Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds).
6827 But this family run restaurant that has been here for years.
6828 Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area.
6829 A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.
6830 Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side.
6831 All entrees come with soup or salad.
6832 Yelpers,  have a question.
6833 If menus and prices vary by location, help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try!
6834 Thanks, I've heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet, CA ones while visiting.
6835 May I add "family friendly" to my past reviews?
6836 We love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here.
6837 The staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms.
6838 The manager, Kaj, literally treats us like family.
6839 We brought our new born baby to Corbin's for her first meal out, and we were thrilled with the level of service we received, as usual.
6840 The food is excellent, and the service is divine.
6841 The happy hour is awesome!
6842 My favorite items are the quesedillas, burgers, feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer, and the excellent selection of beers.
6843 Corbins is just an overall  great place!
6844 I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut.
6845 He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children.
6846 He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX).
6847 It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol!
6848 Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event.
6849 In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
6850 Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding.
6851 I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet, three boutonnieres and two corsages.
6852 I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget.
6853 She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices.
6854 She also did all of this via email.
6855 which I give her total kudos for.
6856 On the day of my wedding, there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents.
6857 Amanda waited for me, even though I was terribly late, to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch.
6858 Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable.
6859 I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved!
6860 I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.
6861 I stopped in for happy hour with some friends, and we had a great time.
6862 We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.
6863 The location alone is worth going for, but the food was good and service was even better.
6864 I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.
6865 I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.
6866 I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.
6867 I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.
6868 By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.
6869 I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.
6870 Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.
6871 To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.
6872 I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.
6873 However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store.
6874 I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.
6875 It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.
6876 It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.
6877 I will definitely shop Zappos next time.
6878 This place has the best wraps I've ever had.
6879 The smoothie's are good as well, but I go here because of the wraps.
6880 I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review.
6881 I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa.
6882 The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others.
6883 You can't go wrong with the donut holes.
6884 Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!
6885 One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :)
6886 I love this place.
6887 Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day.
6888 The food is awesome.
6889 The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching.
6890 The area is definitely lucky to have such a place.
6891 Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.
6892 :
6893 Slow indifferent service
6894 Mediocre food
6895 The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater.
6896 But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants!
6897 So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates.
6898 Yes...
6899 I love Eegee's...
6900 I have to admit it could be a bit of a problem for me as I drove from Chandler to Casa Grande just for an eegee and sammich in the worse rush hour traffic.
6901 If that isn't love I don't know what is because we all know Arizona drivers are ... well you know.
6902 I always get the pina colda mixed with lemon eegee and a grinder / or turkey sub and don't forget the ranch fries!
6903 The one is Casa Grande is new and clean not that I can say the same for the ones in Tucson.
6904 I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.
6905 The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.
6906 However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.
6907 I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.
6908 I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).
6909 The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.
6910 One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, "It happens."
6911 No, sorry that's disgusting.
6912 If i hadn't been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.
6913 And then on top of getting a cricket in my water there's no discount or compensation off of my bill.
6914 I went here with Friends last Friday.
6915 All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.
6916 It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.
6917 Our 1st disappointment came because they had a "limited" beer list.
6918 My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.
6919 Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.
6920 We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.
6921 The Calamari was extremely oily.
6922 The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.
6923 We all came to the conclusion we would never go back.
6924 Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale.
6925 The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint.
6926 Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.
6927 The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience.
6928 I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated.
6929 This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time.
6930 A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.
6931 I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-
6932 Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor.
6933 Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg.
6934 Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good.
6935 We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.
6936 Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts.
6937 This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.
6938 The service we had was phenomenal.
6939 The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking.
6940 The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!
6941 5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink.
6942 but- thats why I love this place.
6943 That, and its near the Trunk Space.
6944 Lux is a great place for coffee, bakery items, bites, and even cocktails if the occasion permits.
6945 The people are friendly, and it has a great atmosphere.
6946 I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano, which is pretty damn top-notch.
6947 As I don't live in AZ, if I'm going to be away for an extended period of time, I'm always sure to take a bag of their freshly-roasted coffee beans from wherever with me.
6948 I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend, and it wasn't too crowded.
6949 The only downside I've experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day.
6950 If you go for the first time, don't be shy.
6951 Grab a cup of coffee and explore.
6952 As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, you might get looks walking in like you shouldn't be there.
6953 Maybe it's your hair.
6954 Maybe you're displaying something that's not eco-friendly.
6955 Whatever, dude.
6956 Be brave, press on.
6957 It's worth it.
6958 I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of.
6959 The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost $3, which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home, but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it.
6960 My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch.
6961 I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good.
6962 (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there.
6963 My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals.
6964 I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas.
6965 One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada.
6966 It was SO delicious!
6967 The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other.
6968 My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it.
6969 My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those.
6970 And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were.
6971 And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada.
6972 Our server was named Travis and he was great as well.
6973 Phenomenal service.
6974 Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is.
6975 This place is excellent.
6976 Hands down, the best tacos I've had.
6977 Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.
6978 I see people raving about some of the "salsa bars" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.
6979 They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft.
6980 If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas.
6981 I totally love this place.
6982 It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D
6983 The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix.
6984 The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more.
6985 The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate.
6986 The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.
6987 The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive.
6988 The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably.
6989 We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too).
6990 Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice.
6991 The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey.
6992 I could have eaten 100 of them!
6993 Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34!
6994 My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers.
6995 Highly recommended.
6996 Do it!
6997 DO IT!
6998 OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE!
6999 I should have read the reviews before I came here!
7000 I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much.
7001 I asked her, how much will this cost?
7002 She assured me it would not be "much".
7003 It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there.
7004 I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO!
7005 She said it's because the dress cost more.
7006 Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair.
7007 I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!
7008 Previously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it.
7009 They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand.
7010 Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!
7011 !
7012 Great prices and service.
7013 The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong.
7014 High quality furniture and very low prices.
7015 I have been going here for years.
7016 The staff is always very pleasant, the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.
7017 I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.
7018 Overall, a top notch establishment.
7019 I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.
7020 I will never go anywhere else.
7021 My hair always looks amazing when I leave.
7022 The color and cut are always perfect!
7023 I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.
7024 First class salon!
7025 Beautiful surroundings!
7026 Always great service!
7027 They aim to please!
7028 Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!
7029 Thanks everyone!
7030 Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell.
7031 You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage?
7032 Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods.
7033 It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.
7034 It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here.
7035 Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce.
7036 Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix.
7037 I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.
7038 When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello.
7039 Deep down you know they hate this.
7040 Why are we in the kitchen?
7041 Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good.
7042 Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good.
7043 It's just dead.
7044 Dead food.
7045 No life, no flavor, not emotion.
7046 I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.
7047 Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste.
7048 Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility.
7049 No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste.
7050 Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity.
7051 Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.
7052 Just did take out.
7053 Great experience.
7054 Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.
7055 Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.
7056 Made it an in and out operation.
7057 Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.
7058 My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.
7059 I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.
7060 I highly recommend it.
7061 As a previous reviewer stated:  "This restaurant is like no other".
7062 We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.
7063 First of all, the service is second to none.
7064 Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.
7065 They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.
7066 You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.
7067 Now for the food - fantastic!
7068 I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.
7069 My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.
7070 But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.
7071 For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.
7072 They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry "shooters" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).
7073 Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.
7074 As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.
7075 For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.
7076 Fantastic!
7077 We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.
7078 The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.
7079 I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!
7080 I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to.
7081 My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.
7082 The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.
7083 I drink my beer and want another.
7084 The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.
7085 I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.
7086 The dude is just ignoring me at this point.
7087 I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.
7088 He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip...
7089 I just want out of here.
7090 I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.
7091 I hope he spends it well.
7092 On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.
7093 It's not any better than the service sadly.
7094 I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.
7095 Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.
7096 Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.
7097 Avoid at all cost.
7098 I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.
7099 Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.
7100 Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.
7101 Get rid of these people already... just sad!
7102 !
7103 Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.
7104 I am Chinese from northern China.
7105 This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.
7106 Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.
7107 Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.
7108 Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.
7109 Owners are very nice.
7110 Much more organized than the last time I was there, and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask.
7111 The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for!!!
7112 They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 6.50 a pop!!
7113 Still MUCH cheaper that the 11$ everywhere else.
7114 No striping tape!!!
7115 Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didn't sell well......
7116 I just went down the street and got some...:)) yay candy cane nails!!
7117 !
7118 Stopped by here for lunch today...
7119 I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out.
7120 WOW!!
7121 This place is amazing.
7122 The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly.
7123 I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber.
7124 I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away!
7125 BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!
7126 Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda.
7127 It was so amazing I went back for dinner.
7128 I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it.
7129 I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life.
7130 My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties.
7131 roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries.
7132 I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good.
7133 His was so good he ordered another burger.
7134 For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for.
7135 I really think I need one of these every night.
7136 From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit.
7137 This is a must go!
7138 This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini's they serve here.
7139 We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich.
7140 Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:
7141 Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.
7142 Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless.
7143 Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it.
7144 As it is small
7145 in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.
7146 Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.
7147 recommended Food:
7148 Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.
7149 Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
7150 meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.
7151 Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.
7152 Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.
7153 Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf.
7154 The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion.
7155 I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.
7156 Appetizers: ?/?
7157 I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest.
7158 I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.
7159 Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz.
7160 I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it.
7161 D-scust-ing.
7162 I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
7163 I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (it's the # 43) is my favorite!
7164 It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!
7165 The bread is always soft and fresh, it is extremely filling because it's stuffed full of steak, peppers, and cheese!!!!
7166 To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chili's to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!
7167 !
7168 Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...
7169 Here was how this played out.
7170 Oktoberfest a few days ago.
7171 Starting the night off.
7172 I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.
7173 Good, right?
7174 No.
7175 me: "Hi, one slice of pizza please"
7176 guy: "you buy drink with it, 4 dollars."
7177 me: "no, just one slice of pizza"
7178 guy: "we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.
7179 4 dollars"
7180 I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me.
7181 Not a wise move.
7182 me: "so, I can't buy one slice?"
7183 guy: "no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars."
7184 me: "It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls"
7185 guy: "No, do not sell one slice.
7186 me: "what the...
7187 O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza"
7188 guy: "you buy two slices then."
7189 me: "yes, Jesus Christ, yes"
7190 guy: "toppings?"
7191 me: "no, no toppings.
7192 cheese."
7193 guy: "we have toppings."
7194 what is this guy, fucking deaf?
7195 me: "no thanks"
7196 I give him the money.
7197 guy: "it take 10 minutes, you wait."
7198 I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.
7199 Pizza comes out.
7200 Tastes like absolute crap.
7201 I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.
7202 I think they had the thermostat set to "HELL" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.
7203 I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.
7204 Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.
7205 However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.
7206 I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.
7207 Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.
7208 I'd keep walking.
7209 FAIL.
7210 I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again.
7211 Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.
7212 if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.
7213 If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).
7214 Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a "Rock" bread on their sandwiches.
7215 The mac n' cheese was nothing special.
7216 The service was beyond poor.
7217 First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.
7218 Great food.
7219 Great ambiance.
7220 Great for a night date on the patio.
7221 I can't wait to go again.
7222 You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head?
7223 Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.
7224 Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!
7225 !
7226 I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.
7227 The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!
7228 The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.
7229 The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.
7230 Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.
7231 You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.
7232 They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.
7233 Jeremiah is great!
7234 He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing!
7235 We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again.
7236 Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste.
7237 For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad.
7238 The sandwich is great.
7239 Loved it.
7240 The house salad...
7241 I mean, I could not stop eating it.
7242 I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING.
7243 I am craving it just thinking about it.
7244 The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual.
7245 I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again.
7246 Mediocre, bland, low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.
7247 I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally "just in case it's gotten better", for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.
7248 The salsa and rice are usually good, but that's the most I have to offer.
7249 I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!
7250 So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!
7251 How great is that?
7252 Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?
7253 I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed.
7254 This arena is super nice, almost mall-like and clean on the inside.
7255 What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena.
7256 Where I'm from, you'd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game.
7257 Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around.
7258 Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger, but other than that.
7259 this arena is right up there.
7260 What a place for brunch.
7261 $4 drinks are fantastic.
7262 Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly.
7263 Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
7264 Fast service.
7265 Great burgers and fries.
7266 So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
7267 Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.
7268 The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that.
7269 My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.
7270 Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.
7271 Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance.
7272 Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots.
7273 The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable.
7274 Tender, juicy, sent from above...having this dish once is not enough.
7275 You won't have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGrath's bowl of deliciousness, any pork dish she's ever prepared seems dry and flavorless.
7276 We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes.
7277 I get them every time.
7278 The filet was the best steak I've ever had (I've thought about it, trust me) and the Dr. Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss "Dr. Love" commercial comes on.
7279 yummmmmmers.
7280 This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesome
7281 and of the good "Homemade" quality.
7282 Known the family for almost 30 yrs now.
7283 ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!!
7284 Amazing location and such a great food !!!
7285 Been going there for a long, long time!
7286 I have yet be even slightly annoyed.
7287 BLISS!
7288 They wait on you hand and foot, food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers!
7289 LOVE them all around!
7290 ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!)
7291 DO IT!!!
7292 GO THERE!!!!!
7293 #1 rest.
7294 per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!
7295 Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.
7296 Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.
7297 Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.
7298 On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion.
7299 Prices are often way too high!
7300 Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich!
7301 Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool.
7302 Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine.
7303 (50 cents, apparently)
7304 I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.
7305 She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.
7306 She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.
7307 Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted.
7308 They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.
7309 They just shrugged their shoulders.
7310 My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.
7311 There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.
7312 There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were "socializing" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion.
7313 The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers).....
7314 So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)
7315 Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.
7316 It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.
7317 What a deal!
7318 Under 5. bucks including the drink.
7319 I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc.
7320 or just about anywhere.
7321 Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe!
7322 The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert!
7323 And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day.
7324 Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly.
7325 Just a really great place to dine!
7326 I love this place.
7327 Every time I visit I come here.
7328 I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(
7329 Talk about one of the best burgers in town...in fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix!!!!
7330 I took one bite and i was in heaven...it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy!!
7331 I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG!!!
7332 I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want to.dip them in...i have to thank.my sister for this place she introduced me!!!
7333 Its a great place to.go for lunch and dinner but it.is not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it!!!
7334 Its a fun place do not miss it...
7335 Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.
7336 She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!
7337 She is caring, and overall great doctor.
7338 She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.
7339 The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN....
7340 After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem.
7341 Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.
7342 This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here!
7343 Only quality sought after items.
7344 Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.
7345 When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.
7346 This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.
7347 There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.
7348 After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.
7349 Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.
7350 If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.
7351 Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby.
7352 I absolutely love Chompies!
7353 It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix.
7354 They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.
7355 They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.
7356 I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food.
7357 The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had.
7358 The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty.
7359 I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.
7360 Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.
7361 Chompies is the best!
7362 This is  the best Asian restaurant in town!
7363 Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life!
7364 The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had.
7365 I honestly crave this dish about twice a week.
7366 Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town!
7367  The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable.
7368 She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard.
7369 I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery.
7370 So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Tottie's!
7371 Best pizza I've had anywhere.
7372 Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.
7373 Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.
7374 Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.
7375 I deeply envy the regulars here.
7376 I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.
7377 They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!
7378 It's always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to.
7379 They also have the best hot sauce in town!
7380 As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.
7381 If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place.
7382 What an awesome neighborhood bar.
7383 I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular.
7384 For entertainment they have pool, darts, games and music.
7385 Our waitress Chris was more than attentive.
7386 I will defiantly be coming back!
7387 unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Ed's!
7388 It's tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale.
7389 Walking towards the front you can't help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers - the flower bed still makes me smile!
7390 Walking through the front door it's easy to forget where and when you are - the wood floors, Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there... ICE CREAM.
7391 good selection and great ice cream..
7392 Now let's talk about ice cream pie... Papa Ed's makes to order (with advance notice) ice cream pies.
7393 I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust.
7394 The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite - Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust!
7395 I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.
7396 The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.
7397 You can usually find what you are looking for here.
7398 The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.
7399 They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!
7400 !
7401 Enjoy
7402 Y'know, rarely do I buy the "extended warranty" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays.
7403 If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer, it should be unnecessary.
7404 In the case of tires, I have to make an exception.
7405 You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares.
7406 They're a nefarious bunch for the most part.
7407 I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway.
7408 For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.
7409 I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow.
7410 The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny.
7411 The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment).
7412 There is even free water for customers.
7413 They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds).
7414 Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait.
7415 In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them.
7416 I prefer getting mine from DT.
7417 Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley!
7418 I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again.
7419 Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there.
7420 Now, eating there I might not suggest, taking the food home is awesome!
7421 Beautiful hotel, great rooms, best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.
7422 Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.
7423 Very understated and clean feeling, yet still over the top luxurious.
7424 I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...
7425 I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!
7426 Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.
7427 I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.
7428 Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.
7429 Sara helped us out and explained our options.
7430 We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc...
7431 It was easy and quick - bonus!
7432 Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!
7433 Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...
7434 I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!
7435 Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK.
7436 Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
7437 Amazing.
7438 Romantic!
7439 Absolute greatness!!
7440 !
7441 Service: friendly
7442 Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this)
7443 Kung pao noodles
7444 Vegan chilli fries
7445 Ambiance - A+
7446 Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo.
7447 Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it.
7448 Equals the case of raw cooked veggies.
7449 Go next door to nami for dessert!
7450 !
7451 Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.
7452 The Stetson chopped was amazing.
7453 The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.
7454 I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.
7455 Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.
7456 This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.
7457 The bread pudding was amazing.
7458 Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.
7459 Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!
7460 ), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)
7461 Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.
7462 I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!
7463 I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.
7464 Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.
7465 Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.
7466 Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.
7467 Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.
7468 I took my wife and kids for lunch.
7469 We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.
7470 The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.
7471 The meat was definately cooked with love.
7472 Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.
7473 They sell bottles of it as well.
7474 I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.
7475 I also noticed they do catering.
7476 I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ.
7477 I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona.
7478 Thanks for making good food Grady.
7479 We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more.
7480 I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer.
7481 Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita.
7482 Although its an app, its large enough for a light meal.
7483 Most times, I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend.
7484 Perfect.
7485 For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad.
7486 The beets are sweet like candy.
7487 Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy.
7488 I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!!
7489 They won't give up the secret sauce!
7490 :(
7491 Enjoy!
7492 I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor.
7493 The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness.
7494 They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless.
7495 It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.
7496 ...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.
7497 Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.
7498 Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation.
7499 The absolute worse service I've encountered.
7500 My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink.
7501 Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food.
7502 By that time, another family sat at our table.
7503 My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi.
7504 Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi.
7505 I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi.
7506 The family on our table were so upset for us as well.
7507 The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed.
7508 I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great.
7509 I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers.
7510 I then gave it another try.
7511 I met my girlfriends there.
7512 We had dinner, spent over $200.
7513 We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about.
7514 We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us.
7515 One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking.
7516 I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern.
7517 Again, food is great service is lousy.
7518 I am so disappointed and will not go back.
7519 I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls.
7520 I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable.
7521 I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites.
7522 A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience.
7523 The Steak Pho is amazing.
7524 Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon!
7525 Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen.
7526 Two thumbs way up!
7527 Food is good to the tummy.
7528 To me this is better than in and out burger.
7529 Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection.
7530 Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.
7531 We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.
7532 We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.
7533 We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.
7534 The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.
7535 The croutons crisp and fresh baked.
7536 We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!!
7537 So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.
7538 The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.
7539 I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.
7540 Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.
7541 Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.
7542 My fav Barbecue chicken salad
7543 no longer has a hint of the same taste.
7544 It should now be called flavor of tomato.
7545  Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country.
7546 Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor.
7547 Im sure many people will love these new changes.
7548 Yet, Im sad it's not the same.
7549 I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich!
7550 No joking!!!!!!!!
7551 !
7552 The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down.
7553 If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.
7554 This place is closed.
7555 Good riddance.
7556 Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night.
7557 You will not be disappointed.
7558 The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.
7559 still a big fan, wonderful pizza!!
7560 !
7561 -- Remember to join their birthday club!!
7562 !-
7563 You like hotdogs?
7564 Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommy's oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!
7565 AND you sissys that like "sonoran" style dogs talking smack about Teds, go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.
7566 This is old style, 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.
7567 Makes my mouth water.
7568 Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.
7569 First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.
7570 The crispy ice berg lettuce, juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover's dream.
7571 Real good home made taste.
7572 So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.
7573 First a warning.
7574 You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.
7575 The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.
7576 Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup "hot sauce" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.
7577 The dilemma you ask?
7578 Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!
7579 Try the Italian for a spicy dog.
7580 Don't start with me on the fries and onion rings.
7581 Just make sure you wear your fat pants.
7582 Motor out and going back for another dog.
7583 i have 2 words for you: passive.
7584 active.
7585 dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isn't smart, it's f'n brilliant.
7586 2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again.
7587 this dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs.
7588 finally, a place where we can all get along.
7589 I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously.
7590 I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness.
7591 As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go.
7592 I walked into a simple yet clean deli.
7593 Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship).
7594 They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine.
7595 Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!
7596 ), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad.
7597 The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week.
7598 He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious.
7599 I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week!
7600 The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too!
7601 The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'!
7602 While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered.
7603 The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven.
7604 It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later.
7605 As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner.
7606 In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out:
7607 - The very friendly staff
7608 - It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary.
7609 Gotta support the local businesses!
7610 - Clean decor
7611 - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see
7612 - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside.
7613 I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular.
7614 Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!
7615 Very very good lunch spot!
7616 Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu.
7617 But when I tasted the prosciutto "sandwich", I didn't mind anymore.
7618 It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!
7619 My fav Mexican place by far!
7620 They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos I've ever eaten.
7621 Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice.
7622 Love this place!
7623 Bad shop, rude owners.
7624 Pro-tip: If you want to "enhance" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door.
7625 Great food!!!
7626 Everything on the menu is good.
7627 The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.
7628 Pure Fitness as a whole I like.
7629 No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex.
7630 LA Fitness).
7631 Plus you get complimentary training sessions.
7632 However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam.
7633 I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session.
7634 I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all.
7635 I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join.
7636 He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet!
7637 Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.
7638  I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time.
7639 Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate.
7640 My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work!
7641 But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did.
7642 That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.
7643 Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling.
7644 "Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right."
7645 and he went on for about 5 minutes.
7646 I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM???
7647 If they work on commission they should give you a heads up "hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up".
7648 I would have respected that.
7649 OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them.
7650 But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that.
7651 Ps.
7652 Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service.
7653 I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again
7654 Easily the worst "burrito" I have ever had.
7655 It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain.
7656 I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.
7657 Love all their dishes!
7658 To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!
7659 We for las noches de las luminarias.
7660 And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!
7661 Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!
7662 The music was entertaining and a good variety.
7663 They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if you're not shy!
7664 The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.
7665 For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.
7666 Other than that, what a great place to go!
7667 This is really worth taking the time to see and experience.
7668 The cost is very low - $5 per adult.
7669 The garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just people-watch.
7670 Also, the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor.
7671 Metro Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central.
7672 Yum yum yum.
7673 Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away.
7674 We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful.
7675 The fig cake is delicious!!
7676 Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.
7677 The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband.
7678 Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly.
7679 Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow.
7680 We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people.
7681 Enjoy!
7682 I hardly ever get past their carne adovada.
7683 It's simply amazing.
7684 Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it?
7685 Can't be beat!
7686 I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?)
7687 both very, very good.
7688 Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination.
7689 Get there early!
7690 Long waits after 6:00pm!
7691 !
7692 Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.
7693 Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically.
7694 PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.
7695 That's why I ate there instead.
7696 Great customer service, nice owner.
7697 The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona.
7698 Yup.
7699 It's all true.
7700 Great food, super charming place, very intimate.
7701 We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp.
7702 Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.
7703 Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella.
7704 Wine was just ok, but very reasonable.
7705 Server was attentive, helpful and friendly.
7706 Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful.
7707 Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats.
7708 Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.
7709 We'll be back, and with more friends.
7710 Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today.
7711 We had a group of ten.
7712 Service and ambiance were great.
7713 I had the best burger I can remember.
7714 It was Lon's special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.
7715 Highly recommend.
7716 This place is great!
7717 I called at 8:30 am to make an appointment for that afternoon for 3 people.
7718 The place wasn't open yet, but the phone was forwarded to I think the owner's cell.
7719 He told me he would be at the store at 9:30 and he'd call me back when he had the schedule in front of him.
7720 Sure enough, at 9:30 he called me back and was able to schedule our appointments for 3pm.
7721 When we got there we were immediately brought back to a small room that had 3 big, comfy chairs.
7722 We sat down and a couple minutes later they brought in 3 tubs of warm water for our feet.
7723 They reclined the chairs and started at our heads.
7724 They massage your face, head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, feet and calves.
7725 The they tell you to turn over, as they quickly turn the recliner into a massage table and proceed to massage your whole back side....all fully clothed.
7726 It was just wonderful....and all for $30!
7727 I definitely recommend!
7728 i miss this place so much, it's insanity.
7729 ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say.. and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day.
7730 Unlike other reviewers, I didn't like the buffet, though my friends from work think it's a good value.
7731 However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food.
7732 FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried.
7733 Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant.
7734 It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful.
7735 Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.
7736 (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election.
7737 My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too.
7738 After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).
7739 Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).
7740 My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).
7741 Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy.
7742 Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat.
7743 My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that!
7744 Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.
7745 Just had takeout from here.
7746 Amazing as always!!!
7747 Had the carne asada torta.
7748 DDelish!!!
7749 !
7750 The chicken was unreal good!
7751 And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.
7752 It was light and very good!
7753 I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.
7754 Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.
7755 So far I've bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.
7756 The staff are always friendly.
7757 When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter.
7758 Great strore!

7771 Dana, there is no other like Dana!
7772 Even my kids ask to go visit her!
7773 I have 4 children, 2 boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 and 2 girls ages 8 and 19 months.
7774 Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time.
7775 They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave.
7776 She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale, convenient and is very accomodating.
7777 Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!
7778 !
7779 Great little place in a great little neighborhood.
7780 Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard.
7781 Love the place.
7782 Why am I trying to hide my love...
7783 I'm at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week.
7784 Yes, it's totally convenient.
7785 But then again, so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and I'm never there!
7786 I'm trading in my four stars for five stars.
7787 I never get tired of the food (which is totally delish), the drinks, the jolt in the coffee, the servers...and THE HOTEL!
7788 !
7789 You guys always treat me well, and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too.
7790 Thanks for being a great 'light rail convenient' local business!
7791 love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey
7792 We found a bandaid with the panang.
7793 We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid.
7794 When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.
7795 I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!
7796 The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!
7797 !
7798 If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!
7799 Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars.
7800 This place definitely was a ZERO.
7801 I love to come here from time to time when I'm in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service.
7802 The menu is great and there's a variety of dishes for every taste.
7803 The service is great, everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed.
7804 Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends.
7805 I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food, mostly these were meat eaters, I'm assuming, so of course they were not satisfied.
7806 This is a %100 vegan restaurant, note it.
7807 T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.
7808 It's like my home away from home.
7809 I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.
7810 Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!
7811 In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing.
7812 This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul.
7813 Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli.
7814 My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.
7815 Anyone up for a burger?
7816 I just started taking my car here a few months ago.
7817 Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and that's how they got my business.
7818 I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful.
7819 Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I can't say for most mechanics.
7820 The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.
7821 Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs.
7822 I love Lulus cupcakes!
7823 They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles.
7824 This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better.
7825 I love the raven!
7826 The Sales people are nice.
7827  So yummy!
7828 And I love that the place is pink!
7829 I recommend this to everyone.
7830 I have never had a bad meal here.
7831 Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path.
7832 Love this place.
7833 I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!!
7834 I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!!
7835 I highly recommend this work out!!
7836 It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!
7837 !
7838 Oh my gooooooooodness!
7839 I love this store.
7840 I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.
7841 A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.
7842 The experience was amazing.
7843 The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.
7844 Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.
7845 When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.
7846 I hope there will be many more to come.
7847 After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons.
7848 I checkeed thier priced on thier website, but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more, they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning, and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces.
7849 I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum.
7850 They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there.
7851 Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there.
7852 I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.
7853 I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.
7854 Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).
7855 Yet, this store is a foodie's dream.
7856 There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).
7857 Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.
7858 No joke.
7859 It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical).
7860 I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.
7861 Did I want a made-to-order wrap?
7862 Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas?
7863 (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?
7864 Pizza?
7865 Salad bar?
7866 Soup?
7867 Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh!
7868 A cupcake from the cupcake bar?
7869 On and on it went.
7870 My final decision was sushi.
7871 The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp.
7872 I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.
7873 Bliss.
7874 I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser.
7875 All in all, a very satisfying meal.
7876 Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store.
7877 Then again, it is Whole Foods.
7878 A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g.
7879 a shopping list).
7880 If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.
7881 Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.
7882 Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.
7883 Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect "date night" too.
7884 The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here.
7885 I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout.
7886 I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry.
7887 I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things.
7888 Delicious!
7889 This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene.
7890 Two of my friends had food -poisoning after having dinner here.
7891 The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here.
7892 The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11.
7893 One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!).
7894 I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.
7895 I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food.
7896 If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day.
7897 Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.
7898 Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!
7899 Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.
7900 This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.
7901 The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.
7902 When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.
7903 IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.
7904 There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.
7905 The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.
7906 The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.
7907 The amount of cheese is just right.
7908 I love to savor each and every bite.
7909 There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.
7910 This one has other items in addition to the pizza.
7911 We like their antipasto.
7912 It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.
7913 Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!
7914 Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks.
7915 Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and "owner" would not honor their warranty.
7916 They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!
7917 Championship establishment here.
7918 I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night.
7919 At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.
7920 They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6.
7921 Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings.
7922 Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger.
7923 Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings.
7924 We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno.
7925 Both were extremely awesome.
7926 You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings).
7927 The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better.
7928 I don't agree, and I don't disagree.
7929 Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu.
7930 The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.
7931 The service was really awesome.
7932 They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay.
7933 I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well.
7934 Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it.
7935 Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant.
7936 To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).
7937 Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome.
7938 It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again.
7939 Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter?
7940 It's just as good if not better than BJ's.
7941 I am actually excited to go here again.
7942 With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of.
7943 The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill.
7944 Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway.
7945 Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment.
7946 This place is amazing!
7947 The food was delicious, the waffle was like no other.
7948 The service was great, very attentive and nice.
7949 I will be returning.
7950 We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town.
7951 So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.
7952 Love their steak with buttered plates.
7953 We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction.
7954 But after being there so many times I know how to order it.
7955 Sweet potato casserole is excellent.
7956 Cesar salad is the best I've ever had.
7957 On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees.
7958 I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice.
7959 The atmosphere is good.
7960 It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.
7961 Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter.
7962 Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still.
7963 Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!
7964 I've been to Mortons twice.
7965 Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris.
7966 Postinos on the East side!
7967 ?
7968 Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeah
7969 It's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough
7970 You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos
7971 Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.
7972 Very attractive crowd!
7973 I am honor just to be here!
7974 Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind
7975 I can't be saved
7976 4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave
7977 If there's some left for you
7978 and don't mind if I do
7979 I might as well face it I'm addicted to Postinos
7980 I've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.
7981 The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.
7982 Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!
7983 The ambience is always chill and low lighting.
7984 Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!
7985 Service is always great at Postinos.
7986 The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular!
7987 - Enjoy!
7988 Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons:
7989 #1 Perfect fish and chips.
7990 #2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.
7991 They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.
7992 Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand).
7993 The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.
7994 The world's most competitive trivia night.
7995 These people STUDY for trivia night.
7996 Great outdoor seating, good service.
7997 Decor is interesting, especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90% of the wall art.
7998 One of my favorite places to come.
7999 Their salsa and guacamole is to die for.
8000 I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.
8001 I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla.
8002 Delicious!!
8003 !
8004 I eat the entire plate every time.
8005 Great place, enjoyed the amenities.
8006 Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque.
8007 Food in the property restaurants were very good.
8008 Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again.
8009 What would I do without this place?
8010 They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.
8011 Very clean.
8012 Fresh produce, fresh seafood, fresh meat.
8013 I love how they have pre sliced meats.
8014 This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.
8015 Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though.
8016 They're not very good.
8017 love.
8018 Love.
8019 LOVE.
8020 How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me.
8021 It's like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano.
8022 And that's exactly what a music store should be.
8023 It should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesn't exist.
8024 First and foremost, the staff is extremely friendly, both on the phone and in person.
8025 I've spent I don't know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and they've always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads.
8026 It's just an awesome amazing experience.
8027 They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end.
8028 I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument, and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.
8029 Go to Milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be.
8030 What else can I say that hasn't been said already?
8031 I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!
8032 My baby loved the mango lassi flavor!
8033 So much he did the sign for "more " for the first time at the store:)
8034 I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order
8035 LOVE THIS PLACE!
8036 We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.
8037 My husband eats here during the week too!
8038 Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!
8039 The veggie soup is delicious.
8040 The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.
8041 For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!
8042 Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!
8043 Service is terrific!
8044 FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.
8045 Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!
8046 Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joe's for sure
8047 I found this place via Google while in town for business.
8048 It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.
8049 I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good.
8050 For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original "g" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!
8051 Service was friendly and efficient.
8052 _______________
8053 Update:
8054 12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix?
8055 Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green!
8056 This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce.
8057 I couldn't get enough!
8058 Very delicious
8059 12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice.
8060 The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it.
8061 Oh well, can't win them all.
8062 12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch.
8063 I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw.
8064 It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless.
8065 The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.
8066 12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!
8067 No need for a long review.
8068 Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.
8069 Great Food
8070 Great Customer Service
8071 Love this place
8072 I love Petco!
8073 The only place I go to get dog food.
8074 I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!
8075 Wow, is this some fantastic food!
8076 It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased.
8077 Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal.
8078 Presentation and taste were top notch.
8079 The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had.
8080 I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.
8081 Visit Date: 11/18/09
8082 LOVE this place.
8083 Great food, high quality ingredients (which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut), and fun service.
8084 I love this place, and always leave happy and full.
8085 Authentic italian food is my weak spot!
8086 :)
8087 Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.
8088 Was a HORRIBLE experience.
8089 My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.
8090 She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.
8091 She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.
8092 She said I wouldn't look good.
8093 At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.
8094 At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.
8095 (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!
8096 !
8097 Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one.
8098 I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again.
8099 Food was WAY overpriced and just OK.
8100 Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality.
8101 I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.
8102 We loved this place.
8103 One of favorite happy hour places in town.
8104 If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else.
8105 Great location and nothing else needs to be said.
8106 Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
8107 Love the wings!
8108 Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.
8109 Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice.
8110 They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special.
8111 I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish.
8112 The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste.
8113 By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.
8114 As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor.
8115 This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away.
8116 Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick.
8117 At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.
8118 Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.
8119 Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.
8120 The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush.
8121 I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.
8122 This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.
8123 Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!
8124 Simply awesome!
8125 Great beer and great staff!
8126 Will try the food next time!
8127 Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy!
8128 Ha!
8129 G
8130 The food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon.
8131 Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave.
8132 The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting, of finest quality!
8133 Really enjoyed and will spread the word!
8134 Best breakfast in west Chandler!
8135 I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.
8136 While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did.
8137 The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers.
8138 We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations.
8139 Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
8140 I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona.
8141 My office at the time was within walking distance.
8142 This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU.
8143 Plenty of stores all around.
8144 I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers.
8145 It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends.
8146 The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow.
8147 After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend, hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree.
8148 We arrived a little tired and stressed; we left tan, relaxed, and rejuvenated.
8149 The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked.
8150 Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet.
8151 We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa.
8152 We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.
8153 We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool.
8154 We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional.
8155 If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the "Madonna Special" for you.
8156 A very refreshing smoothie.
8157 During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos.
8158 Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club.
8159 It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course.
8160 Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable.
8161 I hope we return someday!
8162 They have the BEST Pad Thai!
8163 I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night.
8164 (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.
8165 Of course, I had to try their pad thai.
8166 Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.
8167 You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai.
8168 If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!
8169 Now that's what I call delicious!
8170 Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here.
8171 Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger.
8172 Truffle fries are also delicious.
8173 Always have good service here and leave very satisfied.
8174 Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain.
8175 You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here.
8176 This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was!
8177 Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!
8178 ), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things.
8179 I love that this is close to my house!
8180 The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club.
8181 Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit?
8182 I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.
8183 And so it is.
8184 We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty.
8185 There is no hostess or even a hint of one.
8186 We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people?
8187 The place was dead.).
8188 We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio.
8189 Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD.
8190 I guess we'll wait.
8191 We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand.
8192 The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes.
8193 That's sure inviting, isn't it.
8194 So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections.
8195 $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich.
8196 That sounds innocuous enough, right?
8197 The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered.
8198 Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place.
8199 My "veggie" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying.
8200 I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was.
8201 Eggplant.
8202 Ohhhhkay then.
8203 It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows.
8204 Impossible.
8205 The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding.
8206 Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth.
8207 My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger.
8208 There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous.
8209 Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches.
8210 I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.
8211 So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA.
8212 You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check.
8213 Nope.
8214 No.
8215 Nada.
8216 Had to chase someone down and ask for it.
8217 When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out.
8218 I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care.
8219 I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.
8220 Just UGH in every way.
8221 Had the mahi and it was great.
8222 Very reasonably priced also.
8223 Definitely a repeat.
8224 I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.
8225 I even gave the same statement to the owner.
8226 I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.
8227 He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.
8228 Well, it was FANTASTIC!
8229 Of course, I called him back to let him know.
8230 The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.
8231 This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.
8232 There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.
8233 I can't wait to go back and try some more!
8234 This place is just so so rad.
8235 It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.
8236 The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all.
8237 No kidding.
8238 I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here.
8239 All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again.
8240 Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there.
8241 And you will see various other people wearing the same ones.
8242 If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place.
8243 AND to make it even better...they sell for retail!
8244 So markups?
8245 Not an issue.
8246 Do yourself a favor and check this place out...
8247 Dr. Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing.
8248 I am a Physician Assistant in surgery, and  appreciated his "bedside" manner as well as medical knowledge, which was phenomenal.
8249 He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had.
8250 Not to mention, he was fantastic with my scared min pin.
8251 I cannot recommend him enough.
8252 The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful!
8253 Nice selection of stuff, but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut, THEN wait in line forever to pay.
8254 For such a giant store, it appears there are 3 employees.
8255 That's it.
8256 I miss Hancock Fabrics, THEY knew how to treat customers.
8257 Just open.
8258 I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.
8259 Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.
8260 I highly reccommend this place.
8261 P.S.
8262 :  iPad driven POS system is way cool.
8263 I don't frequent Tempe too often, but when I do, I try to get a Tea Infusion run in... everytime I succeed, I literally have a grin on my face after every sip.
8264 It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book.
8265 Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?
8266 Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai.
8267 Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said "SURE!"
8268 It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before.
8269 So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say?
8270 "SURE!
8271 But be careful it's hot."
8272 And oh so YUM!
8273 I think they deserve the taglines "Have it your way" and "Any way you want it" more than Burger King!
8274 Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said "No" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.
8275 Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can...
8276 I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.
8277 But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one...
8278 I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty.
8279 I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.
8280 My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.
8281 I'll tea back REAL SOON!
8282 We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant .
8283 The food is excellent and the service is very good .
8284 If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go!
8285 As close to a real, east coast deli as you'll find west of the Appalachians.
8286 Delicious sandwiches, egg creams, etc.
8287 Pricy, but kids apparently eat free in summer, so we kept it at 5 stars.
8288 We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche.
8289 This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location... but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside.
8290 What a great little place with very friendly staff!
8291 We really appreciated the cleanliness too.
8292 We ordered the shrimp ceviche, shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce.
8293 Everything was outstanding!
8294 Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious!
8295 And the tortillas,  uh-mazin!!
8296 Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service.
8297 We will definitely come back and bring friends next time!
8298 Between the two of us, we already texted half our friends about this place and we haven't even finished eating yet!
8299 RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!
8300 !
8301 !!!!!!!
8302 ***  O M G ......So GOOD  ***   !!!!!!
8303 !
8304 My family & I keep coming back to this place.
8305 We drive over 10 miles to get our fix.
8306 I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked, and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food!
8307 Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy.
8308 I might not brush my teeth tonight!
8309 Here's what we had:
8310 ~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry), cheese, onions, potatoes, and Jalapenos.
8311 Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice, and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos.
8312 ~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al  pastor, cheese, onions, jalapenos, mayo, avocado,
8313 ~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese.
8314 I love the owners.
8315 Very friendly and accomodating.
8316 One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.
8317 Turns out they were hosting a private party.
8318 They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.
8319 I adore their Greek fries.
8320 Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.
8321 Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.
8322 Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.
8323 Awesome resort.
8324 I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.
8325 I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.
8326 The summer is off season for this spot.
8327 We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.
8328 Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.
8329 It feels so luxurious.
8330 Goddess got it right.
8331 This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.
8332 Big disappointment.
8333 There was nothing for vegetarians.
8334 The food was mediocre at best.
8335 I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.
8336 Don't judge a book by its cover.
8337 No good.
8338 This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.
8339 Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.
8340 We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.
8341 Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests.
8342 In times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley.
8343 It is just a great place to hang out, set-up your laptop or read a book.
8344 I thoroughly enjoyed my Joltachinno, a much better version of the Starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet.
8345 We came back another day for lunch and all I can say is yum!
8346 I have never had food like this at a coffeehouse.
8347 Amazingly, for our second time there, they recongnized us!
8348 WOW!
8349 I am glad that I have found my new hangout when I come to the valley!
8350 Great food and service.
8351 Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect.
8352 best coffee in phoenix (so far).
8353 experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood.
8354 i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk.
8355 it was properly steamed microfoam.
8356 the shots were right on, too.
8357 the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare.
8358 thumbs up to fair trade.
8359 this place rules, plain and simple
8360 just wish they had a cheaper jukebox
8361 If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.
8362 I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.
8363 At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.
8364 Estrella called a couple more times to "verify my address".
8365 At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.
8366 As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab.
8367 He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost.
8368 This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!
8369 Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?
8370 End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for.
8371 I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.
8372 So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.
8373 WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.
8374 There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust.
8375 A good mechanic is high on that list.
8376 I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter.
8377 Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too.
8378 His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair.
8379 The most important aspect of his tweets?
8380 They're immediate.
8381 At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service.
8382 However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out.
8383 Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does.
8384 Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right.
8385 He had made me a lifelong customer at that point.
8386 When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott.
8387 With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for.
8388 Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative.
8389 And he didn't charge him for the assessment.
8390 Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash.
8391 My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate.
8392 I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's.
8393 Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership.
8394 The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable.
8395 Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!
8396 I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch, even though it is practically in my own backyard, but with my friend's endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad, I relented.
8397 And I'm glad I did!
8398 It's now become a staple for lunch meetings!
8399 The dining area is bright and cheerful, but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!
8400 It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.
8401 The menu is rather short on items, but long on freshness and flavor.
8402 Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.
8403 I have found my favorites on the menu, in particular, the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus, tomatoes, roasted red bell pepper, grilled red onions, pepitas, smoked gouda, and romaine.
8404 (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)
8405 Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips.
8406 The portions are hearty.
8407 The service is attentive, but not intrusive.
8408 An absolutely divine dine!
8409 Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After
8410 Cited as "the best pizza in America" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience.
8411 But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food.
8412 This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers.
8413 However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez.
8414 My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix.
8415 After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009.
8416 I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception.
8417 I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line.
8418 Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble.
8419 However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us.
8420 Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time.
8421 When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added.
8422 We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma.
8423 All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced.
8424 We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another "slice of heaven".
8425 And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me.
8426 I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for.
8427 April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all.
8428 My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open.
8429 We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, "Well, the wait hasn't changed".
8430 Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time.
8431 We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight.
8432 Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions.
8433 When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak.
8434 All I could muster up was, "Are you cooking tonight?"
8435 To which he replied, "No, I have Horatio at the oven.
8436 I can't cook anymore."
8437 I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same.
8438 We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar.
8439 At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar.
8440 We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara.
8441 The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris.
8442 As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer.
8443 The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time.
8444 From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed!
8445 So what makes for the "best pizza in America" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line?
8446 Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves.
8447 To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!
8448 OK ok ok.
8449 I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.
8450 That being said, I love it!
8451 The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.
8452 The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.
8453 The food - that's probably the only tougher part.
8454 Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.
8455 The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.
8456 I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.
8457 They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.
8458 I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.
8459 There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon.
8460 Being my first review, there is only one place I've always had a 5-star experience.
8461 Hoodlum's is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley.
8462 ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience.
8463 Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners I've ever met.
8464 They know a ton about music and the local scene.
8465 They'll help you find anything you need.
8466 Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joe's), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD you've been waiting to purchase.
8467 They also have a wide selection of used CD's and DVD's to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!
8468 Great groceries and fantastic service, keep it up.
8469 If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you.
8470 I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year.
8471 I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well.
8472 In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor.
8473 I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well.
8474 Ironic, isn't it?
8475 You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking.
8476 For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you.
8477 We don't live forever, but we can live better while we are here.
8478 Take control of your medical care, it's your body and therefore your decision.
8479 Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health.
8480 When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries.
8481 Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out.
8482 Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house.
8483 :)
8484 The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience.
8485 The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable.
8486 So anyway, on to the sushi!
8487 I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura.
8488 The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous.
8489 They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce.
8490 LOVE!
8491 And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura.
8492 Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer.
8493 The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious.
8494 Their prices are great and you still get so much food.
8495 How can you go wrong?
8496 If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.
8497 Also, I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses!
8498 They depend on your patronage!
8499 Went with three others.
8500 My first & last visit.
8501 The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish.
8502 It was dreadful.
8503 The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.
8504 The restaurant was extremely noisy.
8505 Not pleasant at all & terrible food.
8506 Will never go back.
8507 A big disappointment.
8508 They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with.
8509 They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish.
8510 The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers.
8511 Are they stupid?
8512 I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.
8513 It's a third world country.
8514 They can barely afford to feed themselves.
8515 They have no history of cuisine.
8516 I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again.
8517 Loves the recent Cezanne show.
8518 In fact I've seen it twice in the last week.
8519 I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine.
8520 The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing.
8521 The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday.
8522 I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp.
8523 I think it is great to have music in the galleries.
8524 I liked the musicians being on a platform.
8525 since the room isn't banked one can see the performers.
8526 A few things I'm not so crazy about:
8527 The great room is this awesome space for large art.
8528 Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours.
8529 You know, not such great art.
8530 I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting.
8531 The cafe never quite lives up to its promise.
8532 My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box.
8533 Enough grousing I love the place and go often.
8534 Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever!
8535 Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music.
8536 Food was so so but over priced for what it was.
8537 I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.
8538 I used to say, "You know what would be the best theater?
8539 AMC experience, with Harkins seats.."
8540 Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.
8541 I love this place.
8542 It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.
8543 Not to mention an IMAX.
8544 The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.
8545 Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.
8546 I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.
8547 Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.
8548 Not bad for all the free stuff you get.
8549 Another cool thing about this theater is the location.
8550 If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.
8551 Nice work AMC on making a great theater!
8552 !
8553 Ohhh big big big heads up.
8554 Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.
8555 that's probably the draw back.
8556 I'll still give you 5 stars.
8557 I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!
8558 It has taken me over a week to get to the review.
8559 I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.
8560 How do you say, "Damn that was good!"
8561 in German?
8562 I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).
8563 The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.
8564 Service was very good throughout the meal.
8565 There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.
8566 It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!
8567 Avoid this einstein's at all cost.
8568 I have been laying in bed puking for over 12 hours because I ate at this garbage dump.
8569 The reason I know it was them?
8570 My girl is laying next to me puking as well.
8571 And the only place we both ate together less than 24 hours ago was there.
8572 The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches.
8573 After we got home and ate them, fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.
8574 The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them.
8575 Then they touch my food and I get sick.
8576 Based on the staff that day, it does not surprise me one bit.
8577 I would recommend starving over going here.
8578 Never again.
8579 Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more.
8580 I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.
8581 I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.
8582 I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the "S" coffee store.
8583 One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.
8584 The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine.
8585 Very good place to eat..
8586 I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people, they always interact with their customers.
8587 I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want.
8588 I highly recommend this place.
8589 Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY!
8590 !
8591 Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did.
8592 It was absolutely delicious.
8593 Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didn't have to wait at all for a table (YES!).
8594 I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased.
8595 However, my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous.
8596 It was awesome and my favorite by far.
8597 Dr. Ford is great.
8598 She came highly recommended and I can see why.
8599 Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.
8600 Bring your animals here, they will be taken care of properly.
8601 Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store.
8602 Oh yeah?
8603 Stuff it.
8604 Like donuts?
8605 Check this out.
8606 Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts.
8607 Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts.
8608 My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out.
8609 It's so worth it.
8610 They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust.
8611 My co-workers and I refer to this place as "Pizza n' Ants".
8612 The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.
8613 Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem.
8614 As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.
8615 If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!
8616 My daughter and I really love it here.
8617 I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.
8618 The staff is very friendly, talented and professional.
8619 Highly recommended!
8620 I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good.
8621 Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing.
8622 The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot).
8623 For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty.
8624 For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly.
8625 Try it.
8626 Detail:
8627 Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food.
8628 I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh.
8629 I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales.
8630 It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.
8631 I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something.
8632 So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away.
8633 Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had.
8634 The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.
8635 It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full.
8636 I've never waited to be seated though.
8637 I've never tried the bar area.
8638 The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that.
8639 They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed.
8640 The chips and salsa are endless and excellent.
8641 Service is always good.
8642 Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever.
8643 I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.
8644 This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain.
8645 No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty.
8646 It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment.
8647 I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat.
8648 This place is definitely not a good look
8649 Wow, Chill rocks.
8650 Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic.
8651 The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome.
8652 While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground.
8653 Frank replaced it for free.
8654 Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix.
8655 Yum.
8656 How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert.
8657 That sounds like the perfect evening.
8658 Ok, technically this is not Mexican food, it's spanish and puerto rican food, but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY, WAY, WAY good.
8659 first off, they have plaintains, which look like bananas, but taste like potatoes.
8660 if you've never had them, try them here, yum!
8661 this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes.
8662 good luck, because the menu is HUGE.
8663 the dessert menu alone has two dozen items!
8664 seafood like ceviche and paella (supposed to be to die for), tapas, tamales, soup, salads, egg dishes (not breakfast),...the list goes on and on and that's just lunch!
8665 plates top off around $12 for the most expensive for lunch, but you can easily make a meal out of two apps.
8666 the mojito is their specialty, and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from, along with sangria.
8667 on the last monday of the month, every bottle of spanish wine is half off- you cork it if you don't finish it.
8668 i can't give this rest.
8669 a more glowing recommendation!
8670 Durants ROCKS.
8671 I love the red velvet walls.
8672 I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant.
8673 I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it.
8674 I love the steaks.
8675 I love the decor.
8676 I love the bar.
8677 We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night, and all raved about what we had.
8678 I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what you order.
8679 It's amazing, delicious, and very very unique.
8680 I had the misfortune of stopping by this establishment today with two things, a skirt and a cloth handbag.
8681 I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse.
8682 She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said 'Oh no I don't see how this could be repaired'.
8683 (what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter).
8684 Not a difficult task.
8685 She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back.
8686 WHAT??
8687 !
8688 I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it).
8689 She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process.
8690 So I went to another dry cleaners and asked the same things for both the skirt and the bag.
8691 I was informed that what I wanted done would be no problem and that I could pick it up the next day.
8692 I love this place.
8693 The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy.
8694 Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time.
8695 Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome.
8696 If you've got a party bigger than 4 though, call ahead.
8697 Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland.
8698 Insanely good selection & product.
8699 Tanzanian peaberry off the charts.
8700 Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.
8701 One of my most favorite coffee shops!
8702 Location for sure.
8703 Soooo cute here.
8704 Inside and out.
8705 The patio is beautiful and you feel like you're in a diff city for a moment.
8706 Coffee is pretty darn good.
8707 Not the best, but good.
8708 And the menu is great.
8709 I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us.
8710 The treats are amazing.
8711 The staff is amazing.
8712 And they always seem to play great music too.
8713 Love this place.
8714 Wish it were not so far away in Mesa...
8715 I love this restaurant.
8716 Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good.
8717 My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week.
8718 The staff is very friendly and attentive.
8719 The environment is very comforting.
8720 I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.
8721 I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves.
8722 This Office Max is a great in and out shop.
8723 On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center.
8724 It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50.
8725 In fact, they are helpful!
8726 They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed.
8727 The copy center staff was also very friendly.
8728 This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable!
8729 I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here.
8730 So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings.
8731 Tasty Thai- is.
8732 But it could also be called Delicious Thai.
8733 And the service is always great!
8734 If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!
8735 As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!)
8736 fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!
8737 Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).
8738 They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.
8739 It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all!
8740 The horchata here is also 5-star material.
8741 Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it!
8742 Its giant, it will make you happy.
8743 And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving!
8744 I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!
8745 I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.
8746 But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice!
8747 I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.
8748 This place needs to stick around for awhile!
8749 Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!
8750 Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!
8751 I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!
8752 Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.
8753 And the burger too!
8754 You really cant go wrong here.
8755 Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).
8756 One desert is enough for 2-3 people!
8757 Amazing cheesesteak.
8758 One mile from my home is Corleone's.
8759 About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's.
8760 I never go to Corleone's.
8761 I go to Capriotti's all the time.
8762 The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific.
8763 The large is 20" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium.
8764 Also, try it with the hot peppers.
8765 It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.
8766 That's really all I can say about this place.
8767 Wonderful cheesesteak.
8768 I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there.
8769 The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else.
8770 There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside?
8771 so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.
8772 Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's.
8773 Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves.
8774 The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal.
8775 I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive.
8776 I have been exploring more of the park recently.
8777 I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.
8778 The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.
8779 Highly recommended.
8780 I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.
8781 They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.
8782 Going back for more...
8783 Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me.
8784 I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center.
8785 I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.
8786 I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.
8787 I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.
8788 I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.
8789 After completing the network-wiring job, I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great
8790 Been here twice.
8791 First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup.
8792 All the techs have been extremely honest and I've never felt taken advantage of.
8793 I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I could've spent more but again, they're honest and didn't pressure me to do everything that they said.
8794 It's family owned & run (they're originally from the bay area so of course I've got a soft spot!)
8795 If you have car problems, need a check up, or need a second opinion, they won't steer you wrong (pun intended).
8796 This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists.
8797 The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book.
8798 It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile.
8799 The owner is seriously the nicest lady I've seen running a business in a long time.
8800 Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place!
8801 5/5
8802 I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo!
8803 If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi.
8804 We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)!
8805 Their rolls are amazing too.
8806 All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion!
8807 Very fresh!
8808 The service is great too.
8809 I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place.
8810 Five stars, too!
8811 After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight.
8812 WOW!
8813 It was a GREAT experience!!
8814 !
8815 We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!
8816 Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.
8817 Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!!
8818 Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!
8819 The entire meal was SUPERB!
8820 The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!
8821 I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship.
8822 Everyone is polished, polite and efficient!
8823 The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!
8824 Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)...
8825 I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean...
8826 REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!
8827 Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.
8828 I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner.
8829 Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self.
8830 We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.
8831 I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare.
8832 I love Tasty Kabob!
8833 Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.
8834 I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.
8835 The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.
8836 Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good.
8837 Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.
8838 It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.
8839 Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.
8840 Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.
8841 The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.
8842 Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?
8843 Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best.
8844 Dim lighting.
8845 Fleet Foxes.
8846 Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret.
8847 Band of Horses.
8848 Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be.
8849 The Shins.
8850 Black board specials, just because they look cool.
8851 Beirut.
8852 $13 vegetable dishes.
8853 Intimidated yet?
8854 Fight through the angst.
8855 Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.
8856 Order the forbidden rice bowl.
8857 Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic.
8858 If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic.
8859 That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust.
8860 Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven.
8861 If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon "superfood" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?
8862 But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had.
8863 It was just so damn... moist.
8864 There, I said it.
8865 Moist.
8866 Moist.
8867 Moist.
8868 Ew.
8869 But really, yum.
8870 If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful.
8871 Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake.
8872 Layered.
8873 In a jar.
8874 Who thought of that?
8875 Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who.
8876 And let's be honest, you've earned dessert.
8877 I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right?
8878 Right.
8879 Of course you did.
8880 Yes, it is a biker bar.
8881 And it is packed with them at certain times, especially weekends.
8882 I don't ride.
8883 But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any, and if everyone seems to know everyone it's because they are all friendly local folks.
8884 So if you're visiting Cave Creek don't assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the "bikers" probably drive BMWs during the week.
8885 I stop in at least once a week for a bite.
8886 The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome.
8887 I've been to every bar in town.
8888 Harold's , The Chip, Toad, etc.
8889 all are good, but The Hideaway is the best.
8890 Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago...
8891 Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.
8892 Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!
8893 Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!
8894 Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me.
8895 Just because this place is called "Maria Maria" doesn't mean they sell Mexican food.
8896 Their menu actually says "Mexican inspired cuisine" which should have been my clue to leave.
8897 The food is border line Nasty!
8898 The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but it's so loud in there that it ruins the "romantic" mood.
8899 I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music.
8900 Why would they do that in a "Mexican" restaurant?
8901 I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal.
8902 I don't recommend this place for any meal!
8903 I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is "Cougar" town.
8904 The bar was full of them.
8905 I'm beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go.
8906 I'm embarrassed for them.
8907 They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves?
8908 gee.
8909 I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon.
8910 I ordered a salad to go.
8911 As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't.
8912 I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow.
8913 Very disappointed.
8914 $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers.
8915 I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website.
8916 I won't be returning here.
8917 I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.
8918 R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot!
8919 The service and the atmosphere were outstanding.
8920 We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus.
8921 The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized.
8922 The food was wonderful.
8923 We will be going back!
8924 I have been going to Nails 101 for a long time, and I love them!
8925 I had a manicure done there about a month ago, and it lasted for 8 days without chipping!
8926 Love Nails 101!!!!!!!
8927 !
8928 I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!
8929 Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).
8930 Very tasty.
8931 The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable.
8932 The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price.
8933 The cheese is amazing!
8934 I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on).
8935 I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food.
8936 I highly recommend El Bravo.
8937 EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!
8938 Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on.
8939 We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken .
8940 .
8941 .
8942 and one quick blink of the eye and the "peacemakers" were before us!
8943 Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!
8944 Bravo Thirsty Lion!
8945 What.
8946 The.
8947 Heck.
8948 ??
8949 Be prepared for sticker shock!
8950 I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.
8951 And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!
8952 Whew!
8953 This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes...
8954 Baiz market reminds me of Chicago.
8955 There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many.
8956 If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs.
8957 And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book!
8958 This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too!
8959 =)
8960 I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix.
8961 I was blown away by the services.
8962 This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years.
8963 I received a room on the 15 floor.
8964 Room was what you expect from Sheraton.
8965 The view from the room really sucked!!
8966 I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers.
8967 TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee.
8968 Room also came with a refrigerator.
8969 I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines.
8970 After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar.
8971 The desserts are yummy.
8972 I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel.
8973 Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street.
8974 My work colleague used the gym.
8975 He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need.
8976 Next time!!!
8977 I would definitely stay here again!
8978 !
8979 This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership.
8980 Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu.
8981 Anyway, I absolutely love coming here.
8982 My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine.
8983 It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face.
8984 I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel.
8985 The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique.
8986 If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba.
8987 You won't be disappointed!
8988 I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.
8989 That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.
8990 (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)
8991 The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.
8992 The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).
8993 We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!
8994 ), and a few other pieces.
8995 Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.
8996 We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).
8997 The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.
8998 We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.
8999 This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.
9000 Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.
9001 I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:
9002 1.
9003 Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.
9004 Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.
9005 2.
9006 Ask the chef what he/she recommends.
9007 Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.
9008 And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.
9009 Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago...
9010 I might go broke.
9011 Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!
9012 Rental car review.
9013 118 degrees.
9014 Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.
9015 10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.
9016 Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.
9017 Finally, a bus!
9018 We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.
9019 5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.
9020 PHX...pay attention.
9021 Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.
9022 Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way.
9023 The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel.
9024 They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out.
9025 The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers.
9026 Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place.
9027 Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.
9028 What a cool hotel!
9029 I've never stayed anywhere like this.
9030 I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.
9031 (And yes, it's been renovated.
9032 This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)
9033 The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.
9034 Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.
9035 What's not to like?
9036 This place is so great!
9037 I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for.
9038 The woman did this for no charge!
9039 It was only the second time I went there.
9040 She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge.
9041 She was super sweet!
9042 Waste of time.
9043 I could not even get in there today because there was a football game.
9044 The wanted me to pay $10 just to park.
9045 How stupid is that!
9046 2 days before Christmas.
9047 I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall.
9048 Goobye and good riddens.
9049 I have better things to do with my time and money.
9050 How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?
9051 I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free.
9052 My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.
9053 I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.
9054 The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.
9055 I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.
9056 The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.
9057 Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.
9058 They could double their prices and I would still come back!
9059 I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.
9060 Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like!
9061 Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city.
9062 Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.
9063 Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive.
9064 If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall.
9065 Love, love, LOVE this place!
9066 Eugenia is a genius!
9067 Macarons = amazing.
9068 Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.
9069 Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.
9070 My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was.
9071 F724
9072 She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence.
9073 Just handed me a ticket and was done with me.
9074 If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business.
9075 Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell.
9076 With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me).
9077 So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early.
9078 Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map.
9079 How precious.
9080 I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously?
9081 Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?)
9082 After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life.
9083 To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public:
9084 1) Bathe.
9085 The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing.
9086 Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html
9087 2) Sit still.
9088 Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour.
9089 But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster.
9090 Trust me, I was watching the clock.
9091 If you feel anxious, get up and walk around.
9092 3) Leash your children.
9093 If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car.
9094 It's winter, they'll be fine.
9095 It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers.
9096 It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me.
9097 4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls.
9098 To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping.
9099 The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl.
9100 Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker.
9101 5) Acknowledge the humans around you.
9102 Yeah, I get it.
9103 I'm not that big.
9104 In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear.
9105 But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg.
9106 Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level.
9107 Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity.
9108 And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear.
9109 There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it.
9110 Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering.
9111 I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper.
9112 Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).
9113 Le sigh...
9114 Open T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm
9115 They are the best!
9116 99% of my pain in my back is gone, thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.
9117 Bonnie Wills
9118 Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.
9119 New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.
9120 Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.
9121 Re-did tables and got new cues.
9122 Its rockin now.
9123 It's called America's friendliest airport for a reason- it truly embodies world class service to all.
9124 I love it here it's clean, great places to eat and smiling faces to great you esp at TSA!
9125 What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!
9126 Open 7 days a week with lobby service
9127 I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees.
9128 I opened both a savings and checking account here.
9129 Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.
9130 I'm thinking - here we go again.
9131 But it was one of those think on your feet moments.
9132 Off they went (I'll assume to get approval).
9133 They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.
9134 In fact, if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM, they will refund you the service fees.
9135 How refreshing with the current state of banking.
9136 short leash is awesome!
9137 we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar.
9138 we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free.
9139 everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack.
9140 I can't wait until they come back!
9141 So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip.
9142 Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon.
9143 Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money.
9144 Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice.
9145 I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1") so I went to this salon...
9146 I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved.
9147 .Again though, the coupon lured me in.
9148 Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever.
9149 Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her.
9150 Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair!
9151 I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.
9152 The style sucked too.
9153 I just left.
9154 I did not have time to see if they could fix it again.
9155 I will not be going back to this place for any services.
9156 Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness.
9157 UGH!
9158 I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products.
9159 Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.
9160 She was totally spot-on.
9161 These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!
9162 I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.
9163 I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.
9164 I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.
9165 I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!
9166 I've passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there (even though they are always busy!)
9167 As I stared at my feet, long overdue for a pedicure, I thought it was about time to try them...since walmart rarely let's me down why should the nail salon inside?
9168 To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or $23 not too bad this day in age...my to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street!
9169 I'm glad to be the first to review them they deserve it!
9170 Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair I'd be set!
9171 First hole in one on #3.
9172 I'll always love you Vistal.
9173 I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same.
9174 I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality.
9175 Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk.
9176 I have had  great serive at this location.
9177 Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location, i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location.
9178 I wanted to give the asu location one star.
9179 My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude.
9180 She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done.
9181 If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes.
9182 If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too, NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service.
9183 Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet.
9184 The place was just your typical stable, but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here.
9185 It was our first time riding, so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses.
9186 We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners).
9187 The horses were very tame, and were easy to ride.
9188 The best part of the experience, however, was our interaction with the staff.
9189 They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful.
9190 We're excited to go back.
9191 As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!
9192 I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.
9193 Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.
9194 It is super yummy.
9195 They also have a rice-based soup.
9196 And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.
9197 Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.
9198 Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.
9199 I'd recommend everyone try it again.
9200 One of the WORST experiences of my life.
9201 My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.
9202 So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.
9203 We go in and we thought, "hey wow, this is kinda cool" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.
9204 However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had "cottage cheese" legs and thighs.
9205 We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.
9206 He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us "you either pay or i come over the counter" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.
9207 We will never ever go there again.
9208 Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.
9209 ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.
9210 Anyways, don't go here.
9211 Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.
9212 the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.
9213 The fries although fried in lard, are crap.
9214 All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.
9215 If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.
9216 I totally agree with L.C.
9217 's review.
9218 Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.
9219 Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.
9220 I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.
9221 My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.
9222 It's fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.
9223 I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.
9224 I don't know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley, but if I had kids, they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!
9225 I've been going here for 10 years.
9226 My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe.
9227 I needed everything quickly and was very specific.
9228 She got everything done in time for my trip.
9229 Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes.
9230 She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress.
9231 She's hemmed and taken in.
9232 She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look.
9233 I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it.
9234 We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks.
9235 Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality.
9236 Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.
9237 I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.
9238 But you can't.
9239 But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.
9240 For starters, their automatic doors do not even work.
9241 I just find that appalling.
9242 How can your doors not work on your store?
9243 How are people supposed to get in there to shop.
9244 The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.
9245 I asked for help and all I received was attitude.
9246 For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy, I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.
9247 But, not here.
9248 I don't think it will be long before this location closes.
9249 RIP!
9250 YUUKK!!
9251 !
9252 That pretty much describes this place.
9253 We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.
9254 Only 1 person in line in front of us.
9255 I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.
9256 ...it took about 40 mins to get my food.
9257 But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.
9258 But by God it wasn't good at all.
9259 The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.
9260 The potato salad was very flavorless as well.
9261 The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.
9262 Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.
9263 The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.
9264 So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.
9265 The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.
9266 I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.
9267 In short.
9268 I will not be going back here.
9269 Can't say enough about this place.
9270 We were amazed by the room and it's stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it.
9271 We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place.
9272 Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing.
9273 Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade.
9274 Always a marvelous experience.
9275 The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting.
9276 The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff.
9277 The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines.
9278 The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here.
9279 I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special.
9280 It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.
9281 I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.
9282 It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close.
9283 This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush.
9284 It was empty, and the lines were short.
9285 Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.
9286 This place is so good!
9287 I have eaten almost everything on the menu.
9288 It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money.
9289 I would recommend this place I go often.
9290 I'll start with the positive.
9291 They have some friendly members of staff.
9292 That's it.
9293 You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.
9294 It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.
9295 I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.
9296 It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.
9297 If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.
9298 If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else.
9299 The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner.
9300 But that's just aesthetics, I realize.
9301 The food is great.
9302 I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes.
9303 I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing.
9304 Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu.
9305 The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal.
9306 I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago.
9307 Yum.
9308 I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area?
9309 I think so.
9310 Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening.
9311 A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me.
9312 I'm just here to grub.
9313 EAT HERE.
9314 And ask for twice the spicy you would normally.
9315 The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.
9316 This place is too freaking cute!!!
9317 The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.
9318 I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.
9319 The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.
9320 I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.
9321 Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.
9322 I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!
9323 This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast.
9324 The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day.
9325 I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.
9326 I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye.
9327 I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed.
9328 My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added.
9329 The service is excellent there.
9330 You always get treated friendly and with a smile!
9331 Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.
9332 The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
9333 Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.
9334 Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.
9335 We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.
9336 We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.
9337 So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!)
9338 and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.
9339 These people think of everything.
9340 And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.
9341 The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.
9342 The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.
9343 My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.
9344 These are true professionals.
9345 Asparagus was cooked perfectly.
9346 The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.
9347 And the dessert?
9348 Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.
9349 Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.
9350 Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.
9351 The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.
9352 If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.
9353 Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.
9354 We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11.
9355 We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed.
9356 Not this time!
9357 Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.
9358 My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie.
9359 I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!
9360 This is what Rubios is about!
9361 This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.
9362 The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.
9363 They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.
9364 The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.
9365 The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.
9366 They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.
9367 The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.
9368 All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again.
9369 This company is Awesome!!!
9370 I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon.
9371 I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable.
9372 They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world.
9373 The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt.
9374 I will be visiting quite often.
9375 Thank you so much!
9376 John Paul D.
9377 This place does it right, but hold on to your walet!
9378 U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top.
9379 Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.
9380 Wine and booze selections are great too.
9381 Killer store like candyland for adults.
9382 Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.
9383 Great place!
9384 Just have to rave about Becca and Todd's Zoo tour on a Segway.
9385 It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale.
9386 I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks.
9387 We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour.
9388 It was fun, easy and worth every penny.
9389 Absolutely disgusting.
9390 I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.
9391 This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.
9392 Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.
9393 I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......
9394 Fabulous!
9395 This was my son- in -laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one.
9396 Lots of menu choices, a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left.
9397 We will return soon and often.
9398 Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!
9399 I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.
9400 Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.
9401 They are rockin'.
9402 I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!
9403 I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.
9404 For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!
9405 I always have a great time here!
9406 And now that you can't smoke it's even better!
9407 Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.
9408 I kinda found this place on accident.
9409 I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.
9410 Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.
9411 I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.
9412 Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).
9413 And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.
9414 How in the hell do they do it?
9415 I don't know, but I'm in love.
9416 Man oh Man!
9417 Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.
9418 I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for "decent".
9419 A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.
9420 While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.
9421 I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.
9422 I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.
9423 I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.
9424 We were a party of 7 and shared around.
9425 The food was fantastic!
9426 Dim sum was fresh and succulent.
9427 Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.
9428 The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.
9429 The tastes distinctive and delicious.
9430 The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.
9431 I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY.
9432 This food was comparable.
9433 I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.
9434 Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!
9435 Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!
9436 Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.
9437 Hooray for Phoenix Palace!
9438 We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.
9439 However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.
9440 The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.
9441 No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.
9442 Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.
9443 So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix.
9444 My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.
9445 Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.
9446 I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here.
9447 But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.
9448 GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!
9449 Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!
9450 This place has gone so downhill.
9451 If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out.
9452 Margaritas are always awesome.
9453 But the service and food is straight up AWFUL.
9454 Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill.
9455 The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water.
9456 After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again.
9457 They dont deserve your money either....
9458 First time here, new favorite.
9459 You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING.
9460 Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had.
9461 Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful.
9462 Monkey bread is also stellar.
9463 I cannot wait to go back.
9464 This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.
9465 I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.
9466 Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.
9467 Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.
9468 They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit 'slutty', but holy god.
9469 I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!!
9470 Yum, yum, yum!!!
9471 Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well.
9472 The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus.
9473 I can honestly say for the New Year, I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it.
9474 I'm never shopping here, I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it
9475 I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop.
9476 Everything here is fantastic.
9477 My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine.
9478 The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better... we are seriously tempted to each get our own order.
9479 (I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!
9480 ...No i'm not an only child... well, maybe I was until i was 11, how did you know.
9481 WAH!)
9482 Oh, and Laura is fantastic.
9483 She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room.
9484 Thursday's special is meat loaf... don't deny yourself, just indulge.
9485 :)
9486 Your reviews are hilarious!!
9487 (shoot--who was this referring to??)
9488 I try to avoid WM.
9489 I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.
9490 I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.
9491 I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.
9492 I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.
9493 He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.
9494 I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?
9495 I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.
9496 FINALLY, one asks if I need help???
9497 NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.
9498 FOOLS!
9499 On my last visit, a customer said "excuse me" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.
9500 I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.
9501 I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.
9502 Then one employee pipes up with "OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?"
9503 She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say "You're welcome", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: "THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
9504 NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.
9505 We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do."
9506 That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.
9507 WT?
9508 What's wrong w/this management??
9509 ?
9510 I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.
9511 There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.
9512 If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.
9513 I've drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, I've cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM.
9514 I am one step closer to completing my goal.
9515 I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.
9516 After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.
9517 We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.
9518 We arrived and were seated right away.
9519 Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.
9520 We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.
9521 A few minutes later we got our salad.
9522 It was really good.
9523 Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.
9524 It was a good starter.
9525 A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.
9526 If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.
9527 I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.
9528 Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.
9529 It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.
9530 Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.
9531 As good as I always remember it to be.
9532 Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)
9533 Their burgers may be getting smaller?
9534 Still delicious as ever.
9535 I pass on the drink though, an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..
9536 Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries
9537 (in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)
9538 I would eat here every day if I had the option.
9539 This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour.
9540 I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up.
9541 I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed.
9542 I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order.
9543 The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
9544 Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.
9545 Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.
9546 This restaurant has been here for 38 years.
9547 I've been going here off and on for 35 years.
9548 I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.
9549 The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.
9550 The rest of the decorations have been torn out.
9551 I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.
9552 I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years.
9553 Sadly, the food here is not all that good.
9554 The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.
9555 The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?
9556 too much soy sauce?)
9557 instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.
9558 The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.
9559 A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special "Chinese cakes" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.
9560 All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.
9561 If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.
9562 Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.
9563 Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on...
9564 Love this place, it's on our dinner rotation.
9565 The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars.
9566 Great place and cheap too.
9567 Try the #100 its the best ever.
9568 I don't know what's up with Eddie???
9569 I always found him to be pleasant, and really taking care of the customers.
9570 However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people, and they gave us one waitress.
9571 We sat down at 7:00 pm and our main course came at 9:15.
9572 No real big deal but one person can't handle a table of 19, and we were having fun.
9573 So one of the guest's had ordered the $12.00 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he can't stand it at all.
9574 The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it, and he tells the waitress.
9575 She was not at fault, and had written it down clearly.
9576 He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun.
9577 He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one.
9578 LOL.
9579 What's up Eddie???
9580 I don't understand at all, you take it off the bill because you screwed up, but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.
9581 Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people.
9582 My daughter has even taken one of your classes, and said what a great guy you are.
9583 Really, Really bad PR that night and the next birthday party wont be at Eddie's House.
9584 Great time that night, but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 people's mouth.
9585 Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.
9586 Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.
9587 Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of "big things in small packages," and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.
9588 Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's "Signature" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.
9589 Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.
9590 At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.
9591 Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.
9592 If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the "Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding," though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.
9593 Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.
9594 Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the "French Napoleon" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.
9595 Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see "Mille Feuille New York") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.
9596 It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.
9597 I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day.
9598 We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society.
9599 We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd.
9600 Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction.
9601 She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals.
9602 She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics.
9603 Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!!
9604 and dogs 67,000??!!!
9605 thats CRAZY and so compelling.
9606 Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies.
9607 It was very eye-opening.
9608 First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter.
9609 The animal accommodations are so impressive!!
9610 The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious.
9611 I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces.
9612 There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park!
9613 There are also private puppy rooms.
9614 The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors.
9615 The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals.
9616 We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs.
9617 The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday!
9618 buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.
9619 It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them
9620 Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience.
9621 My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.
9622 Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.
9623 If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.
9624 Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.
9625 The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.
9626 I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.
9627 But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.
9628 Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.
9629 You will thank me later.
9630 Q
9631 How very disappointing!
9632 Nello's had a delightful menu with an array of salads, pizzas and sandwiches.
9633 Not Jac's.
9634 If the new restaurant wants to be a "pub", it should have a wider variety of selections.
9635 The menu was sad.
9636 Due to dietary restrictions, I asked for a plain garden salad.
9637 Lettuce, tomatoes and onions.
9638 And it wasn't very fresh either.
9639 Sad.
9640 Guess we'll be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nello's.
9641 I highly reccomend this place.
9642 They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund.
9643 We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions.
9644 Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
9645 My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular!
9646 Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.
9647 The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!
9648 There's no business like show business.
9649 As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie.
9650 I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent.
9651 lol!
9652 Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could.
9653 I am not even joking on that.
9654 I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again.
9655 LOL!
9656 Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.
9657    My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are.
9658 This is children's theater at it's best!
9659 The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus.
9660 The kids love it.
9661 I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show.
9662 I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students.
9663 Teehee!
9664 ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)
9665    I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay.
9666 Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors.
9667 Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them!
9668 LOVE YOU!
9669    Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools.
9670 We have had an artist at our school for several years.
9671 It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future.
9672 Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.
9673    Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility.
9674 You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent.
9675 What more can you ask for?
9676    The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families.
9677 But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets.
9678 A great way to start viewing them and get involved.
9679     I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az.
9680 As I have stated in my other "ARTS" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts.
9681 Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, "Go, On With The Show".
9682 Great donuts but horrible service...
9683 Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee.
9684 She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish.
9685 She understood ONLY the word "dozen" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone!
9686 Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa.
9687 Great great food.
9688 Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale.
9689 I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!
9690 I took my man here for "mystery date night" as a surprise since he had never been.
9691 No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes!
9692 take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.
9693 I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.
9694 We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.
9695 The wine was tasty and reasonable.
9696 I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.
9697 It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!
9698 Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.
9699 It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.
9700 It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.
9701 It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!
9702 So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.
9703 I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.
9704 I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.
9705 I would never eat here without dessert again!
9706 I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.
9707 You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)
9708 So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake.
9709 Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something.
9710 Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit.
9711 However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee.
9712 I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat.
9713 I am always comfortable in Michelina's, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to "turn the table".
9714 Michelina's cooking is fantastic!
9715 Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.
9716 The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.
9717 One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!
9718 I am a hot dog lover.
9719 For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet.
9720 Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere.
9721 I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive.
9722 This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic.
9723 The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce.
9724 And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled.
9725 Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.
9726 Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.
9727 The dolma's were the best I've had, their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.
9728 The entertainment was great.
9729 Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.
9730 Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan, vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that, you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?)
9731 Also, the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.
9732 Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiya's carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things.
9733 Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there.
9734 The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping.
9735 What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they'll have it available and ready.
9736 I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry.
9737 It's no wonder I've been coming here year after year.
9738 Sorry Banana Leaf...
9739 I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.
9740 Really... it was almost not edible.
9741 The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.
9742 Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!
9743 Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!
9744 I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.
9745 I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.
9746 So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.
9747 First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.
9748 Sorry Banana Leaf!
9749 I would absolutely not recommend living here.
9750 I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS.
9751 When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week.
9752 They didn't give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just weren't very nice.
9753 I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment!
9754 The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off.
9755 The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too.
9756 One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage!
9757 it was a total nightmare.
9758 Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized.
9759 But---I wouldn't take the chance.
9760 For the same price, you can definitely find somewhere better to live.
9761 What a great find!
9762 Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road.
9763 Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case.
9764 The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TV's, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead.
9765 The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal.
9766 My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom.
9767 The menu has great variety.
9768 The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls.
9769 The Tom Ka soup was excellent.
9770 Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy.
9771 We will be back.
9772 Pricing was very reasonable.
9773 There is patio seating available.
9774 Check it out.
9775 Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito.
9776 My friend has been there several times and loves this place.
9777 After having a few beers, we were pretty hungry and decited to go here.
9778 This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop.
9779 Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside.
9780 Customer service was excellent.
9781 The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food.
9782 Great concept for something different.
9783 For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink).
9784 It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie.
9785 Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table.
9786 I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl).
9787 The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it.
9788 Enough to make me sweat a little.
9789 One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean.
9790 Sweeping, cleaning the tables, wiping up around the drink dispensers.
9791 I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free.
9792 One last thing, they have free wifi!
9793 Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens.
9794 Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix!
9795 Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name!
9796 The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint.
9797 I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!
9798 The Tofu dishes are amazing.
9799 How do you learn to love Okra?
9800 Get it at Sens.
9801 The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts.
9802 One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!
9803 I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an "Asian Sangria"?
9804 C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!
9805 Great home made taste on the meatballs.
9806 Also they have diet coke.
9807 Shop was nice and clean.
9808 Friendly and fast service
9809 I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid.
9810 I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.
9811 What can I say except that Jodi is incredible.
9812 I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half.
9813 I sent her a message and she quickly responded.
9814 Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me.
9815 You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate.
9816 I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies.
9817 That day I saw Erica.
9818 She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair.
9819 For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you.
9820 It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable.
9821 It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots.
9822 Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body.
9823 Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot.
9824 Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer.
9825 I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set.
9826 Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do.
9827 Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease.
9828 I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me.
9829 It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well.
9830 The overall whole experience was incredible.
9831 I felt sexy and confident.
9832 I went back with my honey to look at the photos.
9833 He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album.
9834 I can't wait to see everything finished.
9835 I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience.
9836 I highly recommend her and her ladies!!
9837 !
9838 The best burgers in Phoenix.
9839 The owners are great and am on a first name basis.
9840 Forget about fast food and support this local business.
9841 Go double.
9842 Add bacon.
9843 Park at Circle K if in a hurry.
9844 Plan on holding it until you get home.
9845 Stick to the burger and fries, genius.
9846 I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.
9847 Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.
9848 It seems like a great idea.
9849 It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.
9850 They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....
9851 I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms.
9852 tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.
9853 I added bacon for a dollar.
9854 First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.
9855 I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food.
9856 This would not be a big deal if:
9857 1.
9858 I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch?
9859 ?
9860 2.
9861 They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.
9862 3.
9863 They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.
9864 You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.
9865 At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?
9866 Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.
9867 I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????
9868 He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!
9869 Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.
9870 I finally get my burger!
9871 YAY!!
9872 I'm SO excited!
9873 All those 4 and 5 star reviews!
9874 I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.
9875 WTH?
9876 I look at the patty.
9877 It's clean as a whistle.
9878 I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.
9879 I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.
9880 The other side is clean too.
9881 The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!
9882 Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.
9883 Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.
9884 Just oil.
9885 Tons and tons of oil.
9886 I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.
9887 The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.
9888 I'm grossed out, but hungry.
9889 I take a bite.
9890 It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.
9891 BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?
9892 Not there.
9893 I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese.
9894 or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste.
9895 So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.
9896 This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.
9897 I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.
9898 Now I recognize the flavor.
9899 I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.
9900 At this point, I turn to the fries.
9901 The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.
9902 I couldn't get out of there fast enough!
9903 Forget my danged dollar!
9904 just get me in the car!
9905 Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea
9906 I haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!
9907 No.
9908 NO.
9909 A thousand times NO!
9910 Red Robin is my next burger stop.
9911 Period
9912 So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.
9913 I removed my acrylics myself last week.
9914 I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.
9915 You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.
9916 Not this place!
9917 There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.
9918 It's bigger than the place I had been going to!
9919 Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!
9920 That was nice.
9921 Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.
9922 I had Le.
9923 She was so sweet!
9924 I told her all about my date, too.
9925 She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.
9926 Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.
9927 I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.
9928 Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
9929 She was quick but *really* methodical.
9930 I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!
9931 She even called me by name throughout the conversation.
9932 $25 for a new full set.
9933 Not bad at all
9934 Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!)..
9935 I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it.
9936 Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome!
9937 I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood..
9938 I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!
9939 Extras on tables to get your Pho on..
9940 Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy!
9941 AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)
9942 My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night.
9943 Although the customer service was slow and average at best, the food was outstanding.
9944 I had a burger and my wife the steak salad.
9945 I was the DD, but my wife said the margaritas were excellent.
9946 Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake.
9947 Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance.
9948 Ok, so I have to share my morning experience.
9949 But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron.
9950 Honest.
9951 So, this morning I stopped for gas.
9952 My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work.
9953 That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank.
9954 From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby.
9955 Perfect.
9956 I had stopped there before.
9957 But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School.
9958 Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station.
9959 I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle.
9960 Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option.
9961 The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling.
9962 "Wow," I thought, "It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."
9963 So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened.
9964 I kept hitting the grade button.
9965 It kept beeping back at me.
9966 Still nothing.
9967 To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle.
9968 I had never seen anything like it.
9969 Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one.
9970 That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser.
9971 I approached with curiously.
9972 That's when I realized.
9973 You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump.
9974 Ah-ha.
9975 This is how this station works.
9976 So, I did just that.
9977 I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank.
9978 Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days.
9979 Only, it wasn't pumping.
9980 The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank.
9981 UGH.
9982 So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas.
9983 Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card.
9984 Only, no receipt came out.
9985 I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off.
9986 Stupid ampm station.
9987 Since when does any gas station benefit from being different?
9988 I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go.
9989 Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this.
9990 There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way.
9991 Grr.
9992 Screw this.
9993 I'm never going back there again.
9994 (Disclaimer: Said writer of review graduated high school with a 3.98 G.P.A  and attended a well accredited college of her choice, where you went on to graduate with honors, having made the Dean's and President's Honor roll more than once.
9995 Said writer of review also has street smarts and is able to saddle and ride a horse, do unimaginable cool things with a twisty tie and throw some mean Muay Thai elbows.)
9996 Sauce is my kind of place.
9997 Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.
9998 Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.
9999 I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.
10000 This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.
10001 If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.
10002 Wow.
10003 Worst food poisoning of my life.
10004 Ate here Saturday night for my birthday.
10005 Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward.
10006 Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick.
10007 I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day.
10008 Stay away from the salmon.
10009 I for one will never go back.
10010 I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews.
10011 Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality.
10012 I should have listened!
10013 !
10014 Loved it!
10015 Best French toast ever!
10016 I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender.
10017 They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program.
10018 They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful.
10019 I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed.
10020 This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by.
10021 If you have a choice, choose Harvil's.
10022 You won't be disappointed.
10023 Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery.
10024 Great subs, the Club Supreme mike's style was really good
10025 This is a car wash that I would highly recommend.
10026 They do a great job, and pay attention to the details.
10027 It costs a little more at Hot Shots, but it's worth it.
10028 It takes a bit more time, too- but worth it.
10029 The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time.
10030 Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.
10031 Part of her personality is what kept me coming back.
10032 Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.
10033 Flawless.
10034 In years past, she has altered all of my "work attire."
10035 I have since moved, but whenever I return home, if I ever need any work done I will bring it with.
10036 Nadya, you are a wonderful person, and any recommendation I can send your way I will!
10037 Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu.
10038 I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch.
10039 I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights.
10040 I've never ever had a bad meal.
10041 In fact, I always have a hard time deciding.
10042 Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet.
10043 I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's!
10044 I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since!
10045 But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte.
10046 Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it!
10047 Bon Appetite!
10048 LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with film
10049 critics today???
10050 ?
10051 For so many reasons, Costco is top notch but I'm going to review their Opto department.
10052 They are equally as stellar!
10053 Dr. Tieu is super friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable.
10054 The retail part has the best pricing on contacts, frames and lenses compared to any competitor.
10055 Lucky me they take my insurance and my yearly supply of contacts came to a big fat $0 after rebates.
10056 Always ask about rebates for contacts, both the Dr office and the retail desk will usually have some that you can combine!
10057 Horrible experience.
10058 We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days.
10059 We referred to them by a friend.
10060 We explained to them we're Seniors on limited income but assured them they'd be paid in full.
10061 We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid.
10062 But, No, No, NO!!!!
10063 "Not our policy"  They were holding our two kids for ransom!!
10064 !
10065 Horrible, uncaring staff to deal with.
10066 This place is the classic bait and switch joint.
10067 I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a "buy one-get one free" Chicken Tender Sandwich,  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon.
10068 The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long.
10069 The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated .
10070 .
10071 .uhh, I mean grown.
10072 This wasn't the first time the server manager did this to me.
10073 I should have known better.
10074 I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one, get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon.
10075 My bad!
10076 When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite, the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.
10077 If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better, go to smash burger.
10078 As for this place, never, never  again.
10079 The only good Carl's Jr.
10080 I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.
10081 From the Manager down, they strive to live up to their advertising.
10082 Great posole - and the kids love their bean and cheese burritos.
10083 That's all we have eaten no need to venture further on the menu.
10084 Great hangover food.
10085 The staff is always very friendly!
10086 I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it?
10087 I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.
10088 Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.
10089 Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.
10090 Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.
10091 I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?)
10092 With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?)
10093 The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day.
10094 Such a horrible taste.
10095 The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste.
10096 There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice.
10097 This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.
10098 They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.
10099 But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce.
10100 So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.
10101 Not good.
10102 And it's not been for a couple of years.
10103 There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups.
10104 But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.
10105 When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.
10106 Only 2 beers on tap.
10107 Garbage.
10108 Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory.
10109 It is just that good.
10110 My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years.
10111 However, I simply couldn't put it off any longer.
10112 With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times.
10113 I went in not knowing what to expect.
10114 Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease.
10115 I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist.
10116 She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry.
10117 There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying.
10118 Then the scary part... the dental work.
10119 It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasn't that bad and I felt a thousand times better.
10120 Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of.
10121 Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price!
10122 But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than I'd been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems.
10123 In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isn't a dentist looking to take advantage of you.
10124 I couldn't have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office.
10125 The convenient downtown location only makes it better.
10126 I will never go to another dentist again and I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment.
10127 I can't recommend this office enough.
10128 This review if for their happy hour because that's all that I've experienced.
10129 Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.
10130 I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.
10131 I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque.
10132 Good food
10133 Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix.
10134 It happened to me when I least expected.
10135 I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job.
10136 Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different.
10137 When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes.
10138 A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork.
10139 One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust.
10140 It later turned into love and I've been happy every since.
10141 I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat.
10142 Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion.
10143 I've purchased the "basic" cake for birthday parties.
10144 Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind.
10145 When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go.
10146 I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table.
10147 And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake.
10148 It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top.
10149 Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys.
10150 It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite.
10151 It was just as good as it looked if not better.
10152 Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite.
10153 The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower.
10154 One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand.
10155 As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced.
10156 Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it.
10157 I promise.
10158 Food is outstanding!
10159 Rebecca rocks!!!!!
10160 !
10161 I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty.
10162 And the mac here, well it's high quality.
10163 I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive.
10164 Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese.
10165 It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it.
10166 FEZ should stand for Fabulous Exotic ZExperience.
10167 I was planning on making it here for ages but couldnt until I found out the new metro rail is ride outside!!
10168 I needed a quiet place to read and was much obliged when they turned off all music by my request.
10169 I was able to read my Nancy Bartholomew novles with great intensity.
10170 The staff left me alone for hours and the intoxicating rosemary smell really opened my buds.
10171 The atmosphere is definatly trendy, After I finnaly soaked it all in, I would def give this place 5 stars although I didnt try the food or bar.
10172 Better than Starbucks anyday!
10173 The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as "The Annihilator"..
10174 My personal Favorite: "The Cookie with a little raspberry"
10175 Get ready to get meat drunk, then fall into a meat coma!!
10176 Although this is not a nationwide chain, this is what a chain restaurant can and should be, it's great.
10177 You begin with an immaculate salad bar.
10178 Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter.
10179 Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy.
10180 Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!!
10181 Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close.
10182 It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly.
10183 You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it.
10184 This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol.
10185 And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!!
10186 I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!
10187 !
10188 Yum!
10189 I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them!
10190 We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce).
10191 Amazing!
10192 Great flavors!
10193 Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here!
10194 Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat).
10195 Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things.
10196 Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise.
10197 Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite.
10198 Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual.
10199 Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks.
10200 Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz.
10201 Excited to go back and try some more pizza!
10202 I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough.
10203 There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives, which is obviously key in any knife purchase.
10204 If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping, blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit.
10205 I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping, which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase.
10206 Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.
10207 She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.
10208 Bottom line, go in, tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance), and get better tools for the job.
10209 It's well worth it.
10210 I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened, either by hand or on the grinding wheel.
10211 Today I had four knives sharpened, three on the wheel, one by hand, and two with tip damage.
10212 Total cost = $13.
10213 Bonus: purchases are tax free.
10214 Highly recommended.
10215 WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie's for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.
10216 We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut....
10217 WONDERFUL!!!!!
10218 My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.
10219 Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az.
10220 Will never eat here again.
10221 Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced.
10222 On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was.
10223 Horrible first time experience!
10224 Saw this place in the Yelp email.
10225 Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.
10226 I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.
10227 I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.
10228 There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.
10229 The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.
10230 My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.
10231 We shared his fries and the shake.
10232 OMG - the burger was heavenly!
10233 The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.
10234 It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!
10235 The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.
10236 The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.
10237 And the prices were outstanding!
10238 Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.
10239 I'd eat there all the time!
10240 Five Guys?
10241 Forget em!!
10242 !
10243 Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety.
10244 I didn't care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasn't very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!
10245 We recently had a pleasure trip to AZ and I booked at the Fairmont Princess and I must say I made an AWESOME choice!
10246 - Room was I guess a standard King but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio.
10247 The decor looked fresh and new as well.
10248 Very contemporary.
10249 Lovely.
10250 We were in building C and overlooked the rose/aroma garden which was quite quiet and pretty.
10251 Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less.
10252 - Pools were the best.
10253 We swam in the main south pool, the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well.
10254 Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell you...night swimming rules!
10255 We rarely get to do where I live.
10256 - Restaurants and bars were very good...if a bit pricey...as well.
10257 We had dinner at Bourdon Steak by Michael Mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance.
10258 Ate at Hacienda Restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table.
10259 Kinda liked eating at the bar better.
10260 Yum of the drinks.
10261 - Great trip....great place...we will be back!
10262 My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito.
10263 The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy.
10264 Nice stop for a quick bite.
10265 I'm a girl who knows her way around a donut.
10266 The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home.
10267 I was also super scared for my waistband.
10268 Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley.
10269 Not that there is a ton of competition but still.
10270 They're really good.
10271 They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed, filled to fritters.
10272 My favorite is the glazed twist.
10273 So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it.
10274 Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you're not stuck with only the coconut donuts.
10275 I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co-workers gobbled them up.
10276 Who doesn't love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven?
10277 I'm sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time.
10278 Next Door Realty is fantastic!
10279 Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth.
10280 From start to finish she was an excellent communicator.
10281 She took all of our concerns into account and made the process a breeze for us.
10282 I would highly recommend Next Door to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.
10283 The personal attention you receive is unparalleled!
10284 We happened upon this place on Sunday.
10285 We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry.
10286 We quickly ducked into Zinburger.
10287 All three of us had burgers.
10288 The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries.
10289 We also ordered the sweet potato fries.
10290 The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious.
10291 I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries.
10292 We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm.
10293 We told the waiter we were in a hurry.
10294 He was great, friendly and accommodating.
10295 We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there.
10296 Everyone was so nice.
10297 My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare.
10298 It still tasted yummy and I ate it.
10299 Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger.
10300 Addicted to duck fat fries!
10301 Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries.
10302 Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are?
10303 You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries.
10304 They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go.
10305 Nope.
10306 Don't go.
10307 I guess I should mention the rest of the menu.
10308 Everything is awesome.
10309 Nutella rules!
10310 Seriously.
10311 This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right.
10312 I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it.
10313 Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious.
10314 I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great.
10315 There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!
10316 I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness!
10317 All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else.
10318 I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam!
10319 BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection.
10320 I'm actually craving it as I type this.
10321 For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar.
10322 What I like about this place are the choices.
10323 I usually don't have any issues, I'm a mint chocolate chip man, and that's typically what I order.
10324 My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings.
10325 This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we've been too.
10326 For those of you who are calorie conscience, as I am, they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what you're getting.
10327 John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly.
10328 John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable.
10329 He has a customer for life from me.
10330 The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since...
10331 Started with getting them catered for lunch, then a trip here or there to the restaurant.
10332 SO.
10333 GOOD.
10334 The bread is amazing, but the love, sweat, tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting.
10335 Hmmm, now I am wondering what it is they put in there??
10336 Anyway, I won't think too long and hard about that one.
10337 But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter, gotta feed the addiction.
10338 We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently.
10339 A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky.
10340 The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.
10341 I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now.
10342 If you're at all a "Foodie" you can't come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.
10343 The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.
10344 I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.
10345 Food....have anything.
10346 Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.
10347 My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently.
10348 This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.
10349 Side note...this was way cool.
10350 On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.
10351 So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.
10352 When we're seated about 15 min.
10353 later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.
10354 Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.
10355 Much appreciated service.
10356 What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here.
10357 We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here.
10358 So, yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.
10359 And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.
10360 Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... you'll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too.
10361 PS get the three meat calzone.
10362 You look great and can afford the calories...
10363 What an awesome business!
10364 Friendly, knowledgable people that make you feel like family when you come in.
10365 I can't to tell you how refreshing it is to walk into an audition and feel welcomed!
10366 Auditioning is a scary enough experience without feeling intimidated by your environment and the people auditioning you.
10367 Here you'll find great people who love what they do and have an extensive amount of knowledge and experience.
10368 Oh, and I also recommend taking one of Faith's workshops...
10369 I took one recently and I learned some very valuable tools that will definitely help me in future auditions :D
10370 Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars.
10371 We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer.
10372 The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal.
10373 I ordered the marinated chicken.
10374 This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.
10375 The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again.
10376 My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes.
10377 For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart.
10378 Just delicious.
10379 The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly.
10380 It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed.
10381 Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!
10382 Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.
10383 The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.
10384 Love the idea - vegan Mexican.
10385 Have tried to eat there twice.
10386 Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed.
10387 Called their phone number, no one answered.
10388 No sign, no explanation on FB.
10389 Pathetic.
10390 bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool.
10391 plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework.
10392 the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.
10393 it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent.
10394 the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...
10395 if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy.
10396 it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.
10397 customer service is very nice and helpful.
10398 I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as "My Favorite Restaurant" - that's a big title to carry.
10399 I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.
10400 They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.
10401 Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it.
10402 Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it.
10403 It literally melts in your mouth!
10404 Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to.
10405 The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange.
10406 I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!)
10407 - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar.
10408 Bobby Q is GREAT!
10409 We enjoyed EVERYTHING: brisket sandwich, baby back ribs, brisket with spicy sauce - yum!!!
10410 Blooming onion - just right!
10411 Baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  withe barbeque pork and the fixings......mmmmmmmm!
10412 Our waitress perfect - Go - now!
10413 This store made me feel like I had died and went to fabric heaven.
10414 There is just so much beautiful, wonderful, amazing fabric.
10415 I dropped a pretty penny- but I've already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects.
10416 The place is clean, the staff is super friendly and patient- especially with newbies like me.
10417 When I brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much I needed- patience came with a smile.
10418 It seems like everything (even the high end designers) are around $10/yard.
10419 If you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with, they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say "get your paws off my fabric" which made me chuckle.
10420 Maybe I'm turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that.
10421 Despite the somewhat sketchy location, 35th Ave. Sew and Vac is my new go-to for fabric!
10422 Bad music, slow service, disgusting overpriced drinks, and annoying patrons.
10423 Definitely wouldn't come back if someone paid me to.
10424 I can't even drink this margarita.
10425 Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs.
10426 The owners are equally amazing.
10427 They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing.
10428 My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house.
10429 The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions.
10430 There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots.
10431 I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else.
10432 Everything is always fresh and delicious.
10433 Their happy hour is awesome as well.
10434 I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice.
10435 But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free.
10436 and they are DELICIOUS!
10437 Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life.
10438 Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco.
10439 I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.
10440  Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be.
10441 the flavor is true to pizza crust!
10442 my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.
10443 There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves.
10444 The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box.
10445 I love it.
10446 If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place.
10447 Totally worth the drive, and the money.
10448 But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!
10449 Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.
10450 They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.
10451 Prices are steep.
10452 After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.
10453 I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star.
10454 We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.
10455 We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.
10456 They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA).
10457 I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.
10458 We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.
10459 So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.
10460 We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)
10461 and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction).
10462 Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.
10463 Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.
10464 VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.
10465 Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.
10466 Now being added into the rotation.
10467 Thank you Main Ingredient!
10468 : )
10469 Yummy yummy yummy!
10470 Absolutely loved it - kick back, quiet, people nice, not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy!
10471 My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 8,2012 to celebrate our one year anniversary.
10472 Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary.
10473 We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt.
10474 Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional.
10475 We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately.
10476 The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!!
10477 Thank you Meling Pot.
10478 We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!
10479 !
10480 Cute busy place in Central Phoenix.
10481 Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic.
10482 Simple and sweet.
10483 Staff is well versed in Japanese food, if you haven't had it in years ask.
10484 Great staff, great food, great times.
10485 I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.
10486 My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.
10487 Never Again,
10488 I brought my Mountain Bike in (which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart) to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes.)
10489 I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away, the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake.
10490 When I returned and told them about it, I was told the back wheel was not true.
10491 It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart.
10492 I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place.
10493 I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in.
10494 Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible!
10495 I've been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time.
10496 The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that it's blistered.
10497 (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so it's not infected.)
10498 Also, when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate.
10499 NOT NORMAL!
10500 I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed, so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway.
10501 I'm not going back there again.
10502 In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.
10503 Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.
10504 The food was amazing.
10505 Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.
10506 Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!
10507 Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.
10508 Highly recommended.
10509 I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley, and this is the best one I've been to, by far.
10510 The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.
10511 The rolls were pretty good, but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho, not too far from this place.
10512 BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic, but I digress).
10513 I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van, but it all looked pretty good too.
10514 The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).
10515 I want to come back, but it's not close to my house.
10516 However, it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving.
10517 Count us in for a #5 Combo, a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!
10518 Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!
10519 Always busy at lunch, but they get through the orders in a timely manner.
10520 Seating can be tricky, so have one order and another stalk tables!
10521 :)
10522 You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI.
10523 My boss asked me to find someone to clean the office windows (about 50 large panes) inside and out, so I got in touch with Brad.
10524 He was very professional throughout the experience, and his mastery of this craft is phenomenal.
10525 The windows were crystal clear within a few hours; he did a very thorough job.
10526 Punctual, efficient, and easy to work with--his rate was very competitive, and his work is worth every penny!
10527 The office looks brand new.
10528 Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful.
10529 Though I do think they are a bit understaffed, they were gracious and friendly.
10530 Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores.
10531 Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco.
10532 Everyone's really helpful and friendly.
10533 We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
10534 Enterprise Pools keeps my pool looking PERFECT for swimming!
10535 Not only do they preform top-notch weekly service, sweeping, clearing the baskets and making sure the chemicals are right, but they are great at communicating.
10536 One of the tough things about owning a pool and not being a pool expert is knowing what's going on.
10537 They always take the time to explain what's happening in a way I can understand.
10538 Broken pump or filter?
10539 No problem!
10540 They do repairs too.
10541 They'll even fill you in on what you need to do as the seasons change, or how to handle those pesky, pool destroying, monsoon storms!
10542 Two words for you.
10543 Mouth.
10544 Orgasm
10545 Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary.
10546 I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down.
10547 We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate.
10548 They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.
10549 I went with the 5 course menu.
10550 I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three.
10551 We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal!
10552 It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast.
10553 If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human.
10554 The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo.
10555 It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now.
10556 Holey cow!
10557 Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper.
10558 Another amazing dish.
10559 My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special.
10560 I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good.
10561 I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes.
10562 The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin.
10563 It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg.
10564 I felt it was just too much, a little clunky.
10565 That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish.
10566 I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta.
10567 Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.
10568 We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional.
10569 The service was excellent.
10570 At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe.
10571 What a great meal, fargin amazing!!
10572 Pics to come
10573 Best TexMex in the valley!
10574 The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten.
10575 I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try.
10576 Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).
10577 Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.
10578 The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.
10579 We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).
10580 Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.
10581 A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.
10582 For food, we tried most of the HH specials.
10583 Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.
10584 The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.
10585 Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.
10586 She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!
10587 The happy rice on the side was great too.
10588 My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.
10589 I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!
10590 Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.
10591 Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.
10592 Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.
10593 Aloha Hour is a must.
10594 Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.
10595 We had a great night.
10596 Troy, the owner, is a brilliant businessman!
10597 Being a pharmacist myself, I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility.
10598 Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley.
10599 After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training, I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy.
10600 The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations.
10601 My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take.
10602 Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if you're having health issues that aren't being adequately addressed.
10603 Troy is one of the best in the Valley.
10604 It's worth the drive to consult with him, and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home.
10605 I love this restaurant concept.
10606 It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family.
10607 I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I don't have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience.
10608 The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh, which is important to me.
10609 The broth is so flavorful.
10610 But be warned weak tongued restaurant-goers, the spicy broth has a kick that will stick!
10611 Some are saying it's too expensive?
10612 I think it's worth it.
10613 Don't let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.
10614 Baiz market has some of the best food in town.
10615 The small deli (cafe?
10616 Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.
10617 the prices are cheap, The service is snappy and friendly, and the food is exceptional, especially considering the price.
10618 Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or, just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.
10619 Even if you've stuffed yourself silly, wander on back to the bakery.
10620 The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets can't be matched anywhere in town.
10621 Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients.
10622 This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.
10623 The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.
10624 Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.
10625 The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.
10626 Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.
10627 They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.
10628 Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.
10629 One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.
10630 Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.
10631 The service has always been really good.
10632 I love LOTS of things on the menu.
10633 The dixie pan fried chicken is great.
10634 There's a great little sticky bun that comes with it.
10635 The Del mar salad is great.
10636 I've had great experiences going to chelsea's kitchen.
10637 Overall it's in my heavy rotation on places I always say YES, let's go there!
10638 A very reliable local garage.
10639 Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile.
10640 He deflated my fears about "being taken" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance.
10641 He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it.
10642 I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive.
10643 Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop.
10644 Of all the Chipotle's I really like this one.
10645 The staff is exceptionally friendly and I don't think I've ever been in the place, and I've"ve been a lot, where they weren't meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds.
10646 Dig it!
10647 Good beers on tap.
10648 Tasty food.
10649 Friendly servers.
10650 Cool place to hang out and relax.
10651 My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce.
10652 Don't forget to check out the desserts.
10653 Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular.
10654 If you haven't checked it out, you should.
10655 I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends.
10656 How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?
10657 Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.
10658 I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.
10659 I eat there to much.
10660 Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live, but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...
10661 Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this -
10662 Sweet pork burrito with black beans, hot sauce, enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ...
10663 I don't)
10664 Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad.
10665 Until now!
10666 The atmosphere is very modern.
10667 The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes.
10668 Impressive.
10669 I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter.
10670 I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good.
10671 So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home.
10672 1 star for service and attitude.The food was delicious , but the staff was very hateful.
10673 I am writing this review.
10674 I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short , hispanic , and she was pregnant at the time.
10675 She was incredibly hateful.So hateful and rude to me and my parents.
10676 I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered.
10677 I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse.
10678 So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked , but that really wasn't the case.I went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently.
10679 More "manly" (ha).
10680 Different waitresses , same great food , same hateful attitudes.
10681 I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service.
10682 Great Job!
10683 Wait a second...I have not written a review!
10684 This is nuts!!!!
10685 !
10686 Anyways...I adore this place.
10687 LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.
10688 It is nuts!
10689 Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!
10690 This place can never go wrong!
10691 The orange and fennel salad it amazing!
10692 It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!
10693 I often get this salad through out the week.
10694 I love the kale and quinoa salad too!
10695 It is my go to salad.
10696 I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.
10697 I wish I could get enough but I cannot!
10698 The ambiance is awesome!
10699 Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.
10700 I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.
10701 The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!
10702 Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!
10703 OMG OMG OMG!!
10704 There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!
10705 I try to refuse every time but I cannot.
10706 I really enjoy the sangria.
10707 The wine selection is great!
10708 I just love this place!!!
10709 !
10710 The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player (will be crowded for sure).
10711 the experience is just really neat though, the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia, definitely the place to go if you're a visiting sports fan in scottsdale
10712 Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride.
10713 As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need.
10714 The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be.
10715 On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but I've had better.
10716 What I should have gotten was the shepards pie.
10717 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good.
10718 I'm going to go back, just get it on my own.
10719 Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks.
10720 Good place to get sauced before hitting a club.
10721 We attended this event today and loved it!
10722 The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded.
10723 This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry, there will be food near by.
10724 The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain.
10725 There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy.
10726 I should have done this so long ago, but we forget our Doctor's need reviews too!
10727 I've sent my boyfriend, my family and my friend's to her.
10728 You should know about her too!
10729 I've been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years!
10730 She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright, smiling, genuine and just overall warm!
10731 You want to thank her and hug her at the same time.
10732 Her staff is professional and friendly.
10733 Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job.
10734 I've followed Dr. Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else.
10735 She's helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed!
10736 What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is!
10737 I take my son to her now and he isn't afraid to go in.
10738 Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well, and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!
10739 Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I can't call it a "hot dog" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog.
10740 And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than "a hot dog" the way most people know hot dogs.
10741 Know what I mean?
10742 No?
10743 Well, go have a Short Leash Dog.
10744 Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie...
10745 My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!
10746 ).
10747 You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food.
10748 And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service!
10749 What's not to love?
10750 Normally have had great service & food here, but on Father's Day, Nicole H was simply horrible.
10751 Rude, slow, non-helpful, etc.
10752 Just a total fail.
10753 A different food-deliverer brought out food and "auctioned it off" (didn't know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didn't bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didn't notice, so I had to bring it up to her.
10754 Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.
10755 Nothing special at all.
10756 And for $12???!?!?!??!?!
10757 SHAME.
10758 The coq au vin was great.
10759 WHY IS THERE NO "CONTACT US"/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE????
10760 ?
10761 Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.
10762 1.
10763 Of the countless times I've flown with them, my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour.
10764 2.
10765 NO BAG FEES.
10766 3.
10767 Nine times out of ten the lowest price.
10768 4.
10769 Killer customer service, laced with sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency.
10770 I love it.
10771 5.
10772 They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.
10773 Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants.
10774 i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is.
10775 I like this one alot better then ours.
10776 BACON, people!
10777 Spicy Italian sausages, brats, even heirloom veggies by the pound?
10778 Locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use?
10779 I have found my personal piggy promised land and it is The Meat Shop.
10780 I headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer.
10781 We were quite pleased.
10782 The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats, cuts, and preparation.
10783 We grilled up everything that night - the sausages, the brats, the veggies... even the bacon... because, why not?
10784 I think we spent a grand total of $20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast.
10785 This place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff you'll find in the grocery store.
10786 I can't wait to head back over for round 2!
10787 Love this place!
10788 Their slices are delicious (and HUGE) and a great deal.
10789 Service is always fast and good.
10790 Their loyalty programs (frequent visits and VIP card) are also great.
10791 The fact that they're locally owned and support the local community doesn't hurt either.
10792 :)
10793 It's basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays.
10794 1 slice is more than enough, and I love that I can get it just the way that I want.
10795 If you're a member of their VIP program (free to join) you can also get the slices for dinner too.
10796 I love the Tempe Library.
10797 The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful.
10798 Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun.
10799 I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds.
10800 I am in love.
10801 This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.
10802 Ambiance, service and product were good.
10803 The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.
10804 My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.
10805 Two had the short ribs.
10806 Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.
10807 One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.
10808 My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.
10809 For an app I split the chop salad.
10810 It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.
10811 For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.
10812 The beverages deserve some mention.
10813 The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.
10814 There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.
10815 The beer selection is well crafted.
10816 I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.
10817 I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.
10818 Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.
10819 OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did.
10820 I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed.
10821 Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable.
10822 I got an iced soy latte and it was so good.
10823 I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso.
10824 This place just has great tasting espresso.
10825 I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself.
10826 You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not.
10827 I prefer to leave that to the professionals.
10828 He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink.
10829 If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about.
10830 You will notice how much better the espresso is.
10831 The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing.
10832 If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden.
10833 It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop.
10834 Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book.
10835 Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night.
10836 This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd.
10837 Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try.
10838 When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier.
10839 I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...
10840 Bottom line: Great atmosphere, drinks, and service!
10841 These guys are great.
10842 I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.
10843 It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.
10844 I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!
10845 Super!
10846 Best value for your money,   Clean, comfy beds.
10847 Quite.
10848 Great breakfast that is included.
10849 They don't serve food, they serve sex on a plate.
10850 At first glance the place looks like a hallway but it's really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places don't have Pasty's.
10851 The service is fast , friendly, and the music is off the chain.
10852 The food is not to be forgotten though, there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions.
10853 I only wish the place was bigger, there have been times when I've  had to wait for a space to open up but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
10854 That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company.
10855 This is a great breakfast stop!
10856 Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!
10857 Awesome!
10858 CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.
10859 The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.
10860 They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!
10861 Kindred Spirits has closed their doors.
10862 It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience.
10863 The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed.
10864 Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place.
10865 I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business.
10866 Wife and I had the large burgers.
10867 Many options as to toppings, whole grain bun is also an option.
10868 Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful.
10869 I had sw style w/guacamole and jalapeno, spouse chose classic american cheeseburger.
10870 We ordered sweet potato fries to split.
10871 They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 1/2 people.
10872 We were advised (in advance) that burgers would be pink inside, which we prefer.
10873 If you want yours well done, ask.
10874 You order at counter, and the food is brought to your booth.
10875 This was our second visit, and we would return.
10876 Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace, so expect to spend some time looking for a spot.
10877 The service at this location is absolutely atrocious.
10878 I went to the Starbucks to get a Frappuccino, as I've done many times at this location without issue.
10879 The employee working the counter had an absolutely revolting tattoo near her collar bone and a scowl on her face.
10880 She asked me if I had a membership AFTER I had swiped my card, then said "Too late," when I told her I had one.
10881 Then, the idiot with the spiky blonde hair made me a Frappuccino that was basically brown water.
10882 I told her to make it again.
10883 She made it again, then informed me that she put extra shots of chocolate in it, and I should ask for extra chocolate if I don't want it to taste like water.
10884 I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day, but apparently the problem lies with me.
10885 I'm not the one who chose a career in customer service.
10886 If the coffee slingers at this branch can't pretend to enjoy their jobs, they should be put out on the street.
10887 This is the best restaurant in Phoenix.
10888 My wife and I have been eating out here for years, Their servers are great and the food is always delicious.
10889 The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique.
10890 Check out their website at http://www.phoenixcitygrille.com
10891 I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did.
10892 We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.
10893 Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels.
10894 The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery "rub," the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner.
10895 The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish.
10896 At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!).
10897 This was a happy medium for me.
10898 The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.
10899 My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.
10900 My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky.
10901 Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect.
10902 The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine.
10903 The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable.
10904 We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat.
10905 I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I can't wait to go back!
10906 My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldn't talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends.
10907 I would bet that the place doesn't have a DJ all the time, though.
10908 Treachery!
10909 Seek it out:
10910 Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F.
10911 Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.
10912 P.F.
10913 Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food.
10914 They bill themselves as a "gourmet" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart.
10915 Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced.
10916 Once you've paid nearly $14 for their "orange peel chicken", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice.
10917 This is your second mistake.
10918 Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit.
10919 You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.
10920 Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.
10921 Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F.
10922 Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation.
10923 It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang.
10924 (They literally cut out the poor bastard's "i" so that it would "fit on the signs better," or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.)
10925 It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great "American Chinese" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of "wok charred beef", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.
10926 The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death.
10927 From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:
10928 'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming.
10929 "Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant," Jim told me, pointing at the statues.
10930 "It's not lucky.
10931 It's something you put at a burial site!
10932 But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."
10933 From a Chinese perspective, P.F.
10934 Changs is decorated with death.'
10935 Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.
10936 As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew.
10937 We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food.
10938 Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter.
10939 (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.)
10940 The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse.
10941 The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers.
10942 Very opulent without being ostentatious!.
10943 We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut.
10944 Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving.
10945 My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving.
10946 We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered.
10947 (I'll go back during baseball season :-) )
10948 After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree.
10949 The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces.
10950 The house rub was described as "cajun-style, but not overwhelming".
10951 My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce.
10952 The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side.
10953 (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table.
10954 We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert.
10955 Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.
10956 One comment: The "Branding" of the restaurant is confusing.
10957 Either call it "Dominick's" or "Lincoln Avenue", but not both.
10958 This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate.
10959 (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.)
10960  I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!
10961 Great theatre!
10962 Super clean and nice sound in all theatres.
10963 Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing, so when I order a medium, I want a medium, I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large.
10964 I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick.
10965 But thanks anyway.
10966 Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very clean,sterile and safe.
10967 Be Back soon need some work done
10968 I am a huge fan of this place.
10969 I haven't ventured outside of the teppen tables, so my viewpoint may be limited.
10970 The atmosphere is quite loud and lively, but definitely fun.
10971 It is great for a nice dinner with a group.
10972 The food is simply outstanding.
10973 The soup, salad, and chicken are all excellent, but the fried rice is the absolute best.
10974 I have never had better fried rice anywhere.
10975 After you have enjoyed the main course, get the green tea ice cream.
10976 I hate green tea, but for some reason, this ice cream is amazing.
10977 If you like teppen yaki and don't want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana, definitely give this place a shot.
10978 You won't be disappointed.
10979 I got to stay here for work and had the best time!
10980 They have so many pools.
10981 I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself.
10982 It was great!
10983 They let me send free postcards which was fun, too.
10984 My room was beautiful.
10985 It was large and had great amenities.
10986 Food was disgusting though.
10987 I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week.
10988 Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!
10989 I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate.
10990 We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it.
10991 The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here.
10992 The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.
10993 I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge.
10994 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders.
10995 The sliders were awesome.
10996 The meat was tender and really juicy.
10997 The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh.
10998 The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar.
10999 The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.
11000 There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider.
11001 Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting.
11002 Reason number three is that the cheese is melted.
11003 REALLY melted.
11004 I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.
11005 Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.
11006 The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe.
11007 Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going...
11008 Great iced tea.
11009 Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes.
11010 Love the biscuits.
11011 You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel.
11012 Wow!
11013 This place completely rocks!
11014 Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.
11015 The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!
11016 Thank you, Stewart Detailing!
11017 Job well done.
11018 I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order.
11019 I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.
11020 At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.
11021 I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.
11022 She just smiled and said "Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu."
11023 I said, "but it's on the internet with your address/web page"  and she said, "yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu"  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.
11024 I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.
11025 The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.
11026 The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces "out-of-the-freezer-bag" deep fried.
11027  I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.
11028 I also don't like false advertising.
11029 A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.
11030 They can learn a lot from their customers.
11031 Awesome awesome awesome!!!
11032 Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!!
11033 The flavors pop in your mouth!!
11034 Very creative chef.
11035 I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in.
11036 By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses.
11037 Each one full of flavor making you want more.
11038 The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering.
11039 I would definitely go again.
11040 Pricey but so worth it!
11041 !
11042 If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options.
11043 Needless to say, when I'm in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo.
11044 From the moment you're in, to the moment you're out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds.
11045 The chips are salsa aren't filler but a real treat.
11046 Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.
11047 I believe they have three different kinds.
11048 Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.
11049 (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.)
11050 The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare.
11051 Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are.
11052 The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.
11053 An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal.
11054 _C$
11055 It is a 110 mile round trip for me, passing who knows how many salons along the way, and it is well worth the drive even during rush hour.
11056 Ask for Ray if you want an amazing hair experience.
11057 You will go home feeling beautiful/handsome.
11058 I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.
11059 My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.
11060 Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.
11061 Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.
11062 That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama.
11063 The decor was comfortable and breezy.
11064 Everything else  - not so much.
11065 1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?
11066 Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?
11067 The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.
11068 It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.
11069 The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.
11070 So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.
11071 I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.
11072 As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.
11073 Very nice.
11074 He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.
11075 Sounds good, right?
11076 Vile, absolutely vile.
11077 Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.
11078 On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.
11079 My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.
11080 He was very sweet and well-intentioned.
11081 However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.
11082 Don't say "are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"
11083 or "are we ready for dessert?"
11084 Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, "we" aren't doing anything together.
11085 Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.
11086 oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?
11087 $52.
11088 for lunch.
11089 Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all.
11090 Steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top.
11091 He is in my neighborhood, so it is great for me - convenient.
11092 Steve is personable and the shop is inviting.
11093 I love the hot towel and back-vibrator massage.
11094 I have been going to Steve for years, great service product!
11095 I love the Ranch Market!
11096 The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent!
11097 I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.
11098 Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.
11099 After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.
11100 I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.
11101 Yummy!
11102 After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.
11103 Since the Gilbert location has closed.
11104 The Tempe location has had more things to offer.
11105 The staff has really stepped it up on customer service.
11106 They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
11107 Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever!
11108 but it was just perfect in ever way!!
11109 !
11110 They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food....
11111 its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :)
11112 my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!!
11113 :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!
11114 !
11115 i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing)
11116 WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!!
11117 and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef!
11118 over all it was very rich... but great to share....
11119 My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine
11120 we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves....
11121 all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place...
11122 i cannot wait to come back!
11123 Of the 3 sites - this is the Kindergarten.
11124 My daughter is attending here and I simply love it.
11125 She's five and is repeating kindergarten.
11126 She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes.
11127 We are having her repeat because she's a little young for first grade, but this isn't an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.
11128 In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.
11129 this year they will build upon all of that and take her further.
11130 The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.
11131 And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home.
11132 It's pricey.
11133 But so very worth it.
11134 LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
11135 Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for.
11136 Comfort food for sure.
11137 Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu.
11138 Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must!
11139 This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else.
11140 Absolutely sensational food.
11141 We had the evening buffett.
11142 I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.
11143 Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
11144 I eat here frequently as I stay at the adjoining Hilton when I'm in town, and the breakfast vouchers are generous.
11145 The steak and eggs ($15) features a good cut of meat (I think it's a flank steak), 2 eggs anyway you want them, with corn salsa and toast and potatoes.
11146 The servers are always amenable to allowing me to change out the sides for lots of fruit.
11147 I love the mustard available at the table, the fact that they have Chilulah hot sauce on hand, and will bring out some salsa at no extra cost.
11148 The staff are pretty attentive.
11149 I call ahead to avoid having to wait in the breakfast rush.
11150 I have also had an omelet which was substantial in size and quite tasty, with unlimited ingredients for about $12.
11151 My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign " Best Sandwich...." Um, no.
11152 If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak.
11153 First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy.
11154 Second, put some meat on there.
11155 It was 50% bun.
11156 It should be toasted and crunchy.
11157 And price, a 12" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me.
11158 For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had.
11159 Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market.
11160 I'm a big fan of Silver Mine.
11161 I have been for a long time.
11162 In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place.
11163 Ever.
11164 I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me.
11165 I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop.
11166 The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good.
11167 Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich.
11168 I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes!
11169 P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)
11170 Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems.
11171 I haven't seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings we've found a bug almost every single day and not just 'bugs' but cockroaches.
11172 I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didn't do anything wrong.
11173 I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone.
11174 Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today.
11175 Andrea is absolutely wonderful.
11176 She's pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and I've never had a single issue.
11177 On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me.
11178 Now I just call her to let her know the days I'll be away and she arrives without any problems.
11179 She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution.
11180 She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.
11181 On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals.
11182 I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter.
11183 She can't be beat.
11184 If you are a tea drinker, you have to stop by!
11185 The variety seems endless as you read over the menu so it really comes down to which tea fits your particular mood at that moment (mine right now is the "cookie monster" which is awesome!)
11186 For the past three months I've been receiving unsolicited spam text messages from these clowns, so regardless of how nice a place this might be, I'll never stay with them or any other affiliated property for that reason alone.
11187 I've complained to the hotel (I was blown off), blocked them from my cell phone account, and filed a complaint with the feds.
11188 So...since the hotel continues to find it appropriate to light up my cell phone at 3 am with spam texts, I hereby award them a generous one-star rating.
11189 I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap!
11190 Oh it's truly a must try place.
11191 The waiter got the drink wrong: "up" means served strained without ice, not on the rocks, but I was happy about the mistake, The Salmon melted in my mouth and the bread pudding made me fat for hours, but was so worth it.
11192 Great atmosphere and none of our plates were empty when taken away.
11193 I would definitely go back.
11194 Good service, great food, fun atmosphere.
11195 Great flexible hours on a Sunday.
11196 GO !
11197 We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time, a choice between two types - we picked the Osetra.
11198 Caviar is served with mini toasts,  minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it.
11199 What a treat.
11200 As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet.
11201 Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!
11202 !
11203 Lolo's is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.
11204 Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything.
11205 Things I've tried there:
11206 LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.
11207 Their chicken is perfectly cooked.
11208 Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.
11209 Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.
11210 It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.
11211 I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.
11212 That's what makes it so darn delicious.
11213 It's definitely a meal in itself.
11214 Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.
11215 Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!
11216 !
11217 Their koolaide are awesome as well.
11218 You can't come here and not have their koolaide.
11219 I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.
11220 My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.
11221 My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.
11222 Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.
11223 Overall, this place is pretty awesome.
11224 I can't wait for them to finish their expansion.
11225 That's Amore is awesome!
11226 I'm glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized.
11227 It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor.
11228 It's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot.
11229 When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.
11230 I've just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review.
11231 Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.
11232 Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.
11233 I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.
11234 She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.
11235 When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  "Separate checks?"
11236 Terrific.
11237 That was exactly what we needed.
11238 I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie "comfort" variety.
11239 It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.
11240 Overall, it was a very nice experience.
11241 Great food and service.
11242 It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey, but it is worth it.
11243 They made us feel special.
11244 Friendly group.
11245 Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast.
11246 It's more than enough.
11247 I'm very happy that I called Enterprise Pools.
11248 They have friendly service and worked with my schedule when I asked for an estimate.
11249 Mike was knowledgeable and quickly determined what the problem was and even told me how I could fix it.
11250 He offered service at a reasonable price and never tried to sell me something for the sake of sales.
11251 It was definitely a relief to find an honest business man after dealing with sub par service from Leslie's for such a long time!
11252 I really wanted to like this place.
11253 For starters, I paid cash for my take out.
11254 I was owed back five dollars and was told " we don't have enough change".
11255 So I had to settle for $2.50.
11256 What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?
11257 Especially on a Saturday night.
11258      The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste.
11259 Gave up on them after a few bites.
11260 Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful.
11261 This one was very liquidy and flavorless.
11262 Dumplings were edible at best.
11263      Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili.
11264 I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!!
11265 The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing!
11266 The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible.
11267 I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!
11268 !
11269 Unfortunately Out of Business.
11270 This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing men's items, and I would not recommend them at all.
11271 I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to $600, and they priced it for $90, giving me a whopping take-home of $40.
11272 I understand the need to move merchandise quickly (and naturally, this sold in a matter of days), but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item.
11273 I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price.
11274 Consigner beware!
11275 Tried a little if everything.
11276 The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.
11277 The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.
11278 The strawberry cupcake was perfection.
11279 Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.
11280 Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)
11281 This place makes me want to learn German every time i go.
11282 I would get my Polka clothes out any day of the week.
11283 Great food, great prices, great atmosphere.
11284 The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler.
11285 LOVE IT!
11286 I love this place!!!
11287 OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch.
11288 AMAZING outside grill, everything is good.
11289 Best cheeseburger I've ever had.
11290 I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good.
11291 Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!!
11292 And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from.
11293 Also, they have a great breakfast.
11294 Omelet station and all.
11295 I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos.
11296 GREAT outside patio
11297 Currently having a liquidation sale, but it's not really worth the trip.
11298 I found that most books were cheaper at Amazon then the sale price.
11299 A few were even cheaper at Barnes and Noble then the liquidation sale price!
11300 Which just made me say to myself well that's probably why you're going out of business try some competitive pricing!
11301 The place is an absolute disaster they've moved a lot so the sales staff doesn't even know where everything is.
11302 Also the place just smells dirty and old, it's very unwelcoming.
11303 It's really no surprise to me they couldn't get customers before.
11304 Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.
11305 The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.
11306 Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.
11307 It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.
11308 A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!
11309 Love this place.
11310 Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.
11311 The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!
11312 But I gave it 5 stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.
11313 I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.
11314 Absolutely incredible.
11315 It appears the young lad who works here seems to be the go-to front-desk man everyday for this shop.
11316 He was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and didn't suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really weren't in need of!
11317 I brought in two pairs of dress shoes; one of which I had the heels replaced ($22, free shining included) and another just for shining ($8) and they made them look near-brand new again!
11318 I will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairs/cleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop!
11319 Keep singing,
11320 -Jerron
11321 I'm a regular at Lux.
11322 Haven't reviewed it out of sheer laziness.
11323 And it's usually laziness that brings me here: when I have a major thingie to get done by Day B but I spent all of Day A at the office surfing the Internet instead of working on it, I pay the price with an all-nighter, which I like to start at Lux.
11324 (Damn them for not being open past 10).
11325 This is usually the story when anyone spots me here.
11326 I'll grab a small table for myself, plug in my laptop (free wifi), spread out my papers everywhere, then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious Velvet Latte.
11327 When it's done right, there's a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramel-colored coffee.
11328 Mmm.
11329 Since I am ADD I take frequent breaks of course.
11330 Like every 3 minutes.
11331 Whenever I hear a strange piece of music I really like that I've never heard before (this happens often), I strain to catch part of the lyrics, stick it into Google, find the name of the band, stick it into iTunes and download it.
11332 I'm not making that up.
11333 Like half my music collection was created through this method.
11334 The last few bands I downloaded tracks from are... let me open up my iTunes... Kasabian, Feist, and the Detroit Cobras.
11335 I'm not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own.
11336 I give this place NO stars.
11337 They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY!
11338 The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker.
11339 The food SUCKS!
11340 don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long.
11341 I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty.
11342 This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!!!!
11343 I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago!
11344 They have a great happy hour.
11345 There are not many places that you can get a $5 cosmo, appletini, and lemon drop martinis...not many!!
11346 They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same!
11347 They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as well...of course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for...
11348 Anyways...their menu...
11349 The potstickers are just something different that you would not expect...and they are delicious!
11350 I love the crab cake too!
11351 A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings!!
11352 OMG!!
11353 I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too!!
11354 I could just have the appetizers for dinner!
11355 I do often!
11356 Also, I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and more...the dressing just tops it all off...
11357 Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigrette...It is FABULOUS!!
11358 Of course...if you love lobster tail this is the place to get it!
11359 You get two of them!
11360 Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap, but they are so worth it!
11361 The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes, truffled mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach!
11362 They are fantastic!
11363 I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast.
11364 The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point.
11365 This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale.
11366 I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.
11367 I had several mothers tell me about Eduprize and how great it was.
11368 I was a little nervous when I was told there is a waiting list and you have to agree to put time in the classroom.
11369 Now that I am in the classroom volunteering, I realize why it is so great.
11370 I can see first hand why my daughter struggles in some areas and does great in others.
11371 I can see how the others are struggling too and I can be apart of helping them, even if it is just for a day.
11372 This school's requirement to have parents volunteer is something ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD DO!
11373 I'm married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company.
11374 I've been to Japan I don't know how many times and have eaten well there.
11375 This is simply top class, I'd even say special.
11376 The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections.
11377 I'm not in Phoenix often.
11378 But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it.
11379 I love their menu!
11380 The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!
11381 Steak-melts in  your mouth!
11382 Service - great!
11383 Big fan of Applebee's!
11384 Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place.
11385 Very tasty.
11386 All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches.
11387 I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad.
11388 Real good besides that.
11389 I am proud to say that I sent Kristin S. here for her awesome hair transformation (8 inches is a lot, girl!)
11390 I just had my second hair cut here today, and I was just as happy this time as I was the first time around.
11391 First of all, the service is top notch - they take care of you quickly, kindly and enthusiastically.
11392 They are not snobby, which is a welcome relief when living in Scottsdale.
11393 I have always felt welcome and comfortable here.
11394 Moreover, the prices are amazing!
11395 I have very easy and basic hair, and they charge me $45 for a hair cut - if you want to spend more, you certainly can, but I am fine with the "stylist" level (who charges $45).
11396 In Tampa I paid more like $65, but I much prefer Par Exsalonce.
11397 This place is a well oiled machine, and they know how to run a salon.
11398 They carry B&B products, which are fun every once in a while.
11399 I really love this place and will not look for another hair place in the Valley.
11400 This place knows how to treat customers, style hair and create a pleasant experience.
11401 The Market Street location is a bonus, too, because you can even do some damage shopping when you bounce out with your new 'do.
11402 How could you not love this place?
11403 Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable "grocery" shop next door.
11404 It's a great place to people watch!
11405 (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)
11406 After moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.
11407 This is the one place that I LOVE!
11408 I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.
11409 It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.
11410 There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!
11411 The only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.
11412 I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.
11413 I had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.
11414 Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.
11415 Although, they look quite good!
11416 I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.
11417 The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!
11418 I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.
11419 I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza, pastas and desserts AZ has to offer.
11420 If you wanna take my word for it, dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order:
11421 Appetizer: Calimari
11422 Dinner: Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken
11423 Dessert: White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut Pazookie
11424 FYI: Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip, make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations.
11425 Best chocolate ever!
11426 I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.
11427 I'm so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.
11428 Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!
11429 I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices.
11430 The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored...
11431 We have been here several times and each time has been excellent.
11432 Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix.
11433         Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentine's day dinner here.
11434 Dinner was great.
11435 Food was timed right and our server was on top of it.
11436 Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us.
11437 Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks, so yes its pricey, but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it.
11438 Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at.
11439 Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix, they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious.
11440 I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in.
11441 Man, I miss their food.
11442 Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar!
11443 Be warned though.
11444 Their food is BIG.
11445 Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful.
11446 No matter whether I've been to Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.
11447 A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night.
11448 No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo.
11449 Fogo back east is really "date night" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers.
11450 Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels.
11451 IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so.
11452 If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up.
11453 In any regard, it did not bother me in the least.
11454 I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks.
11455 You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.
11456 The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good.
11457 Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar.
11458 Did you see what I just did there?
11459 Nice wine selections here.
11460 Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin.
11461 Let me first say if I could have given 0 stars I would have.
11462 My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed.
11463 We had gone to a different Pancho's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that.
11464 The choices were very very limited and basic.
11465 There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamale,taco and some horrible tasting enchiladas.
11466 How does a Mexican food place not offer burritos...have you guys heard of a bean burrito?
11467 Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer.
11468 The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas, which actually were good.
11469 Unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay $20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas.
11470 Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place.
11471 Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost.
11472 Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer.
11473 They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to.
11474 Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food.
11475 The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does.
11476 QT frickin' rocks.
11477 And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.
11478 North Glendale's cool new  hangout.
11479 Formerly Cactus Willy's.
11480 Completely remodelled!
11481 Follow us on facebook at Justin Willys!
11482 Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.
11483 We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.
11484 Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.
11485 It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.
11486 I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.
11487 Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR!
11488 We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.
11489 We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.
11490 The best breakfast place, bar none!
11491 I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!
11492 The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!
11493 My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.
11494 We always leave stuffed!!
11495 Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!
11496 !
11497 My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night!
11498 We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight!
11499 We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town!
11500 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?!
11501 My favorite was the steamed mussels.
11502 We loved it so much we also had dinner.
11503 The classic pasta deal was the best.
11504 Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day.
11505 It's hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right!
11506 We will defiantly be back for more!
11507 My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date, and had such a lovely time.
11508 I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo.
11509 They firefly room is utterly transporting as well.
11510 Frankly, I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful, but we will go again soon.
11511 I strongly recommend a strolling date here.
11512 Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free.
11513 Oh and here's a tip-if you cant find a space, park across the street at the Viad Tower.
11514 Its free if you exit from the north side.
11515 This is a great dog park.
11516 Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to play with.
11517 And drinking fountains and places to sit.
11518 The majority of the dogs are nice, but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior.
11519 I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day.
11520 The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap, and I can do chores in peace.
11521 I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.
11522 He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost.
11523 I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well.
11524 I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop.
11525 Plus you support local business and not a chain.
11526 My experience here was awesome from start to finish.
11527 I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to "please, sit down, be at home".
11528 Awesome.
11529 I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don't), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don't serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.
11530 Huge bonus.
11531 I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.
11532 I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.
11533 Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.
11534 Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.
11535 I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.
11536 Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.
11537 A+!
11538 I am disgruntled by the reviews I have read about Sapporo.
11539 I have a few things to say.
11540 1.
11541 I am tired of people complaining about the prices at Sapporo.
11542 When you compare price vs. quality you will always be in a favorable position.
11543 If you cannot afford Sapporo perhaps you shouldn't eat there.
11544 I am not trying to sound arrogant, but you truly get what you pay for.
11545 Sapporo consistently prepares the best  sushi I have had in Arizona.
11546 2.
11547 I understand wait time may be an issue.
11548 I suggest that you arrive early and anticipate a wait.
11549 Honestly, is thirty minutes on a Friday night going to bother you?
11550 The food is well worth the wait.
11551 3.
11552 Please stop wearing flip-flops and bathing suits.
11553 Perhaps this is the reason you are experiencing "rude" service.
11554 A pair of jeans and a polo is fine.
11555 Sapporo is a Phenomenal restaurant.
11556 In my opinion, Sapporo serves the best Sushi in Arizona.
11557 Falafel is outstanding here, dark exterior with green interior, and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying.
11558 Cooked just right too for texture.
11559 Fries are a nice side.
11560 Prices reasonable here, plenty of parking, and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge.
11561 Note that there's just a few seats inside, since this is also a grocery place.
11562 To-go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination.
11563 When I'm casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christopher's.
11564 We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!
11565 Let me repeat that - best in town!!
11566 !
11567 Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person.
11568 Can't beat it!
11569 Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chef's tatts!?
11570 If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven, don't sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!
11571 I love this store!
11572 They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!
11573 I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!
11574 Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!
11575 This is our neighborhood restaurant.
11576 Whenever I want Margarita Sunrise and desserts, I went to Switch.
11577 I never disappoint.
11578 The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent.
11579 The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered.
11580 Admission was free for me.
11581 How you may ask?
11582 Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go.
11583 The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world.
11584  All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested.
11585 There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore.
11586 There were even some animated pieces.
11587 I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through.
11588 The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled.
11589 You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet.
11590 It is mind blowing.
11591 The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully.
11592  They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself.
11593 There is also a children's section to the museum.
11594 I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself.
11595 I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go.
11596 It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself.
11597 The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix.
11598 It will really open up your eyes and make you think.
11599 As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind ..
11600 And then i sampled Goodytwo's toffee ..wowzer !
11601 Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good !
11602 They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate .
11603 Listen ,you can't put a price on happiness ,ha ha
11604 Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwo's.
11605 Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwo's has perfected this,worth every penny !
11606 Rock on ladies !
11607 Doesn't get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!
11608 Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's.
11609 And the hot fudge sundae for dessert?
11610 Dang, just can't beat it.
11611 The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy.
11612 The best.
11613 Got to love the concept, coffee, art and a co-work space friendly for start-ups.
11614 OSP has that feel of old college dorm meets painters loft.
11615 The coffee is good, the WiFi is fast and the staff is friendly and they don't harass you, I couldn't ask for more to get work done!
11616 I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 25 cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.)
11617 Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great.
11618 It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do!
11619 The Sunday brunch is great.
11620 All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily.
11621 I don't blame them.
11622 One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing.
11623 It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype.
11624 I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away.
11625 I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach.
11626 The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy.
11627 My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal.
11628 It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.
11629 The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee.
11630 They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different.
11631 We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help.
11632 After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.
11633 Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing.
11634 As a regular shopper of Last Chance, I must equally love The Rack.
11635 I am a cheap shopper, so Last Chance has the lower prices, but like I have said before, the product can be a bit beaten up.
11636 At The Rack it is a much more relaxed environment, way more organized, and the staff is so much more help full.
11637 I usually like to shop for shirts, dresses and jackets here.
11638 They also have a great selection of shoes, underwear, and pants, all a bit out of my price range though.
11639 Last week I found the greatest find!
11640 I found the best pea coat ever!
11641 It is black with double buttons and a belt, not too long and it has pockets in the perfect place.
11642 The best part, it was originally $160, their price was $59.95 AND all their wool coats we 25% off.
11643 Score!
11644 Now I will be warm in this Arizona winter.
11645 Haha
11646 Check them out.
11647 The parking lot can be crazy this time of year, but what parking lot isn't.
11648 There is a rumor that Santa is stationed right outside the store as well.
11649 :-)
11650 I've been here 3 times.
11651 The first was fair, so I gave it another shot, second time fair again, third time (kyoto was closed soooo....) let me start by saying, I've been in the service industry for awhile.
11652 I know the difference between good and bad service.
11653 If they had been busy this would be one thing, but there was us and a few people at the bar.
11654 NEVER HAVE I WANTED TO THROW MY BURGER AT SOMEONE AS MUCH AS OUR SERVER.
11655 The server was an idiot and the food was ALL burnt... medium burgers are not CHARRED on the outside and RAW on the inside.
11656 Steamed veggies are not CHARBROILED asparagus... everything was so horrible.
11657 We didn't complain, but we did ask about the charcoal that was our veggies....
11658 Which we were given a crappy attitude in response.
11659 We weren't even looking for it to be taken off our bill, just a recognition that the food was TOTALLY burned and half our orders were wrong.
11660 BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything...  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY / CONSISTENCY will get you through.
11661 if you don't know what a good meal is and you want to think you're cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA, you should try it.
11662 There are better places to spend hard earned money.
11663 I thought this place was outstanding!
11664 The staff was awesome, the food was excellent, overall appearance of restaurant was nice!
11665 We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner.
11666 Love their green chiles!!
11667 !
11668 Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening.
11669 Can someone please tell me why people go here??
11670 ?
11671 Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies.
11672 The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.
11673 That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service.
11674 We sat down and waited.
11675 And waited.
11676 Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order.
11677 Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by.
11678 She seems mystified that there was a job to do.
11679 With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes.
11680 Yes.
11681 15 freaking minutes.
11682 Food?
11683 Mediocre at best.
11684 I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries.
11685 The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it.
11686 The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted.
11687 The eggs were *ok* but nothing great.
11688 The home fries?
11689 My 9-year old niece could do a better job.
11690 My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.
11691 I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now.
11692 My food coma isn't satisfying.
11693 I will *never* go here again.
11694 Ever.
11695 I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.
11696 Total.
11697 Fail.
11698 Blech.
11699 Holy crap is this place good.
11700 With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know.
11701 Next time though.
11702 The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from.
11703 I had onions and pickles......
11704 I know, another let down.
11705 Next time I sware.
11706 Also the onion rings are tops here.
11707 Fries looked good too.
11708 The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff.
11709 Outdoor seating is nice when it's not hot out and it's very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one.
11710 Saw Batman.
11711 I love this place.
11712 Food is ALWAYS fresh, cook correct and service is great.
11713 Not to mention their lunch specials!!!
11714 My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME!!!
11715 !
11716 I've eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.
11717   First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space.
11718 This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.
11719    That said, I really like this one.
11720 The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen.
11721 That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.
11722    The food, though...the food is spectacular.
11723 Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures.
11724 The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty.
11725 Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better.
11726 I also snagged the bananoffee pie.
11727 It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing.
11728 It was just that good.
11729 Not too sweet, very banana-y...
11730    Eat here.
11731 It's really that simple.
11732    Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front.
11733 And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy.
11734 Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it.
11735 Great Italian food with portions designed to share.
11736 And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).
11737 We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.
11738 After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.
11739 I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!
11740 Sometimes things happen, and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of.
11741 The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best, and nicest Doctors you'll find in the state.
11742 i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.
11743 the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.
11744 i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).
11745 it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.
11746 everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones).
11747 highly, highly recommended.
11748 Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers.
11749 They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them.
11750 Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult.
11751 I shall return to get my dogs groomed here.
11752 Would recommend.
11753 If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection.
11754 They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens.
11755 I'm a big fan!
11756 I was looking for a place close to where I live for eyebrow waxing and I was referred by About Face Salon here.
11757 (According to AZSpaGirls, About Face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service....)  They were great about squeezing me in the day I called.
11758 Angela was fantastic, she worked very quickly and with a very light hand.
11759 She is so good with the wax that she doesn't need to tweeze at all, which for me is always the worst part.
11760 (Granted I don't have very um, complicated, eyebrows).
11761 She was very sweet and for $15 I will be returning to her.
11762 Now open on Saturdays!!!!
11763 Yes!!!!
11764 !
11765 I've been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience.
11766 You can order their stuff online as well and it's free shipping after a certain amount, but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy, and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that.
11767 Once I find a product I'm loyal to, then I do the online thing.
11768 This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesn't clog your pores.
11769 It seems like an initially pricey investment when you're first getting started, but mineral make-up keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want.
11770 When I say a certain food contains ingredients such as blue cheese and bacon, what comes to mind?
11771 No, I'm not talking about a salad, I'm talking about an ice cream sundae!
11772 Sweet Republic is an awesome little ice cream parlor located in a strip mall in Scottsdale, Arizona.
11773 This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house.
11774 Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors.
11775 These are just a few examples of what we sampled:
11776 Basil Lime Sorbet
11777 Salted Butter Caramel
11778 Apple Pie
11779 Dessert Honey
11780 Maple Pecan
11781 Almond Buttercrunch
11782 Cashew Turtle
11783 All of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered, and that was their Honey Blue Cheese.
11784 That's right, Blue Cheese ice cream.
11785 When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked.
11786 It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it.
11787 I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal.
11788 It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time.
11789 Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae.
11790 They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle.
11791 When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch.
11792 This sundae was exploding with flavor.
11793 Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious.
11794 My fiancé had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream, Almond Buttercrunch ice cream, salted caramel sauce, brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow.
11795 Hers was also amazing.
11796 The service and prices here were both great.
11797 The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us.
11798 The prices here are similar to  Coldstone's.
11799 I'm absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream.
11800 I shouldn't be telling you all this, for fear that you all would think I'm a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go.
11801 It was so yummy!
11802 Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate.
11803 Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs.
11804 Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.
11805 Special.
11806 Not on menu.
11807 Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette.
11808 This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life.
11809 Good food at a good price.
11810 I went with my sister 2 days ago.
11811 It was my first time eating Famous Dave's.
11812 I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese.
11813 They were both okay, I tasted better.
11814 Now the hot wings & onion rings were better.
11815 the place was packed we sat outside.
11816 Water park is OK.
11817 However, the parking lot has ZERO security.
11818 No security patrols, no cameras.
11819 My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.
11820 Sawed right off in broad daylight.
11821 According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.
11822 BEWARE!
11823 The water park management doesn't give a shit.
11824 Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  "Our camera is broken but it's getting fixed next week".
11825 What a joke.
11826 If you go, have someone drop you off.
11827 You've been warned!
11828 So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.
11829 It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.
11830 Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.
11831 I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.
11832 yummy!
11833 Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.
11834 There is usually no wait.
11835 The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.
11836 A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.
11837 Eat hummus and pita.
11838 Try falafel.
11839 Try anything on the menu, because it is all good.
11840 I absolutely love their personal hotpot room!
11841 I tried it for the first time Sunday...and went back Monday again!
11842 Their item portion is big and fresh!
11843 Only downside is that there isn't any sauce that is pre-made...
11844 Other than that, this place is AMAZING
11845 I've gone back a few times since my last review.
11846 Every single experience has been fantastic!
11847 The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!!
11848 Sooooo freaken amazing!
11849 Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect!
11850 And the fried cheese curd...just get it!
11851 I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!
11852 Absolutely awful... these guys have NO idea what they are doing!
11853 Great pecan apple pancakes!
11854 Superb decaf coffee.
11855 Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.
11856 Restaurant was clean.
11857 I have already recommended it to another foodie.
11858 IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park.
11859 I LOVE LOVE me some Joe's real bbq!!
11860 They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing!
11861 There's little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and it's sooo good.
11862 Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn.
11863 Pretty much everything is great here.
11864 The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006.
11865 My fiance took me here because he knows I'm a bbq fanatic, and I swear I though to myself, "What is this place?
11866 A cafeteria?".
11867 I did not expect the food to be any good at all.
11868 Well, was I took quick to judge!
11869 Taught me never to judge a book by it's covers again!
11870 Even though you get in line, pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS, the food is the best.
11871 They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights.
11872 It makes you feel like you're at a nice park having a nice bbq.
11873 Joe's is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley.
11874 Nothing tops this.
11875 Anything you order is amazing.
11876 Oh, and try their chocolate chip cookie.
11877 Soft and melty and so so good!
11878 Do not go to this car wash.
11879 I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no!
11880 They locked my keys in the car.
11881 I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal.
11882 Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window.
11883 Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys.
11884 I was trapped there over an hour!
11885 The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence.
11886 They didn't even comp the car wash!
11887 If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!
11888 What an awesome sushi place!
11889 I highly recommend How do You roll, if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait.
11890 what a novel idea.
11891 I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me, can't wait to come back again!
11892 Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.
11893 If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.
11894 The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!
11895 I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.
11896 This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.
11897 Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.
11898 i called them and they wanted to charge $30 for fingerprints!!!!!
11899 What a joke.
11900 I found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for $10.
11901 Caveat Emptor!
11902 If if could give them a zero rating, I would have.
11903 On the other side of the airpark off of Greenway-Hayden loop is Global Pi Security.
11904 $10 for prints.
11905 Their address is 7807 East Greenway road, suite 9, Scottsdale, Az.
11906 globalpi-security (dot) com.
11907 Good luck.
11908 So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour.
11909 Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like.
11910 I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered.
11911 It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla.
11912 It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared.
11913 In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta.
11914 I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it.
11915 The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven.
11916 The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig.
11917 Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue.
11918 Just called at 9:45 to ask when they were open until.
11919 Woman said they were already closed but website says open until 10 pm.
11920 Really??
11921 Obviously don't care about patronage...mexican is a dime a dozen in the new NEW Mexico...no thanks.
11922 Next!
11923 I've been a fan of La Bocca for a long time because it served the needs of an underserved demographic on Mill Avenue.
11924 Canteen offers many things that La Bocca does...and more.
11925 What is that demographic exactly?
11926 ...Late twenties, looking for something chic and classy without paying a ridiculous premium for those qualities.
11927 Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults, but for those of us who lie somewhere in between, places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right.
11928 Canteen one ups La Bocca, in fact, because there are menu items included in happy hour (50% off most drinks and select food items).
11929 Here are the highlights:
11930 The margarita.
11931 It's a real margarita!
11932 (It's not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita.
11933 Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make.)
11934 The chips and salsa.
11935 Both fresh and delicious.
11936 The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious.
11937  The ribs.
11938 Sweet and spicy...the level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones.
11939 The ambiance.
11940 It's chic but not pretentious.
11941 My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music.
11942 Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff (it verges on Scottsdale).
11943 To contextualize some of the other yelper's comments.
11944 I was glad to hear that one yelper didn't find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs.
11945 There's a bar (or ten) down the street for that.
11946 For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small, I suspect they didn't understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for (in fact, the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations).
11947 Finally, the service complains...my service has been cordial and attentive, even when super-busy.
11948 Folks, this place is new, let's let it go through it's growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place.
11949 Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasn't excellent!
11950 A quick note, there isn't a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesn't stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!
11951 Loooove this place!
11952 Yes it's pricey, but good sushi usually is.
11953 The guys making the rolls were friendly.
11954 The atmosphere is nice.
11955 Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll.
11956 Seriously, try it.
11957 You won't be disappointed!
11958 No rake, no annual membership or fees.
11959 Just a fun "home" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.
11960 They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500.
11961 Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.
11962 Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously.
11963 Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.
11964 Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.
11965 They don't do extra work that doesn't need to be done, they are very honest.
11966 The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!
11967 This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.
11968 I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.
11969 After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know I'd have a hard time looking elsewhere.
11970 I don't know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch.
11971 There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.
11972 The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go.
11973 The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!)
11974 is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date.
11975 The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items).
11976 It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items.
11977 One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan.
11978 As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what "vegan" meant.
11979 We ended up having to call a manager over.
11980 The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get.
11981 My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer.
11982 *the BEST* cocktail around IMO.
11983 Do not pass up dessert.
11984 The bananas foster is amazing!
11985 Not traditional but good in and of its own.
11986 We had a great time.
11987 Had bottle service with Katie.
11988 who was super friendly.
11989 Our drinks were never empty, and that was nice because we were celebrating a birthday.
11990 The music and atmosphere were great.
11991 So yummy!
11992 I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didn't even feel guilty.
11993 Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner.
11994 I can't wait to go again!
11995 I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch!
11996 The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious!
11997 Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it.
11998 Everything tasted really fresh!
11999 A perfect lunch spot :)
12000 I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review!
12001 The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you.
12002 The store is huge with very little signs to guide you.
12003 Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me.
12004 Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project.
12005 I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service.
12006 The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said "well you can call them".
12007 I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back.
12008 Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!
12009 !
12010 My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel.
12011 I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.
12012 Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good.
12013 We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go.
12014 As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates.
12015 I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.
12016 I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven.
12017 So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home.
12018 I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste.
12019 Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.
12020 The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted.
12021 Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor.
12022 Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste.
12023 The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate.
12024 Which is offered on the side.
12025 Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread.
12026 As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter.
12027 Superb!
12028 The Mac and cheese was super duper great.
12029 In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner.
12030 I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.
12031 BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!
12032 !
12033 Always good food and good service.
12034 Best gyros around.
12035 I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours.
12036 Excellent food!
12037 Agree the sizzling rice soup is a must try.
12038 I had chicken pad thai 5 of 7 spicy level because I like spicy food.
12039 Great you can request spiciness level on each entree.
12040 I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being "cute-sy."
12041 The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale.
12042 My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently.
12043 We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table.
12044 We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook.
12045 The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese.
12046 It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer.
12047 We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving.
12048 The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too.
12049 This place is just special!
12050 Plan an event, take a guest.
12051 It is a spot that will make it memorable.
12052 This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter.
12053 My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd.
12054 Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day.
12055 Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious!
12056 We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day.
12057 I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy!
12058 It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything more.
12059 Definitely recommend coming here!
12060 We went here for my wife's birthday, and it's a rare 5-star review for me.
12061 They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere.
12062 We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat.
12063 Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed.
12064 They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors.
12065 The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared.
12066 And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough.
12067 They serve it "lazy style" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly.
12068 A special birthday souffle topped the evening off.
12069 Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion.
12070 I agree with the other reviewers..
12071 Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe.
12072 All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind.
12073 There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer.
12074 I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be "New school" or "Traditional"   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating....
12075 I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family.
12076 New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!
12077 The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.
12078 $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.
12079 They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.
12080 The upgrades are ridiculous.
12081 $1.00 here for cheese on an already "well priced" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.
12082 C'mon.
12083 And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!
12084 What a disappointment.
12085 The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.
12086 Take a pass.
12087 My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food.
12088 Great lunch specials.
12089 Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea
12090 HELLLLLLLLO GOLFERS!
12091 What a sexy course this is.
12092 This ranks up there with some of the best courses I've ever played, and THE BEST desert course I have ever played!
12093 Yes it's desert links style golf, but you're in the desert so what do you expect?
12094 It's kind of a trek, but it'll be worth it.
12095 From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you'll enjoy the service and scenery.
12096 A real private club feel.
12097 As mentioned earlier this is DESERT LINKS GOLF!
12098 No adjoining fairways, and all the crap plays as PGA desert (lateral).
12099 The fairways are pretty wide for the most part, so you can spray the ball a bit, but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes.
12100 Hole 18 is a very hard core par 4.
12101 Long carry on the approach to the green with a TON of water along the right side of the fairway and green.
12102 This is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick.
12103 Don't be afraid to lay up.
12104 :)    Oh, and there are mens ratings for ALL the tee boxes, I'd recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees, because this course could be really hard if you're a mediocre golfer...
12105 Maintenance was perfect, even in September after baking in the Arizona heat all summer.
12106 The fairways were well manicured, and not too hard.
12107 Nice rough, but not too tall.
12108 A slightly errant shot will be caught, but you won't have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either.
12109 The greens were also perfect.
12110 Nice and fast, and TRUE!
12111 Ok, I'm done gushing about this course...   Give it a shot, you won't regret it.
12112 very laid back, very clean.
12113 This was my first piercing since I was a little kid.
12114 I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions.
12115 I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online.
12116 My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also.
12117 I felt very safe and comfortable.
12118 We tried this last night for our date night.
12119 We were impressed.
12120 The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions.
12121 This is a great place to relax and talk.
12122 The food was great.
12123 I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.
12124 My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.
12125 He thought it was great...We will be back...
12126 Best breakfast in the valley.
12127 Dinner sucks.
12128 Well, let's clarify a bit here.
12129 We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items.
12130 They were all stupidly good.
12131 For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS!
12132 Stay away from that canned garbage.
12133 Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!
12134 I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking...
12135 Of course, it's always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you're all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on, it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi.
12136 Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue.
12137 For $8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website, the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time... and I've used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it's door-to-door consistent service.
12138 If you are interested in covered parking, call ahead, but otherwise, just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there.
12139 Also, I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car.
12140 I hope you'll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do... safe travels!
12141 I LOVE Kona's happy hour.
12142 Amazing deals on great sushi rolls, and the diner can always count on fast and friendly service.
12143 I am always happy with my experience at Kona, and find myself comparing it to other sushi restaurants.
12144 None can compare to Kona.
12145 Kona is the only place that offers my cherished Skinny Cucumber Mojito, and I come here often for it.
12146 I ask for this drink at other places and am always shocked that most don't even offer a skinny option, let alone the cucumber mojito.
12147 I have dined in the Scottsdale location as well as the Cherry Creek location in Denver, and both have equivalent high marks in service and food quality.
12148 Wanna try it?
12149 Now is your chance!
12150 One more day of this LivingSocial deal: 12 days for $49
12151 http://t.livingsocial.com/deals/453990?ref=email-jp&rpi=85154658
12152 Love love love this place.
12153 Great appetizers and cocktail menu.
12154 Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
12155 I love this place.
12156 I just tried the other Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley, and was disappointed, and my gratitude for Cafe Lalibela multiplied.
12157 The food here is fresh and authentic, and the staff are really nice.
12158 I'm so lucky to live down the street!
12159 Tons of vegan options, too.
12160 I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ, decided to give them another go .....
12161 I was right the first time!
12162 As before, the food was ho-hum at best, the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again, their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service?
12163 We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (That's odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us.
12164 To top it all off, they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food, crummy service and high heat!!
12165 !
12166 For me, this place is officially off the books and we sure won't be back.
12167 Lesson # 1: "Your in the service industry, try and acy like it"
12168 As a BBQ fan, I'll try elsewhere ...............
12169 I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites.
12170 I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience.
12171 Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper.
12172 The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems.
12173 There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place.
12174 Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit.
12175 The staff is very friendly and talkative.
12176 If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets.
12177 The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums.
12178 $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.
12179 I enrolled my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter into Hubbard.
12180 They've completed 2 swim lessons each and the results are dramatic.
12181 They have made huge strives in their water skills.
12182 Plus, it seems to enable them with confidence and self esteem after each lesson.
12183 You want to go to Four Peaks.
12184 Trust me.
12185 We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school.
12186 The food is a 4, but the waitresses are a 5.
12187 It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions.
12188 This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular.
12189 We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.
12190 They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted.
12191 He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.
12192 They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.
12193 Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.
12194 We went maybe twice for lunch, but almost always for dinner.
12195 My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly.
12196 Groupon rip-off.
12197 Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate.
12198 All for an advertised value of $90.
12199 Will NEVER return.
12200 Dr. Kanarish was exactly how I expected he would be by the other reviews I read on Yelp and Google.
12201 His staff was very friendly and the facility is extremely clean.
12202 I have an 8 year old Boxer that needed a large tumor type growth removed from his paw and was given very high estimates from different hospitals.
12203 Phoenix Mountain Animal gave me a very reasonable price on the initial exam and the actual removal, stitches, etc... ended up being much more affordable than any place I had called.
12204 I was originally offered care credit( a payment plan) but I ended up not needing it because the bill was within reason.
12205 I just picked up my dog and he was a little sleepy from the local anesthetic, so we will see how the next few days go.
12206 A great first experience and am planning on transferring all our future visits to see Dr. Karanish.
12207 It's great to see there are honest and compassionate Doctors around.
12208 I hope anyone looking for an exceptional Dr. will consider Dr. Karanish.
12209 I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon.
12210 I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors.
12211 My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101.
12212 I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.
12213 I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad.
12214 I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me.
12215 I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out.
12216 I went with the Coco Coca.
12217 The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there.
12218 The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions.
12219 I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself.
12220 Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad.
12221 I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad.
12222 I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette.
12223 The salad was delicious.
12224 The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad.
12225 The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals.
12226 I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses.
12227 Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me.
12228 I can't wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!
12229 Went here and we had a groupon.
12230 The ambiance was awesome.
12231 Two stories down, you enter a cozy space.
12232 We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar.
12233 Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner.
12234 It was delicious and they cracked it table side.
12235 We definitely will be back again.
12236 First off, I am not a Cubs fan.
12237 But I came here to watch them play the A's during spring training and thought this park rocked.
12238 Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players, but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Field...including Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish.
12239 All this and sunshine too!
12240 What's not to like?
12241 we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try.
12242 the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu).
12243 for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign.
12244 but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test.
12245 our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing.
12246 the decor is "country" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining.
12247 i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce.
12248 i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth.
12249 my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right.
12250 she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine.
12251 her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful.
12252 i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here.
12253 well worth the bike ride.
12254 I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions)
12255 1.
12256 Nobuo at Teeter House.
12257 2.
12258 Fez.
12259 3.
12260 My friends in various parts of the valley
12261 and
12262 4.
12263 Mekong Supermarket.
12264 I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine.
12265 Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian.
12266 You name it, I'll eat it.
12267 I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.
12268 Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses.
12269 The aroma and sensations from the exotic product.
12270 The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged.
12271 The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker.
12272 The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar.
12273 This place has it all.
12274 I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood.
12275 Want a live crab?
12276 Boom.
12277 Done.
12278 Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap?
12279 It's yours.
12280 To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want.
12281 Make the trek.
12282 You won't regret it.
12283 Okay, I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward.
12284 Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!
12285 Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.
12286 It was quaint.
12287 It was old school.
12288 It kinda made me a little nervous!
12289 The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.
12290 Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.
12291 Our water glass was NEVER refilled.
12292 Got a little more nervous.
12293 They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).
12294 My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.
12295 I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.
12296 I ordered the Chicken al Berto.
12297 My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.
12298 We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.
12299 The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!
12300 Nom nom nom.
12301 The balsamic was excellent as well.
12302 I must now do peppers with my Caprese!
12303 Then our entrees came out.
12304 My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.
12305 There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.
12306 I'm super happy it was!
12307 This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.
12308 The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.
12309 The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.
12310 The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.
12311 Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!!
12312 OMG!!
12313 Freaking amazing!
12314 I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!
12315 Divine.
12316 It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's "chill" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.
12317 I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.
12318 The portion of entrees were HUGE.
12319 My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.
12320 Fresh, fresh, fresh.
12321 It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.
12322 And I think the prices were pretty good.
12323 Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.
12324 I'm so there next week!
12325 Oh, and put your phone on vibrate.
12326 They kind of insist!
12327 And that's okay too!
12328 I found Lisa G's while driving through phoenix with a friend.
12329 The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat.
12330 We were in for a a shock!
12331 We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it, it turned out to be the best thing we were served.
12332 I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad!
12333 The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash, corn, green beans, etc.)
12334 was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes.
12335 It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had!
12336 My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess.
12337 Just horrible food!
12338 I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty.
12339 I wish I had ordered those.
12340 As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!
12341 I just celebrated my birthday at Oregano's.
12342 I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.
12343 ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.
12344 Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!
12345 Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails we'd never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.
12346 All per her recommendations.
12347 Can't wait to come here again.
12348 OMG try their breakfast burritos!!!!
12349 Habanero's has good, cheap, fast Mexican food.
12350 Went there last night with no expectations.
12351 From the beginning to the end, including the "bread basket" with blue cheese butter and pesto on top, the lamb chop appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the creme brulee in a flaky phillo cup lightly burnt on top, it was probably one of the best overall meals I've had in years.
12352 Thanks Eddie for stopping by our table and checking on us and chatting a bit.
12353 Very friendly wait staff and no attitude whatsoever from anybody and very comfortable.
12354 This place is a model for how it should be done.
12355 I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant.
12356 1) I ordered a cheese platter.
12357 The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00.
12358 The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them.
12359 The same is true with Pizza.
12360 If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza.
12361 Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it.
12362 AVOID THIS!
12363 !
12364 2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon.
12365 We ordered two glasses of red wine.
12366 The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.
12367 The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines.
12368 To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.
12369 Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago.
12370 It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.
12371 AVOID.
12372 Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now.
12373 For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours.
12374 We finally made it today, and boy, were we glad.
12375 I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie, which has chocolate chips and walnuts.
12376 The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy.
12377 The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special, but when they rotated it out people yelled at them.
12378 After taking one bite, I totally understood why.
12379 The cupcake is the best I've ever had.
12380 The vanilla frosting is not too sweet, perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth.
12381 I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours!
12382 3 stars on any given day, my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars.
12383 Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does.
12384 I asked him, "how long" and with much joy he replied, "I can get your food in 10-15 minutes".
12385 Sure enough it took 9 minutes.
12386 I value time and in my business my word is everything.
12387 Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table.
12388 I recommend you do the same.
12389 ASK FOR PAT!!
12390 !
12391 Top notch Pat.
12392 Don't ever change.
12393 Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu.
12394 This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had!
12395 I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of "chain sushi" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu.
12396 There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan!
12397 Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants!
12398 You won't be disappointed.
12399 The area and building are misleading...
12400 However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you.
12401 This is real sushi...
12402 Go try and enjoy!
12403 please please please do not stay here!
12404 i never do these reviews but i feel obligated to save someone the time and money and self respect by writing this review!
12405 the customer service is soooo soooo poor!!
12406 after having almost 500.00 held on my charge card after i checked out, i called to find out why this charge was on my account.
12407 i was hung up on and after calling back was repeatedly hung up on and refused to provide his name to me or his managers name!
12408 i told him i work at a four star hotel and casino in las vegas (which i do).
12409 he called me a liar!
12410 .. and as of right now still out 500.00!
12411 what establishment hangs up on their guests?
12412 this guy should sit through some of the forbes training i have received!
12413 what if i was a shopper?
12414 do not stay here!
12415 save your money!
12416 they only received one star because you have to provide a rating.
12417 aside from the horrible customer service, they stuck me with a 50 penalty fee when i had to change locations.
12418 that wasnt great, but whatever, the pictures do not resemble the motel.
12419 the "game room" is not a game room.
12420 its a room with an atari in it.
12421 the pool was small and dirty and if you like noise all night while you are trying to sleep, you can count on it here.
12422 all these things, i could get over.
12423 however, the customer service the man (i cant even say gentleman) on the phone was horrible and penalty should follow.
12424 he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services.
12425 do not stay here!
12426 you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner.
12427 i should have known better for such an inexpensive place, but i was hoping if we cut back on the hotel we could spend extra money with the kids doing activities and going places... wrong!
12428 you get what you pay for... and worse!
12429 Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy
12430 ever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!
12431 !
12432 I can't really say enough about Liberty Market.
12433 The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome.
12434 I haven't had anything that I didn't like.
12435 From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny.
12436 For me though, it's all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries.
12437 These are completely off the chart awesome!
12438 You simply MUST try them!
12439 Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time.
12440 Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met.
12441 Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting.
12442 Oh!
12443 As weird as it sounds, you have to check out the bathrooms, they are the best I have ever seen.
12444 (seriously)
12445 Michael came out today and he was great!
12446 Our patio door was a bear to open and he put new hardware on and voila!
12447 It seriously opens with 1 finger.
12448 He was quick, affordable, knowledgeable and very nice.
12449 Scheduling was easy and the office staff was kind.
12450 A+!
12451 I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.
12452 The food was not good, the service was awful.
12453 They got all of our orders mixed upo.
12454 Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.
12455 PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.
12456 There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place.
12457 Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash!
12458 !
12459 I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries.
12460 This is not just an Oriental Supermarket, they are a World Market.
12461 Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country.
12462 I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well, they are bound by the limitations of their distributors.
12463 I will be there again soon for a mini-staycation!!!
12464 !
12465 This review is pretty much for the bra department at Nordstrom.
12466 They are amazing at their jobs.
12467 I finally found out that Victoria's Secret is that their bras suck!
12468 So I bought a bra online to pick up at the store, but when I went in and tried it on, it didn't fit.
12469 I thought that sizes for that brand ran a little differently.
12470 I told the sales girl, and she asked me if I minded if she measured me.
12471 I said sure and she followed me into the dressing room.
12472 When we got in there she told me to take off my top!
12473 I'll be honest here, I thought she was going to measure me over my shirt, and I almost peed a little.
12474 I decided to pretend like it was no big deal to take my top off in front of a total stranger, and just took it off.
12475 Not sure if she noticed my slight hesitation, but she probably did, oh well.
12476 I generally like to go on a couple of dates before I take my top off if you know what I am saying.
12477 Well guess what?
12478 That is the best way to get a good measurement it turns out!
12479 The salesgirl told me to wait a few moments and she would be back with some bras.
12480 She came back with two of the most wonderful, comfortable, and supportive bras I have ever owned!
12481 So instead of getting one bra that day, I got two.
12482 I have to say, my hat (or my top) is off to Nordstrom for training their staff to be great at their jobs, and for having fabulous bras.
12483 Ladies, please don't bother buying another bra at Victoria's Secret!
12484 Run to Nordstrom next time you need a quality bra to support your girls.
12485 :)
12486 If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you.
12487 Education is horrible.
12488 If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one.
12489 I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields.
12490 This institution is a joke.
12491 I was there last week with my sisters and while we ordered our steaks cooked medium, all of them came out well done.
12492 Kind of disappointed, but oh well.
12493 So last night my fiance and I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we headed over.
12494 When I ordered my steak cooked medium, I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week.
12495 When our food came out, she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted.
12496 I did and, while it was a bit more medium-well than medium, I was hungry and it looked good, so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal.
12497 It really was a good steak.
12498 When our waitress came out again, she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly.
12499 I assured her it was fine.
12500 A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it.
12501 I assured him it was maybe a little overdone, but it was good and I was happy with my meal.
12502 They were being very nice and showing some great customer service, though a little overzealous.
12503 :)
12504 When the bill came, they had made my steak the free one for the coupon, even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered.
12505 Great customer service, and very good food.
12506 I love sprinkles cupcakes.
12507 I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal.
12508 Like every location, the taste and quality is consistent and delicious.
12509 I got the salt caramel, banana, and carrot this time around.
12510 Like always, it's delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does.
12511 My pup loves the pupcakes too.
12512 I would wait for these cupcakes any time.
12513 My favorite place by far and well worth the drive from Gilbert.
12514 Love the atmosphere, bruschetta, and of course the wine.
12515 Great place to catch up with friends.
12516 I can't wait for the location in Gilbert to open up.
12517 My husband and I went there for our first time today.
12518 What a mistake.
12519 First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands.
12520 My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch.
12521 There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.
12522 The inside trash was overflowing.
12523 I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again.
12524 This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams!
12525 I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg.
12526 I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop.
12527 I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung.
12528 They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).
12529 I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris).
12530 I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.
12531 They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections.
12532 I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings).
12533 I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work.
12534 Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies.
12535 Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margarita's before you get seated are a must.
12536 When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.
12537 A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.
12538 When you go go with friends and don't have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it.
12539 I will make this real easy for you.
12540 Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor.
12541 I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.
12542 I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.
12543 Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.
12544 For the size and price - order multiples.
12545 Love the salsa bar.
12546 Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.
12547 I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market.
12548 I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.
12549 Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting.
12550 Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)
12551 "The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10.
12552 They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell.
12553 Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave.
12554 They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you!
12555 BE AFRAID!!!!
12556 They are dedicated to working against, not with you."
12557 been coming here since birth
12558 Well, what a pleasant surprise!
12559 I stopped by with my children to check it out - planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats gluten-free, etc., etc.
12560 Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat Haüs are all about.
12561 Great food and a desire to serve!
12562 Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!
12563 And he threw in a few organic surprises.
12564 Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.
12565 On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.
12566 She chose the wrap (more fun) and loved it.
12567 I have NEVER had personalized service like this!
12568 Cool place, cool patio, great beer selection, great-tasting unique food selections, and, best of all, great people!
12569 Congrats Dave and Payton!
12570 It doesn't matter which location you go to, it's all the same and GREAT!!
12571 !
12572 There's the sweetest (and cutest) guy who works there and one time, my total came to 5.45, i had a 5 in my hand as I was scraping for change in my dance bag but he was like "its on me."
12573 and took it from his tips!
12574 I know its just 45 cents and i could probably find that under the seats in my car but he truly made my day with something so little like that!
12575 I LOVE this place!!
12576 :D
12577 Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight.
12578 Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...
12579 Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.
12580 Super nice staff, delicious bagels.
12581 Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing.
12582 BEST PANCAKES!!!
12583 We want the recipe.
12584 They're newly remodeled and better than ever.
12585 Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices.
12586 Great food, great people!
12587 I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years...
12588 I've tried it all!
12589 gym memberships, pilates, training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything... until Karve that is!
12590 My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it (not sure what he was trying to hint at with that... but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care :)
12591 Anyway, I went and am now hooked!
12592 it is the greatest work out ever - its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating... and its really the only workout routine that I've ever been able to stick with ever!
12593 and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite - I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me (a former carb/chocolate fiend)
12594 It really helped me finally get into a more active/healthy lifestyle - I know that sounds so cliche but I'm still shocked everyday that a lazyass/sweets-eating like me is actually working out on a regular basis - and its all bc of the great method of Karve.... plus the instructors are SO sweet and nice/friendly and supportive I'm honestly making friends there... all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio!!
12595 i'm a believer :)
12596 Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here.
12597 We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend.
12598 Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.
12599 Good:
12600 1) Gigantic, comfy bed.
12601 I slept like a queen.
12602 2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area.
12603 3) Outstanding bathroom.
12604 The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.
12605 4) Cool decor both interior and exterior.
12606 Bad:
12607 1) Bed pillows were too squishy.
12608 2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough.
12609 I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.
12610 3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea.
12611 Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.
12612 Ugly:
12613 1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really "ugly".
12614 Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit.
12615 Coffee-meh.
12616 Not great, not horrible.
12617 Scone-dry.
12618 Service-ridiculously slow.
12619 The night we were there (8/11), the owner came and asked a group of people (who were clearly having some sort of meeting) to stop talking because they were "disturbing the guitar player."
12620 Chased 8 paying customers (at least I assume they were paying customers; they all had drinks) out the door.
12621 Weird!!
12622 Don't think I'll be going back.
12623 I would've gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving.
12624 I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant.
12625 But then, I tasted it.
12626 It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise.
12627 It's was like a bomb had gone off.
12628 The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor.
12629 The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs.
12630 When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight.
12631 We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors.
12632 The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup.
12633 This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.
12634 The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be.
12635 Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana.
12636 Where did the yogurt part go?
12637 And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly?
12638 The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.
12639 The decor didn't add to our experience.
12640 Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like.
12641 Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.
12642 A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid.
12643 We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes.
12644 We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.
12645 I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I won't be returning to find out if this was the case.
12646 I had the Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce, and it was unreal.
12647 Cute little place.
12648 I didn't sit to eat so I can't comment on the service, but they were extremely amicable when I ordered my take out.
12649 The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.
12650 In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, "ok, time out!
12651 I'm the customer.
12652 Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues.".
12653 They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.
12654 We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!
12655 Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, "I thought you said...".
12656 Still had the order wrong!
12657 Whew!
12658 One of my fondest memories as a child is traveling to Alameda to visit my great-grandparents, one of which was Filipino.
12659 The food!
12660 Yum!!
12661 !
12662 It had been years since either my mom or I had Filipino food.
12663 We both moved to Arkansas 20+ years ago but I recently moved to the valley.
12664 The first time I came across Hey Joe was last Spring when my mom was in town and we visited the Old Town Scottsdale Farmer's Market.
12665 Pancit?
12666 Lumpia?
12667 I was beyond excited when I saw the truck.
12668 Yes, I get excited about good food.
12669 Everything was fabulous.
12670 I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious.
12671 Service is great, prices are wonderful.
12672 I will definitely be back.
12673 This place was the worst place to EVER live!
12674 I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011, i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed??
12675 the office always gave me the run around very rude.
12676 You would think after the gun shoots, assaults, and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed.
12677 When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.
12678 Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works!
12679 living here was SO gross!
12680 nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross.
12681 I hated living here!
12682  But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out!
12683 I called them up like wtf, and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt, we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages.
12684 They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull.
12685 I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!
12686 Thank you so much for the good reviews.
12687 I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010.
12688 I ate soo much I hurt myself.
12689 Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry.
12690 The staff was excellent and very kind.
12691 I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone.
12692 ;)
12693 This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time.
12694 I've been many times and it's always fabulous.
12695 I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good!
12696 I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew.
12697 The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious.
12698 This place is also good for Sunday brunch.
12699 Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak.
12700 This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria.
12701 We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities.
12702 We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond.
12703 There is even a Starbuck's.
12704 We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before.
12705 It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement "bar" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement "tables" behind on which to do prep work.
12706 There were also sinks in the center to wash up.
12707 Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group.
12708 What a fantastic set up!
12709 Great job, Peoria!
12710 If you like P.F.
12711 Changs, you will love Pei Wei!
12712 It's essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting, & Take-Out!
12713 I can't tell a difference between their Orange Chicken, or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag!!
12714 !
12715 My favorite dish here is the Dan-Dan Noodles!
12716 (It's Hot.
12717 Spicy, & Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under $10!!!)
12718 If you have not heard; "Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food!"
12719 Well neither is Panda Express, but I'll tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express & most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US!
12720 Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants!
12721 (NO MSG!)
12722 "Can you believe the balls on this guy!?"
12723 We'll I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco, LA, NY, Vancouver & Dallas!
12724 I've even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong; don't be impressed it was not that good!
12725 I love Chinese food, but I really love Asian Fusion!
12726 Roy's, PF Changs, & Pei Wei really wet my noodle!
12727 The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out!
12728 I have them on speed dial...
12729 So when I'm on my way home from work I'll call, & as I pull in I pay, pick up, and go!
12730 It's freshly cooked & No Wait!!
12731 !
12732 They finally just opened a Rita's location in Surprise!!
12733 I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.
12734 I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months.
12735 It's hard to explain the texture of the ice.
12736 It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink.
12737 Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's.
12738 I guess that's why it's Italian ice.
12739 It's in its own category!
12740 There are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink).
12741 You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone.
12742 One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish.
12743 There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple.
12744 I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing!
12745 The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices.
12746 There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change.
12747 Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt.
12748 Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet!
12749 Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place.
12750 After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands.
12751 It was an issue of "protecting the thumbs."
12752 When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too).
12753 After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the "therapist for [me]."
12754 She was right.
12755 What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff?
12756 I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.
12757 This place has to get all five stars.
12758 Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices.
12759 This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.
12760 They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.
12761 5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:
12762  ~ Beautiful food.
12763 Unique flavors.
12764  ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all
12765  ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal
12766  ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.
12767  ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.
12768 ***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.
12769 ***
12770 LOVE it and so close to home!
12771 Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week (Yes, really!)
12772 The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek Pita-Oh my!
12773 The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals!
12774 The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.
12775 Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms.
12776 The staff is also  extremely friendly.
12777 While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.
12778 We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.
12779 Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street.
12780 Awesome food and service!
12781 How did I not know this is right across the street from my house?
12782 ?
12783 I woudn't describe myself as a crafter or DIYer, but man this place has all kinds of fancy papers, from traditional to fun and contemporary!
12784 I bought these vintage anatomical papers that I plan to make posters from.
12785 The best part is that they were only $3.50!
12786 They even sell Japanese Copic markers, take that Az art supply!
12787 Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!
12788 Go now, before it's too late!
12789 Delicious gourmet crepes.
12790 Friendly staff.
12791 Awesome environment.
12792 Price is right.
12793 Eat here, it's good.
12794 Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place.
12795 Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food.
12796 Pearl is an exception to the rule.
12797 The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock.
12798 I love that they have different flavors for edamame, cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good.
12799 All of that would equal four stars in my book, fifth star is given to the staff.
12800 Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like.
12801 Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive.
12802 Always goes the extra mile, I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable.
12803 Overall great value and relaxed attitude.
12804 Excellent.
12805 Fresh and yummy!
12806 When I was growing up we called this the canal.
12807 In other parts of town it is still called the canal.
12808 In some places people actually fish from it.
12809 I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you don't see them very often.
12810 Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.
12811 Google it.
12812 What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isn't the same heinous canal that's always been there.
12813 When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about.
12814 What water?
12815 Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal.
12816 Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.
12817 You are not fooling anyone.
12818 Service was slow and horrible.
12819 Got the steak and eggs.
12820 Steak was half fat.
12821 Waiters response was "Oh!
12822 We have a new supplier".
12823 He didnt take it back and charged us any way.
12824 Eggs were cold.
12825 Stay away from this place for eating.
12826 Bar looked happening.
12827 This is one of my favorite bars in the area.
12828 The bar has a good vibe, the food is good, and the bartenders are attentive.
12829 The prices are reasonable so you can have a good time without digging too deeply into your pockets.
12830 Wow!
12831 I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews.
12832 I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal.
12833 But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food?
12834 Dry and sticky rice; "white meat chicken" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor.
12835 Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them).
12836 I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall.
12837 The one star is only for the fast and friendly service.
12838 This was a terrible experience.
12839 You can not reach anyone via phone, you have to book online, which I did and also requested a phone call.
12840 I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.
12841 I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.
12842 Still no call.
12843 The cleaners arrived & I had someone let them in.
12844 When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms & they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!
12845 The sinks were dirty, with tooth paste splatters on sink, the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.
12846 I am so unhappy about this.
12847 I have tried to reach them every day since & have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.
12848 DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!
12849 I had an amazing facial here!
12850 The space is clean, inviting and relaxing.
12851 Park in the lot south of the building, it is less crowded.
12852 After an hour of pampering my skin was glowing!
12853 They offer many of different services including laser treatments.
12854 I will be back for some more aggressive treatments to fix up my flaws (not that I have any)!
12855 Anyway, the staff is very professional.
12856 Before or after your treatment go next door for some great Thai food!
12857 Bliss, Delight, Contentment... words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens.
12858 I could go into a very fluffy review, but, with a nod to the simple zen-like restaurant, I will only address and highlight.
12859 ~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed.
12860 ~Attentive, but not aggressive server...great attitude!
12861 ~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven.
12862 ~Homemade infused alcohol.. finally in Phoenix!
12863 ~Open kitchen, I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal.
12864 All items served "tapas" style... great opportunity to try many items!
12865 Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience... either enjoy the food natural, or enhance with dipping sauces.
12866 These are not the heavy, sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame.
12867 ~Mango Spring roll.. light, fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced
12868 ~Soup Gyoza, 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate broth..divine!
12869 ~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone, then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts,... try a dip of the accompanying sauce...ecstasy, prepare to order 2 they're so good!
12870 ~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp "hushpuppys".. very good, but not the highlight of the evening.. Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion.
12871 ~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique, yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian "slaw"
12872 ~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these.. familiar flavors, with wonderful dipping sauces.
12873 No-one in our party was disappointed... everyone was very pleased and anxious to return.
12874 ** Personal Suggestion ***
12875 Have a food allergy ??
12876 .. Use common sense when dining.
12877 Take personal responsibility and ask questions of your server BEFORE ordering.
12878 So the food at this place is good.
12879 Well the sliced turkey sud.
12880 But when it came to delivery and internet ordering.
12881 Oh my god the incompetence of these people.
12882 After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.)
12883 I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%.
12884 But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs.
12885 So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub.
12886 Ugh they never checked the order.
12887 If you have online ordering  you need to follow though.
12888 So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat.
12889 The only good thing i got was a free lunch.
12890 For that I give them a 1
12891 I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza.
12892 It is just like being back in Chicago.
12893 Love it!
12894 Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes!
12895 Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace.
12896 I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner.
12897 We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees.
12898 I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe.
12899 With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an
12900 a subtle breading on the zucchini.
12901 We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch.
12902 The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun.
12903 Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week.
12904 My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger.
12905 Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased.
12906 I found the decor charming and elegant.
12907 The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants.
12908 The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid.
12909 I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.
12910 We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular.
12911 For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.
12912 Everything was wonderful.
12913 The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.
12914 Everything was cooked skillfully.
12915 Had three of the four desserts on the menu.
12916 The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.
12917 Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat.
12918 The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like.
12919 The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine.
12920 I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional.
12921 We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit.
12922 This place has amazing pizza and great service.
12923 I've been 3 times and have not been disappointed.
12924 We've come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties, and you can do family style and share or get individual portions.
12925 Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters, and I love the signature spinach pizza.
12926 Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and I'm glad I took the suggestion!
12927 Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it.
12928 Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool :) pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy!
12929 The staff of this "establishment" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life.
12930 They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff).
12931 The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves, they know nothing about fashion whatsoever.
12932 Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite, "trendy" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses.
12933 I was there about a year ago, and one of their young female employees was laughing, snarking and making faces at me.
12934 I had no idea who she was.
12935 It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something.
12936 Today, their manager called me something that I can't even print on here.
12937 I had never seen him in my life, either.
12938 I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them.
12939 Avoid this place at all cost, they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange.
12940 Simply the best Ethiopian I've ever had.
12941 Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds (home of a large Ethiopian population) and even had a good amount of Ethiopian home-cooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place.
12942 I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in.
12943 I usually get the veggie or meat-lovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain, but have also ordered separate items as well.
12944 The vibe is casual and the service is excellent.
12945 The staff have always been very friendly --- another reason I keep going back.
12946 Very impressed!
12947 $5 pitcher until 5pm, and excellent healthy food at a good value.
12948 Free valet parking.
12949 I look forward to coming back.
12950 This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House.
12951 Great food with excellent customer service.
12952 My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non-clean district manager (Kyle I was told is his name)
12953 This place is absolute perfection.
12954 From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.
12955 The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.
12956 You seriously are my trusty sidekick.
12957 From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.
12958 Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.
12959 It really does feel like an upscale country home.
12960 Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.
12961 Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.
12962 Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.
12963 We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.
12964 Both were absolutely delightful!
12965 Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.
12966 We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.
12967 I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.
12968 Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.
12969 Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!
12970 The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!
12971 The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!
12972 Well that, along with the bread and butter.
12973 But that still wasn't enough for me!
12974 I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!
12975 After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.
12976 I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.
12977 Then the entrees came.
12978 The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.
12979 Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!
12980 I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.
12981 I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.
12982 My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.
12983 And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.
12984 Could life get any better?
12985 Well apparently it could!
12986 After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!
12987 We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.
12988 And the berries with the creme fraiche.
12989 Heaven in my mouth!
12990 We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.
12991 This review cannot do this place justice.
12992 This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.
12993 Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!
12994 Amazing work!
12995 My dentist referred me to this place just down the street from her.
12996 I was super scared, as I always am at the dentist, but the staff made me feel very comfortable.
12997 They treated me like a patient at the hospital.
12998 They were my angel nurses.
12999 When Dr Amin came in, the "nurse" was holding my hand and telling me when to breathe.
13000 I was, of course, shaking like a leaf.
13001 The Dr "popped" me three times in the cheek, and I was all numb.
13002 When I say "popped", I mean it was an electric shock wave pop flowing through my face to my freaking eyeball that made me tear up a little.
13003 (this was done by the needle of course going into my cheek)  It was the craziest feeling, but relieving at the same time.
13004 I just breathed through it, and it helped.
13005 After about a min, the Dr was working his magic.
13006 In about 45 mins, he was all done, and I had like 4 canals.
13007 And I didn't feel a thing!!
13008 :)
13009 I was very pleased with the staff, Dr Amin, and the work they did.
13010 I highly recommend this place if you need a root canal done.
13011 Plus if you're a scardy cat like me, this place makes you feel comfortable.
13012 Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.
13013 Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please!
13014 How many times before I can force myself to experiment?
13015 This place is great!
13016 Just opened up on central just south of camelback on the west side of the road.
13017 ...AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need!
13018 Family owned, really friendly staff, free wifi, flat screen tvs,....also just saw a flier for a monday movie night...I guess they are gonna have double features on mondays...even made a specialty drink for the night....sounds like fun!
13019 ...cool little spot, dont hesitate to check this place out!
13020 Really?
13021 Because it doesn't get any better than this.
13022 For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.
13023 A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.
13024 What is a pasty?
13025 A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.
13026 The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.
13027 Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the "handles" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.
13028 At the Cornish Pasty Co.
13029 I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.
13030 Very good flavoring and filling.
13031 Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.
13032 The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.
13033 Pros
13034 * Good food
13035 * Originality
13036 * Portions
13037 * Customer service
13038 * Coat hooks at the bar
13039 Cons
13040 * Small interior
13041 Coming from a French family on my mom's side it is ingrained in my genes to love cooking, food, and shops like Sur La Table...oh and also wine and cheese...what a tough life I live!
13042 Sur La Table is a classy cooking shop which offers high end cooking ware, appliances, and also dishes.
13043 Somethings in the store can be pricey, but you can also find good deals as well.
13044 They offer many cooking things you wouldn't find at your average Crate and Barrel for more complicated cooking endeavors.
13045 I have also found some cute cookie cutters here for my mom's collection.
13046 The staff was all very helpful and knowledgeable.
13047 and many Sur La Table's now offer cooking classes!
13048 These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out.
13049 Great decor and hot, hot waitresses.
13050 We had lunch and it was pretty quiet.
13051 Good service.
13052 I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!
13053 Truly a hiden gem in Chandler.
13054 Located south of Chandler Boulevard, just off of Roosevelt (next to Archery HeadQuarters).
13055 Wanda's is a small yet quaint, twelve tables inside and 5 outside.
13056 Outside is for sure seasonal, as summers are too hot and dead of winter can be too cold.
13057 Wait times on a Sunday or Saturday can be 10-15 minutes during the "rush times", which is a quarter the wait time you would experiece at the near-by chains.
13058 The menu offers a variety to satisfy and hunger (except if you want lunch on weekends, it's breakfast all day, lunch from 11-2 during the week).
13059 The burritos are awesome.
13060 Ladies, I guarantee you will take half home!
13061 My husband likes the Biscuits and Gravy.
13062 The bacon is amazing and addicting often I have to smack my families hands away from grooping a piece.
13063 French toast, cinnamon raisin french toast and pancakes if you brought your sweet tooth =)   Build your omeltes are good too (tip, add a side of salsa, you won't be sorry, it is made fresh daily and goes perfect with a ham and cheese omelete).
13064 Service is exceptionally friendly, a lot of regulars and the servers know what you usually drink and sometimes can have your order written unless you throw a curve ball and veer from your usual.
13065 A+ Wanda!
13066 I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I haven't stopped coming back.
13067 The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes.
13068 A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito.
13069 Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side.
13070 For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy).
13071 There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account.
13072 This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)!
13073 Yum!
13074 There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.
13075 The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables).
13076 The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)
13077 Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to.
13078 Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home.
13079 The best thing about Karey's Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley!
13080 Sundae for Sunday.
13081 Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat.
13082 This place has a top notch tuna tataki app!
13083 Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are.
13084 Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price.
13085 Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!!
13086 I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars.
13087 Half the fun is the wait.....If you are going to go, you may as well get into it.
13088 We get into it, at their Italian place next door and drink tons of wine.
13089 L and I later that night had a hot kiss and she lost her precious earrings.
13090 I even drove back the next day to look for them somewhere against the wall.
13091 Just kissing, but hot, if you lose earrings.
13092 We went twice once alone, and the 2nd time with her sons and friends.
13093 We ordered every pizza imaginable.
13094 It seems almost every high end pizza now, is brick oven and more about the crust.
13095 I like everyone else will mention, I am from the East Coast and know pizza.
13096 Best in the United States, we have several that are at that level.
13097 You can flip a coin on which one is better.
13098 Love chickafila :) they're pretty pricey for fast food though
13099 Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.
13100 When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?
13101 WRONG.
13102 You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.
13103 Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.
13104 THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.
13105 I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.
13106 So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!
13107 Nello's is the best!
13108 Great local feel, great food, love this place.
13109 You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.
13110 It will soon be your go to feel good order.
13111 When I was recovering from surgery, I received of one of their arrangements.
13112 It was marvelous.
13113 The quality was unbeatable, with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation.
13114 They lasted for weeks.
13115 I am really pleased with this company and wouldn't hesitate to use them again!
13116 I would just like to start off by saying that I love egg salad sandwiches.
13117 I have probably tried an egg salad sandwich anywhere that serves egg salad.
13118 Sacks is BY FAR, the BEST egg salad sandwich (entitled "The Dali") I have ever had in my life.
13119 I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks.
13120 On top of the wonderful menu, whenever you order a sandwich from them, the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie, which is amazing all in itself.
13121 If you like their cookies, you can purchase the cookie dough.
13122 They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well.
13123 I have been eating here for at least 14 years, and I hope they NEVER go away!
13124 I have found my new favorite sushi spot.
13125 I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.
13126 You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant.
13127 You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them.
13128 Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi.
13129 On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were.
13130 The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor.
13131 The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious.
13132 They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.
13133 The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday.
13134 The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray.
13135 "Hey, fire!"
13136 I thought.
13137 It was a nice touch.
13138 Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish.
13139 I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.
13140 Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience.
13141 Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green.
13142 The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand.
13143 But there it was, no extra charge.
13144 It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi.
13145 The sushi was great.
13146 They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them.
13147 Next time.
13148 Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend.
13149 I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it.
13150 However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go.
13151 Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends
13152 This little taco shop gets 5+ stars!
13153 The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection.
13154 I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite.
13155 I also tried molotes for the first time.
13156 The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy.
13157 The quesadillas are like cheese crisps.
13158 I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since it's so close to home.
13159 I have to try the other items in their menu soon.
13160 Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50.
13161 I like to think of Trader Joe's as a "specialty food/health market."
13162 It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains.
13163 Honestly, there is no comparison!
13164 With that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too!
13165 (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!
13166 The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.
13167 And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!
13168 Some of my fav's are:
13169 $3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price!
13170 (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.)
13171 I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find!
13172 The Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious!
13173 Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.
13174 They even have Nulaid "Ready Egg" (i.e.
13175 egg beaters) for $3.69!
13176 At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!
13177 !
13178 Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable!
13179 Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a "low fat/fat free" food, so that is a once every few months splurge.
13180 (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a "little bastard."
13181 That name CRACKS me up!)
13182 And although I am not a "sweet" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here.
13183 The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.)
13184 I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable!
13185 It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do!
13186 There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags.
13187 (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.
13188 If you shop more than once a week, you can "earn" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning.
13189 (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )
13190 Regardless, this is just a great little "market" through and through.
13191 I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there!
13192 (and it's not just to try and win the gift card either..that's an added bonus!)
13193 Great Brisket.
13194 There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time.
13195 There is now!.
13196 The food is wonderful and priced well.
13197 Stop in and grab a bite.
13198 I had initially checked this place out a couple of months ago.
13199 Once again we found ourselves needing some quick, delicious breakfast and decided to try this place out again.
13200 As before it was absolutely delicious.
13201 The one thing that surprised me this time around however was the little play area toward the back of the restaurant.
13202 This is very impressive to me as it gave us some much needed peace prior to getting our food.
13203 Thank you Bertha's Cafe for not only being so accommodating, but also for having such wonderful food.
13204 Feeling a bit weary from a steady stream of travel, we decided to head over here for my favorite Rx, Pho.
13205 A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp, pork and vermicelli, dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce, a dash of their house hot sauce(a tad more fire than the "cock" sauce) and we were off to  a fine start.
13206 I was feeling better already.
13207 The Pho arrived, and the aromas were simply intoxicating.
13208 After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria, we dug in, adding the usual lime, cilantro, basil, sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce.
13209 Commence slurping.
13210 The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors.
13211 Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture.
13212 My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly.
13213 I selected the special beef which included shank, brisket, tendon, tripe and meatball.
13214 Outstanding.
13215 Service was with a smile, prompt and attentive.
13216 I honestly felt like I was sitting in someone's home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis.
13217 I do not think that Cyclo can compare, while good, this just seemed more authentic.
13218 Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix.
13219 His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find.
13220 Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny.
13221 I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.
13222 Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget.
13223 OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one.
13224 If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.
13225 When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock.
13226 We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa.
13227 At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine.
13228 Talk about knowing people?
13229 One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri!
13230 Wow.
13231 (That's another review.)
13232 And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).
13233 When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?)
13234 who made a comeback some years later.
13235 For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name.
13236 After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors?
13237 LOL.
13238 Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's.
13239 The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London.
13240 Very posh, yet understated.
13241 Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.
13242 The menu is a very difficult one.
13243 I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection.
13244 Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm....
13245 I could go on and on.
13246 So does the menu, page after page.
13247 Some might call the preparations simplistic.
13248 This is the Tuscan way.
13249 Simple ingredients and simple preparation.
13250 Let the ingredients make their own magic.
13251 Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.
13252 Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!!
13253 -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner.
13254 Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.
13255 Daniel himself is a wonderful host.
13256 He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience.
13257 There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix.
13258 Most of it is just American Italian.
13259 Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant.
13260 Enjoy.
13261 P.S.
13262 [post edit] OMG.
13263 How could I forget the Tiramisu?
13264 It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to.
13265 Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again.
13266 I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient.
13267 You'll have to ask Daniel.
13268 Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore.
13269 These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.
13270 Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure).
13271 With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.
13272 First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books.
13273 I believe most of their used books are $7.50.
13274 They are also all in pristine condition.
13275 Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback.
13276 You can do better online quite often.
13277 What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well.
13278 This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.
13279 Second, the location of CH is perfect.
13280 This is one of the best plazas out there.
13281 Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.
13282 Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that.
13283 The staff is extremely friendly.
13284 From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that.
13285 The store also has a very welcoming feel to it.
13286 Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is.
13287 No, not just the staff--the customers.
13288 Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy.
13289 They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen.
13290 Someone will ask the staff "who wrote such and such?".
13291 The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  "who wrote such and such".
13292 If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up.
13293 It's this type of thing that makes it a great store.
13294 Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.
13295 The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is.
13296 There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured.
13297 Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.
13298 I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to.
13299 Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers.
13300 The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful.
13301 I just wish it was a Marketplace instead.
13302 I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again.
13303 The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky.
13304 We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill.
13305 The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl.
13306 There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost.
13307 I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan.
13308 I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite.
13309 Free-range and refills on beverages.
13310 Sat down to eat, was not impressed.
13311 I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting.
13312 The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well.
13313 We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving.
13314 Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections.
13315 We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead.
13316 Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.
13317 Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time.
13318 UH-mazing!
13319 Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of.
13320 Best part about it was that it was super affordable.
13321 It was like a mini-costco of just candy.
13322 I ended up going twice on Saturday.
13323 Love it!
13324 Seriously?!
13325 With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and even Safeway around here, I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire.
13326 1.
13327 It's wayyyy overpriced.
13328 I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price!
13329 We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example.
13330 The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here.
13331 Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.
13332 My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she "didn't have a register person" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again.
13333 Grrr.
13334 I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out.
13335 They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles).
13336 This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry.
13337 We went to Trader Joe's after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money.
13338 Sayin'.
13339 I love Coach.
13340 Stylish and trendy without spending an obscene amount of money on a bag.
13341 Sure they are still a bit more pricey than a purse at Target, but you are paying for name.
13342 The sales associates are really nice and won't hesitate talking to you.
13343 I only have a few things from Coach because usually I can't justify spending to much money to accessories, but anything you buy here you can use forever.
13344 A coach bag will probably never go out of style.
13345 Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends!
13346 Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged!
13347 Their beer recently passed Four Peaks as my favorite too, not an easy feat!
13348 If you're on the fence at all about checking this place out, do yourself a favor and just get yourself there!
13349 Humdinger!
13350 What more is there to say.
13351 It's the best sandwich ever.
13352 It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!
13353 If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town.
13354 I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.
13355 For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.
13356 It's probably not, but it tastes like it.
13357 And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.
13358 The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.
13359 But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.
13360 A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?
13361 Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M.
13362 Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like "health code violations" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.
13363 Lovely.
13364 And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit.
13365 He's been the top vote-getting General Dentist in Phoenix Magazine for three years in a row for a REASON, folks.
13366 He has an office in Chandler and in Mesa but even if you live in Minnesota, he's worth the drive.
13367 I have long been a fan of AJ's and lucky for me, they didn't open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California.
13368 If they had, I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother.
13369 The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done.
13370 The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter.
13371 It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced.
13372 I want that tea now, I think it was pineapple or something yummy.
13373 I perused around the store, picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter.
13374 I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay $4.99.
13375 Something inflation hadn't touched.I also picked up some huge honey crisp apples (something again Grandma can afford but won't buy for herself) and a small bunch of flowers for her.
13376 Next time I am in town, I am going to hit up AJ's right away for some iced tea!
13377 I went in once looking for Canidae.
13378 Which according to their website bold print they carry, but not the fine print.
13379 They don't carry it in all of their stores.
13380 My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day, I figured some food would be better than no food.
13381 During my visit I learned many things.
13382 Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.
13383 Innova is a far, far superior dog food.
13384 Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.
13385 Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.
13386 Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less.
13387 Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.
13388 But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.
13389 "You know you have the nibbles.
13390 Are you sure you want nibbles?
13391 We have bits if your dog prefers bits".
13392 She's a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.
13393 I mentioned that the nibbles were fine.
13394 "Are you sure you want nibbles?
13395 We have bits if you want bits"?
13396 Dude, just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here.
13397 As expected, my dog ate the nibbles.
13398 She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate.
13399 Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae.
13400 I love this place!
13401 it's a cultural experience!
13402 I think even if you are Mexican, this place delights all the senses!
13403 I love the tortilla department!
13404 36 freshly made yellow corn tortillas for $2.50!!
13405 !
13406 the ladies at the meat dept were fantastic!
13407 The wall of spices, herbs, and chilis was incredible.
13408 I did not have enough time to sit and eat there but that's the plan for the next trip.
13409 I came home and made shredded beef tacos with all the fixings.
13410 My rec is come and linger and enjoy the sights and then have a great lunch either at the food court or at the restaurant next door.
13411 *** I gave this 5 stars based on the best Mexican food I've had in AZ, not based on white linen and waiter service, just an fyi***
13412 I won't write too much as it seems that everyone already has.
13413 Both locations are GREAT.
13414 Some of the best "homestyle" Mexican I've ever had.
13415 I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven!
13416 A great place to call ahead on a friday night when you're exhausted from work and not doing jack, pick up your food, pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home.
13417 Happiness is a sure bet!
13418 I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.
13419 I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.
13420 Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.
13421 The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.
13422 The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.
13423 It looks terrible!!!
13424 They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.
13425 Now the thread just looked dirty.
13426 I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.
13427 They just kept saying in thick accent.
13428 "It's good, I fixed it good".
13429 They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.
13430 Just kept saying.
13431 "I fixed it good".
13432 Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place.
13433 pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear).
13434 overpriced fashion brands.
13435 if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.
13436 run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague.
13437 I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast "elites" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:)
13438 Why they let me play, I'll never know:)
13439 Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)
13440 It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a "Rodgering":)
13441 So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)
13442 Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)
13443 When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)
13444 After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than "regal" atmosphere:)
13445 They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun?
13446 :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)
13447 The smell in S&J can only be described as "extreme humanity"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly?
13448 :-)
13449 S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on "tap", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or "boofay" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.
13450 It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)
13451 S&J provided a table full of taco "fixin's"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting!
13452 :-(
13453 They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground "creature"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.
13454 I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, "beef"...just not very good "beef":(
13455 The hot tray holding the "meat" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of "meat" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(
13456 But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.
13457 I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(
13458 I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(
13459 One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not "broiled"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)
13460 Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(
13461 Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)
13462 Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).
13463 They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)
13464 Pop the Soda Shop has closed its doors last month.
13465 The "Cheers" of central Phoenix.
13466 We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago.
13467 As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple.
13468 The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book "excellent condition" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent.
13469 A fair price, and no hassle.
13470 At a car dealership.
13471 Who'd have thunk it?
13472 Welcome to Downtown!
13473 Finally a little area with a few great chains.
13474 They also have PARKING!
13475 The parking is located on the east or south side of the building.
13476 We grabbed Jersey Mike's on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat.
13477 They are the best subs we have had.
13478 They are packed with meat and cheese.
13479 Might be little pricier then blimpie, but with it due to the over load of meat!
13480  Check out a Jersey Mike's near you!
13481 Ok, these guys get five stars from me for many reasons.
13482 Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake.
13483 They were very courteous and helpful, although I ended up going with a cheaper option.
13484 Today, however, they definitely earned five stars.
13485 I was there for a meetup event.
13486 We got a tour of their facilities.
13487 The owner personally did the tour, and did a great job considering I brought my toddler, who screamed through about 75% of the tour.
13488 At the end, he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming.
13489 I know that some people think toddlers should be locked away so as not to annoy the general populous, but it's nice to know not everyone feels that way :)
13490 Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.
13491 The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent.
13492 You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!
13493 It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.
13494 I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others).
13495 Come on now, let's call a turd a turd on this one..
13496 Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them!
13497 However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd.
13498 Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco, words of advice.. Fucking eat something!
13499 This is the best Seafood restaurant I have ever eaten in.
13500 I have to say it is not my kind of place.
13501 Very Scottsdale.
13502 But Man they know how to cook.
13503 I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion.
13504 The Calamari was 1000 times better than any other I have had.
13505 I am not a big fan usually, but this was different.
13506 It was not fried but pan cooked and even people that didn't like Seafood tried it and loved it.
13507 The Wedge Salad was good.
13508 We shared the Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and Peas.
13509 I felt the sides were the only things that could stand some improvement.
13510 I had one of the tasty Mojitos and some Yummy Creme Brulee for desert.
13511 I am super glad this place is far away because I would want to go all the time.
13512 It is a bit pricy, but I felt it was worth it.
13513 The servers were really cool.
13514 Not uptight at all.
13515 The only thing I hated was they have rest room attendants.
13516 Maybe it is just me, but come on.
13517 I should not have to feel guilty for not tipping someone just for handing me a towel that I could have easily gotten for my self.
13518 I have little respect for businesses that do that.
13519 Hands down, the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to (and I am an avid world traveler).
13520 I've been riding this system on and off (I vaccilate between non-Phoenix-metro cities and here a lot) for roughly 10 years, and yeah, for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there, so I have a sound basis of comparison.
13521 This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations.
13522 Hell, in NYC and LA, it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated.
13523 Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other city-size comparable mass transit system that's out there.
13524 Get with the times!
13525 We need: busses that run MORE than once per 1/2 hour (and that's at it's current fastest), busses that are ON TIME (DAILY, they are never on time.
13526 Always way too early without waiting, or way too late without apology), more stops, stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind.
13527 I cannot even imagine how travelers get around on this thing, nothing is ever posted with any relevant info or signage.
13528 Etc, etc, etc.
13529 But seriously, just god awful and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transport anywhere else.
13530 Had a great experience.
13531 DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.
13532 Friendly staff.
13533 Prompt service.
13534 Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated.
13535 Very professional.
13536 awesome iconic eatery!
13537 whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint.
13538 yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system.
13539 it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought.
13540 i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors.
13541 love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.
13542 although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later!
13543 hands down one of my favorite eateries.
13544 i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!
13545 Love Sam's Club!
13546 Especially those little red velvet cupcakes and Chocolate wine ... the best!
13547 We always do most of our grocery shopping here.
13548 Always a treat.
13549 I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.
13550 The employees are courteous and the service is fast.
13551 The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.
13552 I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.
13553 I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.
13554 Don't do business at this unethical business.
13555 My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for "account inactivity" fees.
13556 They are a bunch of crooks.
13557 It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business.
13558 Account closed.
13559 Can't wait to go here again.
13560 Had the shrimp po-boy and some homemade banana pudding.
13561 I'll write more as I try different things on the menu, but what I did have was delicious.
13562 I love the urban feel of this place, and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me!
13563 The place is brand new, so not too many things are going on yet, but more stores are opening all the time!
13564 There's now a really high-end iPic movie theater, a frozen yogurt place, a great Nike store, and much more to come in addition to H&M, West Elm, and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co.
13565 Parking is fine and it's easy to navigate.
13566 When you're done here you can walk to Kierland across the street, too!
13567 :)
13568 Can't wait to see what they do here in a few years!
13569 The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night.
13570 We didn't arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable.
13571 After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita, we were left to enjoy our night of solitude.
13572 The room itself was beautiful; king sized bed, fireplace, patio overlooking the golf course, vanity, ipod dock, jetted tub, separate shower, and plush robes and slippers.
13573 We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly.
13574 The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic.
13575 For $13 the salad was a total miss.
13576 Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers thrown on a plate.
13577 I was hungry though, so it worked.
13578 The next morning we slept in as late as we could.
13579 I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks, balsamic!)
13580 so I called the front desk for some Tums.
13581 No problem, they arrived pronto.
13582 We packed up and called for a ride, and although they said they were busy, they arrived shortly after.
13583 I would love to come back here and stay a little longer.
13584 The service was great, the place was beautiful, and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect.
13585 If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.
13586 Fry's "dining style" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.
13587 The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place.
13588 It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more.
13589 I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun!
13590 Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try.
13591 Also, don't be afraid to speak up.
13592 I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention.
13593 Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like.
13594 They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor.
13595 I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing.
13596 I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo.
13597 I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor.
13598 They have the best home made ranch dressing here!
13599 Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor.
13600 OMG!
13601 Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit.
13602 Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant.
13603 My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12")...maybe someday soon.
13604 All sandwiches get toasted.
13605 Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top).
13606 Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit.
13607 Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too!
13608 If you're lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then!
13609 :-)
13610 Staff is nice, and that's it.
13611 They use very cheap tires that only last for a year.
13612 The customer service at this Macy's was seriously out of this world.
13613 Both my mom and I (who were visiting from out of town; me, San Diego and her, Baltimore) have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store, anywhere, EVER!
13614 We were there late at night- probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day.
13615 In every single dept.
13616 We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful.
13617 Most of our visit was in ladies dresses.
13618 Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size.
13619 Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking.
13620 We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful.
13621 The selection (at least in women's) was better than most other Macy's I've been to, to boot.
13622 I wish this was my local Macy's!
13623 Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)
13624 I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway.
13625 Why did i wait so long?
13626 !
13627 Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo.
13628 The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie.
13629 It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies.
13630 We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap.
13631 It is incredible.
13632 Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down.
13633 Very high-tech!
13634 The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it.
13635 Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful.
13636 This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!
13637 !
13638 This is where you want to go.
13639 I grew up at this library.
13640 And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.
13641 They have a great selection of audio books.
13642 I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be!
13643 Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.
13644 I dig this library.
13645 Terrible rolls.
13646 The Dragon was so so.
13647 The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food.
13648 Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible.
13649 Having just moved to Scottsdale, I had seen Four Peaks brews at local restaurants and couldn't wait to try it.
13650 My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo.
13651 The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours).
13652 We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area.
13653 The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.
13654 The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of.
13655 I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour.
13656 Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour).
13657 Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip.
13658 Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.
13659 Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth.
13660 The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of.
13661 Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home!
13662 Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew.
13663 $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge.
13664 Normal refills of growlers are $10.
13665 I am a beer lover.
13666 I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world.
13667 You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews.
13668 Next stop, North Scottsdale location.
13669 Closer to home and hopefully just as great!
13670 Love this place!
13671 Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail, everything is so good here.
13672 I also love the pork chop!
13673 My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy.
13674 The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.
13675 Everything else, not so much.
13676 My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!!
13677 Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!
13678 !
13679 This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything.
13680 The food here is light, simple, and fresh.
13681 We started out with the guacamole which was amazing.
13682 My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style.
13683 The salsa that came with it was the bomb.
13684 One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa.
13685 The green one was so good I wanted to drink it.
13686 I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans.
13687 Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal.
13688 We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing.
13689 It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had.
13690 Gallo Blanco is my new obsession.
13691 When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.
13692 (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).
13693 But now, alas.
13694 .
13695 .
13696 Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.
13697 Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.
13698 Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job.
13699 We have been taking our dogs to All-Star since they opened.
13700 The staff has always been great and remembers our girls by name, and the Vets are fantastic!
13701 Any Dr who will get down on the ground and love on my doggies is ok in my book.
13702 They have squeezed us in for emergency visits many times.
13703 We have also boarded our dogs here and they take awesome care of them.
13704 Just wish they were opened on the weekends
13705 My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box.
13706 I haven't seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and I'm no spring chicken).
13707 The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.
13708 The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD.
13709 The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.
13710 It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.
13711 The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.
13712 Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.
13713 Not with NGD.
13714 It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas.
13715 Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.
13716 He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly.
13717 We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD!
13718 Went here for the first time today.
13719 Loved it.
13720 Becca was fun/professional and did a great job.
13721 I have been looking for a place to get a "big boy haircut" since I moved in the area a few months ago, so far Canyon Falls has impressed me.
13722 Normally I just settle for whats cheap and quick from an $11 haircut place.
13723 Yes, I paid more for my cut at Canyon Falls... but it was worth it.
13724 The place is clean, the employees are clean, I was greeted right away when I came in and I left FEELING like I got a good cut.
13725 I was only in for a cut/shampoo so I cant comment on any of the other services they offer but,  I think I might have found a my new place to get my hair cut...at last.
13726 Thanks Becca.
13727 Great, fun atomosphere!
13728 Service was great!
13729 My wife and I had a wonderful date night here.
13730 The fillet was nicely cooked and the sides were just as good.
13731 Average prices but great value!
13732 Highly recommend this place for date night!
13733 Family friendly and we love the soups and salads.
13734 Mushroom soup is our favorite!!!!
13735 We also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious.
13736 Sunday brunch is great too.
13737 We do frittatas or banana pancakes, yum.
13738 Or a simple Wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick.
13739 We'be been going for years and will continue to go.
13740 Oh, did I mention the free WiFi?
13741 Great for some business lunches.
13742 I've played well over 40 of the Golf Magazine Top 100 courses in the US.
13743 We're lucky to have many of them here right in our backyard.
13744 This course stands out!
13745 Exemplary service, and the driving range is the best I've ever seen.
13746 The course is tough.
13747 No country club rolls here.
13748 Hit it right or left and you're undoubtedly taking a drop, and a stroke.
13749 Can't wait to get back for my next round!
13750 My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review.
13751 For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday.
13752 The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment.
13753 Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but.
13754 The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time.
13755 Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations.
13756 I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there.
13757 The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait.
13758 Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance.
13759 Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time.
13760 I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face.
13761 I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up.
13762 We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong.
13763 I load one item up and head back to Pita.
13764 Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much.
13765 As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong.
13766 As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken.
13767 One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads.
13768 Everything came with chicken.
13769 The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken.
13770 There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians.
13771 Sorry, try again.
13772 Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered.
13773 I declined.
13774 There is only so much wrong that baklava can right.
13775 Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me.
13776 Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer?
13777 Too bad the coupon expires in a few days.
13778 I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle.
13779 In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there.
13780 In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me.
13781 That's shameful.
13782 I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary.
13783 After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.
13784 To the food, we concur with almost everyone here.
13785 It was impeccable!
13786 We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented.
13787 Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high.
13788 They are all fresh.
13789 Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like.
13790 And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.
13791 For main course, I got Ivory Salmon "Oreganata", bf got Swordfish blackened.
13792 I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes "surpassed expectation."
13793 I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh.
13794 We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's.
13795 It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here.
13796 Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth.
13797 The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided.
13798 One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.
13799 Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas.
13800 I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home.
13801 But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there.
13802 I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks.
13803 It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes.
13804 It was big enough to share and take home.
13805 One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.
13806 Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink.
13807 We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews.
13808 Total worth it!!
13809 !
13810 The service was amazing.
13811 We had Robert.
13812 We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable.
13813 Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.
13814 We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate "Happy Anniversary" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate.
13815 The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other.
13816 The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud.
13817 Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room.
13818 And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of "expense account" people though
13819 I have had chicken.
13820 I have had waffles.
13821 And now, I've had chicken AND waffles.
13822 Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction.
13823 Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination.
13824 Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.
13825 Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters.
13826 It's not a place for any pretentious behavior.
13827 The place has "Chicken & Waffles" in the name, OK?
13828 And that's what you're going to get.
13829 In abundance.
13830 Cheap as hell.
13831 I had the #1, also known as KK's.
13832 Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg.
13833 All battered and fried to perfection.
13834 Two waffles the size of Vermont.
13835 A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side.
13836 OK, I could have done without the last part.
13837 But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...
13838 I'm still full.
13839 I won't eat dinner tonight.
13840 I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss.
13841 And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.
13842 Damn.
13843 Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine.
13844 Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant.
13845 Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age.
13846 Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with "it's just how we do things" and "there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little".
13847 The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner "really doesn't care".
13848 Hubris is so unappetizing.
13849 I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere.
13850 LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!
13851 During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.
13852 Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.
13853 I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.
13854 I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet.
13855 First, I'd like to send a shout-out to Irma, our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry.
13856 Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe.
13857 Way to go Irma!
13858 We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails.
13859 We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table.
13860 Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria.
13861 Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.
13862 The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie "The Bird Cage" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue.
13863 Bummer!
13864 Now on to the Paella.
13865 It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice.
13866 This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so.
13867 This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it.
13868 We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos.
13869 So if you are in the mood for something different, fun, and oh so delicioso, I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe.
13870 I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma.
13871 REAL NY STYLE CHINESE FOOD HERE IN ARIZONA!!
13872 !
13873 FREE HOT TEA AND FRIED WON-TON SKINS LIKE BACK HOME!
13874 (BY REQUEST)
13875 I am from New Jersey and so are the owners.
13876 They opened up shop here 1 year after I moved here (1998) and I was delighted i could get a real NY egg-roll and spare ribs in Arizona.
13877 Their best dish i feel is the Szechuan Garlic Chicken (or shrimp).
13878 Try it once and you may never try anything else on the menu it's that good!!
13879 Taste's the same as the best of NYC.
13880 Their lunch specials are amazing.
13881 Comes with soup, spring roll, crab puff, fried rice, hot tea (by request) all for a very low price.
13882 Sunday is Dim Sum if you like dumplings.
13883 This place NEVER disappoints and I bring work clients here from New York all the time.
13884 they all agree, REAL NY CHINESE FOOD!!!
13885 !
13886 This is a great place to shop, grab a bite, eat dessert, relax, or just hang around.
13887 Eat at one of the many excellent restaurants like Christopher's, Seasons 52, Black Chili Mexican, and Capitol Grill.
13888 Swing by Royal for a cappuccino, iced latte, or your favorite coffee of the day.
13889 Savor frozen delight from Haagen Dazs or Mojo Yogurt -- ahhh my sweet Mojo, you and I have been in an on and off relationship for the past year now... by off I mean the 3 or 4 days a week I'm NOT there :)  .
13890 Movies in the park nights are fun to go to; gasping, laughing, and crying with 200 of your closest (people you probably just met).
13891 Get there early for good seats, (about 30 min or more), otherwise you'll be stuck behind a tree or some tall guy you can't see around.
13892 Be sure to bring a lawn chair along or a blanket to throw down if you'll be attending one of these events.
13893 The shopping is top notch - but be sure to bring your wallet.
13894 Most shops here will cost you at least your first born child, or an equivalent value.
13895 Happy shopping to all my yelping buddies!
13896 Best ribs in Arizona (besides my own)!
13897 !
13898 We've been going here for years.
13899 Love the food (Happy Family is a favorite dish) and appreciate the community service outreach.
13900 Great to support locals who support the community ... and dish up great food along the way.
13901 Loved it.
13902 Pulled pork & pulled chicken, bbq sauce & the cole slaw were ALL outstanding.
13903 ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway.
13904 It is in the shopping center with CVS & Circle K.
13905 Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood.
13906 Citizen is versatile -- the perfect place for a romantic date, a small gathering, or for just meeting a buddy for a drink.
13907 A place with a great vibe.
13908 My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality.
13909 Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter.
13910 Every employee is attentive to every table.
13911 Our server was gregarious, accommodating, gracious, and highly proactive.
13912 We definitely felt the 'warm and fuzzy' atmosphere.
13913 They pay attention to the little things -- such as house-made ketchup for your french fries.
13914 The food: about as good as upscale bar food is going to get.
13915 For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes.
13916 Portions weren't large, but very high quality.
13917 The calamari was flash-fried and not greasy, and seemed very fresh.
13918 For my entree I had the wagyu burger, which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun.
13919 Overall impression: Citizen will have staying power, unlike many establishments that open in Old Town.
13920 The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff, equip the place with great staff, and don't go overboard with prices.
13921 I'm looking forward to returning!
13922 While Calabria Italian Kitchen & Deli is at this location the Grocery portion has been CLOSED.
13923 Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food.
13924 Could not have been more impressed.
13925 Food was amazing.
13926 Far above expectations.
13927 The torta was huge and delicious.
13928 Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price!
13929 My mother and I were actually getting out of the car to go to Streets of New York next door when she smelled the Mexican food and suggested we try Roberto's instead.
13930 That should tell you what you need to know right there.
13931 It's a hole in the wall place for sure, and leaves much to be desired visually, but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean.
13932 If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't your place.
13933 At $7-$10 for an entree, though, it was delicious.
13934 Beans, rice, and chips were pretty standard, but the salsa, fish taco, and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful.
13935 The food tastes homemade, and in this case, that's a good thing.
13936 This place was also featured on TLC's Diners and Drive-ins show back in the day.
13937 One of Anthem's best kept secrets.
13938 I'll be back!
13939 I have been eating here since high school, so i can safley say bout 35 years.
13940 The food is still as good as it was when 15 of us would jump into Smitty's vw van and drive down for our 30 minuet lunch break.
13941 (West high of course) It has been owned by the same family since it opened in the early 1800's!!!
13942 Yes the cheese crisp are awesome but the tacos not the shredded beef but the regular tacos are the best in town.
13943 Order a couple they are sooo good.
13944 Love you Los.
13945 I LOVE DIlly's!
13946 I always get the Dilly Club and Chicken Noodle Soup, which comes with a bread bowl that is oh so yummy!
13947 Creative Healing Solutions is a fantastic naturopathic doctors office.
13948 I'm so grateful that I found this place and met Dr. Roxie Strand and her wonderful assistant, Melissa.
13949 My life has changed so much for the better since April 2012 when I walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts.
13950 Dr. Roxie was attentive and thorough, and suggested I consider HCG.
13951 I had never heard of it before then, so I went home and did my research.
13952 I was a little nervous, but never felt any pressure and when I decided to give it a try, I felt very at ease being under her supervision.
13953 Now, I'm 85 lbs lighter and feel better than I have in years.
13954 I could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program, office and Dr. Strand are, but I simply suggest that you consider visiting Dr. Roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you haven't been able to solve before.
13955 She does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you.
13956 I never thought I could totally change my lifestyle, but Dr. Roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey, which I appreciate so much!
13957 Whether you are in need of a weight loss solution or need someone to help with other medical matters, I fully recommend Dr. Strand.
13958 After spending a combined seven years as a graduate student at ASU, imagine my dissapointment when I came to discover that there was finally decent Asian food walking distance from campus... two months after my departure for internship in San Diego.
13959 Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food (variety, flavor, price) with what I like about a modern, trendy restaurant (good decor, modern music, attentive servers).
13960 Though everything on the menu is above average, one item really stands out; cha gio cream cheese.
13961 I believe at this location it's called tiger rolls.
13962 Completely inauthentic, and I couldn't care less.
13963 DAMN they're good.
13964 When I drive in from San Diego, I often head there on my first night in town, occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area, before stopping off to drop off my bags.
13965 Honestly one of the best things I've tasted anywhere.
13966 Highly highly recommend.
13967 I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious!
13968 Cannot wait to go back gain.
13969 OOOOOWWWEEEE!!
13970 Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!!
13971 If not what are you waiting for!
13972 They are the BOMB Diggity!
13973 I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go!
13974 The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!
13975 Holy Crap!!
13976 Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!!
13977 The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!
13978 !
13979 Luv me some wings from ATL!
13980 Wow this place is great.
13981 The whole atmosphere is unique.
13982 Bowling, bars, dj - it's an awesome idea.
13983 Only thing is on a Friday, it's super busy and takes along time to get a bowling lane.
13984 Perfect hotel for my conference travel needs.
13985 Clean, new, great bars, close to other food options across the street, super friendly staff.
13986 Great business traveler property.
13987 The bed was SOOO comfortable.
13988 Sometimes, Starwood beds can be too soft, but this was just right.
13989 Access to the convention center is so convenient.
13990 Just out the door and down a block and a half.
13991 Can't beat that in the heat!
13992 Duane is amazing!
13993 Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply can't reccomend him enough!
13994 I've used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.
13995 I won't call anyone else!
13996 This place seems to get better every time I visit.
13997 The first time was a Friday night out with the guys.
13998 We met up for dinner and I had (and loved) the pulled pork and sweet potato fries.
13999 After dinne we got our drink on with a live band.
14000 The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors.
14001 And the shots kept on coming!
14002 It was a blast.
14003 The second time was more laid back, just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend.
14004 It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy.
14005 The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing.
14006 It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar!
14007 We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there.
14008 Awesome night!
14009 Amazing place.
14010 I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies.
14011 Delicious great service!
14012 Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize!
14013 Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.
14014 Our server was very quick and attentive.
14015 The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.
14016 *  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.
14017 I left totally stuffed and happy.
14018 One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that.
14019 My house is clean using pet-friendly products.
14020 They arrive on time.
14021 I know that some of the reviews talk about having trouble reaching them by phone, but I have never had a problem reaching them by email (which I prefer).
14022 The ladies show up, work quickly and efficiently, and are on their way.
14023 I couldn't be happier.
14024 Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks!
14025 My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed a place for dinner.
14026 Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks (a Vikings bar) on our way back home to Minnesota.
14027 My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler.
14028 Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!
14029 I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.
14030 For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.
14031 The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.
14032 I think it was the beer batter.
14033 My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.
14034 I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!
14035 The atmosphere was also great.
14036 It was very laid back and fun to be able to sit amongst the beer being made.
14037 I highly recommend Four Peaks whether you are a Phoenix native or otherwise!
14038 Ever since I was diagnosed with a Gluten intolerance, Chipotle's yummy burrito bowl has been my constant companion.
14039 The barbacoa is seasoned well and works even better with a kick of the Chipote Tabassco sauce!
14040 I have been going to Arizona Auto Care since about 2002 when I worked in the same complex.
14041 I have since worked all around the valley and moved out of state and back and I have always only taken my vehicles there for service!
14042 They are honest and professional and always take excellent care of my vehicles.
14043 Jeff is one of the owners and a Subaru master tech and has worked on countless Subaru's for me, friends and family!
14044 Jeff and team will give you honest and sound advice when fixing your car and not try to oversell you just to make up sales and quotas like the stealerships.
14045 Thanks again Jeff, Chris & guys at AZ Auto Care for years of great service and to many more!
14046 MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!
14047 !
14048 Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town.
14049 I love the salsa bar.
14050 The wait staff has always been nice.
14051 The prices of  food and drink are great.
14052 This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks.
14053  The patio area is nice all year round.
14054 Went back, they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced.
14055 Food, atmosphere, everything still wonderful.
14056 In my first review, I stated "the only reason I'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level."
14057 As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this.
14058 Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.
14059 I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.
14060 I honestly did not expect for any type of response.
14061 Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon.
14062 Re: Another reviewer's issue with "soggy fried calamari"
14063 It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.
14064 I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.
14065 Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.
14066 Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two.
14067 I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House -- Oh, loved the recent press on the Chef's high praise, it *is* well deserved!
14068 I can't believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday.
14069 Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out.
14070 It is that good.
14071 They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning.
14072 He picks 2 unique dishes.
14073 It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted.
14074 I crave it all the time.
14075 I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top.
14076 I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am).
14077 You just have to go check it out.
14078 I am going TONIGHT!
14079 I've brought my dogs here and met with both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful.
14080 Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldn't go anywhere else.
14081 This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably haven't found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove.
14082 Ashamedly, even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers, we called Pecan Grove and Dr. Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone.
14083 While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer.
14084 Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldn't go anywhere else (had I not moved across the country)
14085 One of the few legit brewpubs around.
14086 Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low.
14087 Andrew, the manager, reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here.
14088 Insulting to assume.
14089 Not recommended!!!
14090 !
14091 Agree with the previous review.
14092 Something nice about this super target.
14093 Leaving a review to back up the other!
14094 !
14095 My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer.
14096 Or my wife does anyway!!
14097 !
14098 burger heaven!
14099 I had THE PIG Burger... it.
14100 was.
14101 delicious.
14102 and it was served on a pretzel roll.
14103 mmmmmm
14104 Good vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.
14105 I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.
14106 i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??)
14107 and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment.
14108 The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.
14109 I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.
14110 It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.
14111 Local beers on tap, good price too.
14112 Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time.
14113 Nothing to worry about.
14114 That's how you learn!
14115 !
14116 We only come here for the water and in that regard there are no complaints about this place.
14117 There is no chlorine smell, faucets are all fast and the guys find your water card fast.
14118 My picks:
14119 Derby Smash
14120 Green Chili Risotto
14121 Pan Seared Escolar
14122 Sticky Buns
14123 If you are looking for Arizona charm, this is the place.
14124 Every Arizona resident needs to experience this hidden gem.
14125 Thanks Jacquie, Kristy & Tim for continuing to believe in this historic restaurant and landmark!
14126 We went today after lunch.
14127 I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot.
14128 Best ice cream in Phoenix!
14129 The staff is always super nice.
14130 They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place
14131 Awesome!!
14132 !
14133 Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental.
14134 Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful.
14135 Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough.
14136 I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning.
14137 I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me.
14138 I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done.
14139 This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...
14140 I love Yasu!!
14141 This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.
14142 I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.
14143 You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good
14144 Nigiri/sashimi are a must.
14145 They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!
14146 The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.
14147 Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!
14148 Love this place!
14149 !
14150 Went here earlier this spring and WOW - What a way to watch spring training
14151 I LOVE the Giants stadium, and this is much better.
14152 It has twice as much lawn seating, the seats are wide and comfortable AND - aimed towards home plate, which didn't used to seem like a big deal but sitting in Scottsdale down the line, IT IS.
14153 The food there is top notch, with an amazing pizza slice
14154 Plus, the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing - it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate, I think every team should do such a joint complex.
14155 They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods.
14156 They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter.
14157 Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help.
14158 I absolutely love the food here!
14159 the service is good, the food is excellent and as far as the price goes..I can't complain.
14160 this is one of favorite places to eat.
14161 My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat.
14162 We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new).
14163 They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning.
14164 They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable.
14165 Absolutely great service!
14166 I highly recommend them.
14167 This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in this area of town.
14168 I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed.
14169 If you're looking for an amazing location/view/atmosphere, this probably isn't the place for you.
14170 If you're looking for amazing food, then you've come to the right place.
14171 The prices are great for what you get.
14172 The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite!
14173 Fantastic venue!
14174 Province really adds a touch of class and elegance in a way that isn't pushy or over the top.
14175 Located in the Westin Hotel, the restaurant feels very modern!
14176 You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature.
14177 The food was unbelievable!
14178 I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love - what an amazing combination that I'd never have thought of.
14179 If the food isn't enough, the service is superb.
14180 Every interaction with the staff was excellent - you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there.
14181 I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible.
14182 I took a road trip with the fellas to watch the LA Kings beat the Phoenix Coyotes @ the Jobing.com Arena and I must say our experience at this hotel far exceeded expectations!
14183 Not only was the hotel suite very affordable when split between 4 guys (3 queen beds and 1 roll away all in 1 suite at no extra charge!
14184 ), but the room was very nice, included a small refrigerator and microwave and was very comfortable!
14185 Very new and modern and all we had to do was walk across the street to the whole Westgate Center/bars/restaurants/arena which was a HUGE plus!
14186 At the end of a drunken debauchery filled night we stumbled back (a 5 minute walk) to our hotel safely!
14187 We were going to stay a few miles away to save money but read some reviews about the hotels having "bed bugs" and being dirty.
14188 You won't have that problem staying here!
14189 The room was immaculate and the staff were beyond friendly and accommodating!
14190 That was probably the best part:  Friendly staff!
14191 The staff literally gave off a small town feel, the only time I've ever been treated better was at a bed and breakfast!
14192 And  the morning breakfast was another thing that made this hotel worth it.
14193 After drinking all night and being hung over, all we needed to do was stumble down to the lobby to get some eggs, sausage, ham, toast, bagels, waffles, apple and orange juice and we were re-fueled up for some more debauchery!
14194 They had something for everyone, including a variety of cereals and  whatever you can think of for breakfast free of charge!
14195 So if you're planning on staying anywhere near the Westgate center/Phoenix stadium/Jobing.com arena this is the place to stay!
14196 We will definitely be staying here again the next time I'm out in AZ for a game!
14197 Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isn't Denny's or iHop in Gilbert.
14198 Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus.
14199 The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING!
14200 Probably the highlight of the meal.
14201 We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?
14202 ), a slice of red velvet cake.
14203 We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the 'Rents.
14204 This place has negra modelo on tap.
14205 I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that.
14206 The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.
14207 Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.
14208 I mean that in a good way.
14209 We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.
14210 Everyone loves it.
14211 I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!
14212 I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery...
14213 I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.
14214 Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.
14215 I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!
14216 Everything was delicious!
14217 It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.
14218 I had the "Godfather" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun-
14219 dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).
14220 I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!
14221 Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy...
14222 I'll be back to visit soon!
14223 I personally like this Fry's.
14224 I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly.
14225 I go there once or twice a week and I'm always greeted with a smile.
14226 A few of them even ask me where I've been if I haven't been in for awhile and ask me how I'm doing.
14227 Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesn't make sense to me since that means people like shopping there.
14228 They have no control of it being crowded.
14229 If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there.
14230 Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better.
14231 Why is it so busy?
14232 Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there.
14233 It's a positive thing.
14234 You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off.
14235 You have options.
14236 love love love this place for a second i don't feel like i'm in fakville anymore.
14237 Live music and a diverse crowd.
14238 They make a great infused berry tea smoothie no dairy just juice and ice!
14239 Parking is great and the selection of food is appropriate and divine for a cafe.
14240 Very comfortable and not to image conscious inside!
14241 Love that it's independent and staff is so lovely.
14242 I would pay $10 for a latte just to support them!
14243 Punch card too!
14244 I absolutely love this place!
14245 I've had my birthday here twice in the last 5 years, and they have been able to accommodate large groups (up to 20s).
14246 Their patio is super cute and great in the fall and spring time.
14247 My favorite pizza is the Di Notte.
14248 Cute atmosphere combined with good food = one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.
14249 Worth the drive to downtown!
14250 A hipster shindig- for day and night- make your meal with THE Burger au Poivre, Cobb Salad and best made cocktails around... One of the best places for brunch!
14251 I had been wanting to come back for a while.
14252 I love this restaurant.
14253 Last night we had a magnificent meal.
14254 I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.
14255 There are so many wonderful choices.
14256 They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it "a la carte", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.
14257 It was delicious.
14258 I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.
14259 I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.
14260 WOW, they were so sweet and tender.
14261 They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.
14262 The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.
14263 I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).
14264 I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.
14265 I had a bite of his and it was great.
14266 I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.
14267 I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.
14268 It is such a great place.
14269 Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012.
14270 Therefore we were near to Abuelo's for lunch.
14271 Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good!
14272 We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP.
14273 We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole.
14274 Nice way to start off lunch!
14275 My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special.
14276 Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful!
14277 Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear.
14278 Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service.
14279 Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service!
14280 Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day.
14281 We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!
14282 Have you ever eaten somewhere and just can't get the craving out of your head and you have to go back!
14283 This is the place that does it to me.
14284 I've decided I need to try everything on their menu!
14285 You have to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing it is to DIE for!
14286 And the mac 'n cheese  so yummy.
14287 I've also had the Prosciutto and Fig Jam sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
14288 I had that with fruit which was good.
14289 Guess where I'm going for lunch... yeah there because I need it after doing this review.
14290 :-)
14291 Oh and before I forget...
14292 When the weather is nice sit out side!
14293 You will love it.
14294 The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas.
14295 The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced.
14296 Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order.
14297 I love this place!
14298 Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out!
14299 (just let them know if you're in a  hurry)
14300 P.S.
14301 The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)
14302 The first time I went to YC's was in scottsdale.
14303 I loved how you choose what you like in your bowl and sauces.
14304 they cook it up right in front of you.
14305 you can stuff your bowl as much as you can.
14306 don't worry about getting alot because all you pay for a take out box is 50 cents.
14307 it is great for leftovers, the food tastes fresh still.
14308 The one in tempe was awesome as well.
14309 I love this place.
14310 I had one larg bowl, a bowl of rice, chicken soup, and a soda for $10.25 how can you go wrong with that??
14311 ?
14312 Just go eat here.
14313 Get the cheese curds, I think they may be developing CCA (cheese curd anonymous) soon, but until it becomes a diagnosable disease I will continue to indulge.
14314 Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies.
14315 Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix.
14316 Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out.
14317 And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits.
14318 When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.
14319 The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.
14320 Defalco's was one of them.
14321 But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.
14322 What a fool I was.
14323 This place is fantastic!
14324 First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.
14325 Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.
14326 It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.
14327 So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.
14328 Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.
14329 My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.
14330 Simple, yet perfection.
14331 I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.
14332 Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.
14333 It's always about the bread for me.
14334 Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.
14335 One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.
14336 It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.
14337 I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!
14338 Yo, this is my favorite AJ's here.
14339 If you gots a beef with the prices then go somewhere else.
14340 Actually, the prices aren't any higher than Safeway, they just carry better, and more expensive for them to buy, products.
14341 They have been great to me as far as ordering Rambutans when I have a whim or a craving.
14342 The sandwich counter is awesome, and I love the slices of pizza that are as big as my head.
14343 The drink counter is stellar and they brew China Mist iced teas.
14344 Every once in a while the Prickly Pear flavor comes up and I'm so so so happy.
14345 This store is much larger than the Scottsdale/Lincoln location, and the service here is friendlier than that location as well.
14346 Shot out to Gerri at the floral counter, she is teriffic, as well as the produce manager who takes care of me every time.
14347 You guys rock!
14348 Camus is a cute little trendy bar/restaurant located in the Clarendon hotel.
14349 I came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it.
14350 We were one of two tables though, so service was top notch.
14351 Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had.
14352 The chef even came out to say a hello, which I found to be impressive.
14353 The calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing.
14354 I definitely recommend this place!
14355 Great service
14356 Looking a cutting edge, wanting the best for everyone type of pet boutique you must go to Oliver and Annie's.
14357 Chris, the owner is amazing!
14358 He knows his stuff and has the best of the best.
14359 There is no pet boutique like his.
14360 Urban chic and healthy top draw.
14361 He is an amazing supporter of local artists and designers and an absolute delight to know and do business with.
14362 His loving nature is endearing!
14363 It's no surprise he just received the "Best of Phoenix" award.
14364 Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here?
14365 They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead.
14366 Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken.
14367 Have I told you how amazing this spread is.
14368 If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls.
14369 Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook.
14370 Heck if you don't want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating.
14371 You will not be disappointed.
14372 I was thrilled to find my room huge, sheets crisp and clean, and the staff super friendly.
14373 I dined in Sol this past week and was amazed.
14374 I am in the industry and have absolutely fell in love with this place.
14375 The food is not only original but good an healthy.
14376 I will say this though if you are looking for refried beans and mush on your plate this is not the mexican food for you.
14377 It reminded me of time i have spent down the coast of mexico, very wonderful.
14378 I can see them still working out a few errors but they are very quick to fix any mistake.
14379 the service i had was absolutely amazing, it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me.
14380 he was funny and kept my table laughing and very informative overall, i really had a sense during my meal he wanted nothing but the best for my table.
14381 definitely somewhere i will be back too for sure, especially since im craving that taco vampiro again.
14382 Here's how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way:
14383 1.
14384 Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line.
14385 Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food.
14386 2.
14387 At 4:00, the bar opens.
14388 Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes you'll spend just waiting to get on the seating list.
14389 3.
14390 Order a few appetizers from the bar; they're light and fresh and yummy.
14391 4.
14392 When you finally get seated for dinner, don't hold back.
14393 Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after.
14394 The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait.
14395 We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line.
14396 Best pizza I've had since Italy.
14397 Bravo Bianco!
14398 Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent.
14399 It therefore deserves five stars!
14400 We were so disappointed!
14401 We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.
14402 It was nothing like the one we have had home.
14403 Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.
14404 I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.
14405 The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.
14406 We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.
14407 Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.
14408 The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.
14409 This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.
14410 :(
14411 If its good enough for Britney, its good enough for me.
14412 Which I guess isnt saying much these days...
14413 But trashy ole Brit knew what she was doing when she booked a room at Sanctuary.
14414 This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot.
14415 Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which I've heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there.
14416 I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc.
14417 We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us.
14418 Now thats service.
14419 Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets.
14420 Loveitloveit.
14421 At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort.
14422 It deserves its own review so I'll write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing.
14423 A great date spot for even those who aren't spending the night at the hotel.
14424 gotta be honest, i'm not a wine drinker, but came here to meet up with friends for a tasting.
14425 the space is sleek, yet cozy.
14426 the staff is friendly and very earnest and knowledgable in their wine presentation.
14427 This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants!
14428 They carry the best bran muffin I've ever had....it has a delicious brown sugar topping on it.
14429 I love coming here on special occasions!
14430 beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?
14431 really.
14432 The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?
14433 When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  "oh, is this your 1st time?
14434 we can remove it from the bill"
14435 I said forget it, keep it.
14436 i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.
14437   yeah, really worth losing a customer for?
14438 my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.
14439 gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)
14440 $2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.
14441 as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)
14442 so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?
14443 it's the chinese way i guess
14444 back to china king for us.
14445 sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.
14446 will you forgive us?
14447 haha
14448 Updating my review after several weeks.
14449 Appears maybe the managers read these reviews.
14450 In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars.
14451 The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits.
14452 Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.
14453 This is a true gem!
14454 I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him.
14455 I read the reviews and gave this place a try.
14456 I was really happy with the customer service, the service performed on my dog, the fact I got a same day appt, and most importantly....my dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable.
14457 He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself, but he seemed to be at complete ease here!
14458 We had looked to buy a unit here & looked at several units, then decided to rent for a while first.
14459 We've been here almost a year & loved it at first, but have had horrible noise problems for about 8 months & management won't do a thing about it.
14460 The walls here are paper-thin & we our neighbor plays her music loudly at 3am almost every night.
14461 It's so loud that we had to move our bed to the other side of the room and run a humidifier all night just to try to block the noise, but that doesn't work.
14462 We've called security several times, but it never seems to help.
14463 The ceilings are also very thin & you can easiy hear any walking above you.
14464 Aesthetically this place looks great.
14465 The gym is great too, but the construction is horrible.
14466 Both of my girls have been enrolled in Marilyn's studio and it has been a wonderful experience for our family.
14467 The teachers are engaging and creative and as a result both of my girls love to dance and my eldest daughter who is now 11 has been dancing with them since the age of 3.
14468 No stage moms here, but rather a warm, friendly environment where girls can develop their dance abilities free from the high pressure nature of some studios.
14469 Our family looks forward to many more recitals to come.
14470 Thanks Marilyn Bostic Ballet Centre for helping develop our daughters' confidence and love for dance!
14471 I live down the street from Casey Moore's.
14472 I have been here a total of three times.
14473 The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back.
14474 The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich.
14475 Again, it was so awful I had to send it back.
14476 I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out.
14477 There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back.
14478 So, this place was already two for two.
14479 Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more.
14480 He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot.
14481 It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'.
14482 This time, the food was decent.
14483 Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service.
14484 But the service was HORRIBLE.
14485 Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes.
14486 We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple "I'll be back with your orders."
14487 When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology.
14488 I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us.
14489 She was very monotone and never smiled with us.
14490 I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them.
14491 It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past.
14492 But no.
14493 This was our first time meeting her.
14494 We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service.
14495 We were polite and left a good tip.
14496 We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often.
14497 But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry.
14498 We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars...
14499 It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back.
14500 And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied.
14501 Sigh...
14502 Chai is alive and well, and living at City Center at City North.
14503 I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years.
14504 She was a plain gal, generic if you will.
14505 She was dependable and available.
14506 I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine.
14507 So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean.
14508 Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities.
14509 I needed more out of my relationships.
14510 They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear.
14511 Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press.
14512 I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time.
14513 I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.
14514 I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go.
14515 At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a "Dirty Chai."
14516 This was a Chai with espresso shots.
14517 Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms.
14518 I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.
14519 I opted for that.
14520 I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined.
14521 Press occupies a well appointed space, too.
14522 From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall.
14523 The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion.
14524 Press goes as far as to have a "dog friendly" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area.
14525 I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.
14526 In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.
14527 Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area.
14528 By the way, Press serves sandwiches and soups, as well as an extensive list of wines.
14529 Check it out, the staff will make you feel at home, or like you're on vacation in the cozy European city of your choice.
14530 I am a huge tea drinker, so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.
14531 I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea.
14532 After sampling several different blends, I chose three to purchase.
14533 The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked.
14534 Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister, I said "sure."
14535 He chatted as he filled the containers, never mentioning the price, and once done took my debit card and rang me up.
14536 I didn't pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped.
14537 I spent $350 on tea.
14538 I returned it and they didn't give me too much trouble.
14539 Now I always check the total before handing my card over, and I won't go back.
14540 I feel like they totally swindled me.
14541 Umm is it possible to give MORE than 5 stars!??!
14542 My girlfriend believes, Duane is AMAZING, and hands DOWN the best handyman ever.
14543 We stumbled upon him and had him come to the house to fix a ceiling fan that had fallen out of the ceiling completely.
14544 Yikes... His charge was reasonable for coming by about $40ish and he really goes above and beyond especially with quality and letting you know the facts.
14545 This was a house full of girls and often times when they are clueless they try to pull a fast one, NOPE, not Duane.
14546 He is honest, and very caring.
14547 When he was leaving he noticed the door had a stick to it and brought back something from his vehicle and fixed it for free!
14548 Most recently, my girlfriend called him at nearly 9pm to tell him her disposal stopped working.
14549 He immediately remembered her as the house with the three dental students and exactly where she lived (even though he had last been there a year ago) and walked her through how to fix it over the phone, for free.
14550 This guy really is the epitome of what everyone wants and needs in a handyman!
14551 Call him for ANY home issue you may need help with!
14552 I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer.
14553 For free!
14554 It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldn't have been friendlier.
14555 There were even snacks.
14556 I also had another sample of their Camelback ale.
14557 Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup.
14558 The tour was fun and informative.
14559 The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!!
14560 We didn't bring our bikes.
14561 So awesome.
14562 Definitely recommend.
14563 Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon.
14564 One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old.
14565 Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not.
14566 They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun.
14567 Other than that this place is amazing.
14568 I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time I came to sit and study.
14569 Man, am I a fan of this place.
14570 I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here.
14571 The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me.
14572 I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on.
14573 That added to the peace and quiet of it.
14574 Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7).
14575 I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say).
14576 They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool.
14577 I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX.
14578 There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee.
14579 Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable.
14580 I can purchase any supplies needed, heck--they will even fill out the forms!
14581 I come bring all my packages here, ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing.
14582 While I hate dealing with shipping things... this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in.
14583 We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees.
14584 We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner.
14585 Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service.
14586 Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance.
14587 Not good Gordon B.
14588 Not good.
14589 I came in for a gift for my boyfriend's pleasure.
14590 The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.
14591 Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.
14592 I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.
14593 Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.
14594 This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.
14595 I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!
14596 Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on "girls night out" it can be very affordable.
14597 The atmosphere and the "specialness" of the melting pot is unbeatable.
14598 I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays.
14599 Food is wonder, especially the cheese!
14600 The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion
14601 A must for us when we visit Scottsdale.
14602 Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic.
14603 Very well priced and easy to bring the family, have some wings, burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank.
14604 Love this place!
14605 I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here!
14606 They serve quality gourmet food.
14607 And they have a full bar too.
14608 Place is clean and service is great.
14609 Would go back anytime!
14610 Great service, good beer, AMAZING burger and yummy sweet potato fries.
14611 This place is an awesome bar food venue with a cool interior design, not too pricey or pretentious.
14612 I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet.
14613 Several months (maybe over a year?)
14614 ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one.
14615 I was skeptical (as is my nature).
14616 It can't be that much better right?
14617 You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right?
14618 Well, maybe.
14619 But I love this place.
14620 And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover.
14621 They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast.
14622 Never bitter, never oily, never yucky.
14623 The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best.
14624 But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home.
14625 Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold.
14626 Can't wait to try out the downtown location.
14627 Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service.
14628 I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing!
14629 The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste.
14630 The portions were a good amount for their low prices.
14631 I couldn't  get enough of their amazing dessert!
14632 Had to update because we've now tried the pizza!
14633 For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...)
14634 We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat).
14635 We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed!
14636 It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly!
14637 Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time!
14638 We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.
14639 It was fantastic!
14640 This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share.
14641 Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!
14642 A big shout out to Mike, the stupendously stellar bar manager.
14643 I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka.
14644 Thank you to restaurant GM, Anibal, who stopped by to see us not once, but twice.
14645 Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles.
14646 Aaron, the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier, had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette.
14647 Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose, Sam,  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events.
14648 Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks, and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from.
14649 Thanks again everyone: you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which (to say the least) did not go well, into a very enjoyable and fun evening.
14650 Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur.
14651 This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People.
14652 Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is.
14653 $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant.
14654 The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping.
14655 They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers.
14656 They dont have.
14657 If you like spicy, skip it for sure.
14658 Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand.
14659 Tiny servings.
14660 The good.
14661 Friendly wait staff.
14662 If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill.
14663 I'm very new to PHX.
14664 I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze.
14665 I had to check it out.
14666 My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed.
14667 The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing.
14668 The bathroom was great!
14669 They don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want.
14670 We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish.
14671 Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11.
14672 I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though.
14673 I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can.
14674 Finally, well-qualified, well-established mechanics that don't talk to me like I'm a dumb, car-ignorant girl - even if I am.
14675 I was sitting at a desk establishing an estimate for my Honda within 20 minutes of calling them.
14676 The receptionist was polite and efficient, but truly the best part was their interactive, transparent estimate process.
14677 I was able to view the screen as my estimator drag and dropped the parts he suspected I would need into a spreadsheet.
14678 Then, I saw him calculate the labor hours - something I had NEVER been privy to before.
14679 Tracy's Auto Body was affordable, very quick and went above and beyond - alerting me to other pieces that were loose and fixing them for free.
14680 I highly recommended their services.
14681 They have a perfect record since the mid-1980s with BBB and with good reason.
14682 So I was like a lemming trying this after Man vs Food when recently visiting Phoenix.
14683 But......  the kid is right.... everything on the Del Rey torta works together.
14684 And it is HUGE.
14685 And it's great too.
14686 Wonderfully constructed, just enough of everything and not too much of anything.
14687 I also had the watermelon juice (interesting, huh)?
14688 One strange thing.... first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in that didn't have chips and salsa.
14689 Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow.
14690 But they're slammed and deservedly so.
14691 are you joking?
14692 Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere?
14693 I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this.
14694 Their meats are fantastic.
14695 I discovered this place after driving by it so many times.
14696 thought I'd take a chance.
14697 Location is awful.
14698 but worth the trip.
14699 Excellent place.
14700 I have eaten here several times and the place is always busy.
14701 The sushi is good and you can order things that are not on the menu if you know what you want.
14702 I have a friend who works for Intel with a lot of Asians and they frequent this place a lot, which is how I came to discover this place.
14703 The prices are good and are much cheaper than the RA or Kona when you take into account how big the portions are.
14704 TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.
14705 He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.
14706 Very grateful, and I will continue referring!
14707 "Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop."
14708 Heaven!
14709 !
14710 "Wait, we're in Arizona?"
14711 " No seriously, this is Arizona?"
14712 I had to keep blinking cause I could've sworn we were still in the East Bay last Friday night as we waited for our faux meat meals to arrive at our table.
14713 My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly, neither of us were too stoked on the visit.
14714 We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix??
14715 Anyways... she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green.
14716 I LOVED EVERYTHING.
14717 From our appetizers (hummus + fries) to my entree- I had the chicken curry noodle bowl, to my beverage- a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade (YUM) to my soy ice cream treat (I had the mint with paul newman oreos!)
14718 which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed.
14719 This place is ridiculously good.
14720 And reasonably priced.
14721 And fresh.
14722 And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway.
14723 Basically, this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near... Tempe.
14724 Which fortunately we do not, but I have to say, you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green.
14725 And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ!!
14726 :D
14727 My six year old daughter and I enjoyed a fun and memorable date night at Melting Pot last night.
14728 It was her first exposure to fondue and we had a blast eating great food and talking about her first three days of first grade.
14729 We starteed with a fantastic spinach and artichoke fontina & butterkäse cheese fondue, then shared the "Land & Sea" (filet mignon, chicken and shrimp).
14730 Of course, when the dessert menu came out so did a bit more enthusiasm.
14731 She had never dreamed of seeing a pot of melted chocolate before.
14732 The looks on her face were priceless.
14733 She chose the "Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream" and it was crazy good.
14734 I'm looking forward to taking the whole family and to making this a more common stop on our date night calendar.
14735 Have eaten here several times.
14736 Always amazing.
14737 Love the buffet, the folks that work there are great, we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want.
14738 Small but worth it.
14739 Great selection of gelato!
14740 Friendly welcoming staff.
14741 Reasonably priced, deliciously rich gelato!
14742 The BEST brewery I've ever been to.
14743 Amazing beer and awesome food (I didn't think that combo was actually possible)!
14744 I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU.
14745 Whenever I go back to Phoenix, this is always a must on my list!
14746 I have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night.
14747 I took a huge hiatus as I was in Michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in Phoenix and transitioning into a new job- I was sad because I thought they would've forgotten me.
14748 I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all.
14749 I love that!
14750 We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas (a personal favorite) and the mushroom appetizer.
14751 The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite.
14752 The patatas bravas really never fail- they remind me of my Mom's version of french fries.
14753 I'd highly recommend this place for a date- it seems to pay off in more ways than one.
14754 Always great service and interesting eats- still lovin' Tuck Shop for being in my neighborhood!
14755 Was not expecting such a wonderful meal in a shopping center!
14756 After some shopping my husband and I were starving.....this was the first place we stumbled upon that was still serving their lunch menu at 3:30pm.
14757 For starters we tried the calamari....delicious....lovely deep fried lemon and zucchini pieces amongst the calamari pieces.
14758 For mains we both tried the tomato and basil soup....very tasty.
14759 The veal meatball that my husband had and that I had to sample was also very good....smothered in a nice tangy, rich sauce.
14760 My vegetarian pizza was the best one I have had in years....super fresh ingredients on a very tasty base.
14761 For dessert the gelato profiteroles smothered in chocolate sauce were simply devine!
14762 Needless to say we loved this place not just due to the amazing food but also the atmosphere (may be in a shopping area but still nice and cozy) and the great staff who were very friendly.
14763 Will probably dine here every shopping trip : )
14764 Went back with some veggie friends of mine and wasn't disappointed.
14765 One of them ordered the regular flour quesadilla, and they loved it.
14766 It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious.
14767 I will probably order this next time I go.
14768 Also, the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit.
14769 The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla.
14770 She liked it but didn't love it.
14771 I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good.
14772 I don't know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items.
14773 As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy.
14774 We had to wait to be seated.
14775 Love this place!
14776 How have I not reviewed this place on Yelp?
14777 I reviewed them for Check Please, Arizona!, a PBS review show.
14778 http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/.
14779 I could at least do a written review.
14780 I've eaten at FEZ so many times, I can't count anymore.
14781 I think their burgers are some of the best I've ever had in the valley.
14782 Always juicy, I think the square patties are adorable.
14783 The FEZ burger, with it's molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, providing fireworks for the tounge.
14784 Their Douxelle burger, with sauteed mushrooms, provolone cheese &  mustard, resulting in a subdued but delicious burger.
14785  Their fries, which include normal, sweet potato, harissa, & garlic are also great, but I love the salad that comes default, including their lemon dressing.
14786 If burgers & fries aren't your thing, they have Kisras( think like pizza, minus the cheese), and their daily specials are amazing.
14787 One time, I was lucky enough to score the mushroom risotto, and it was perfect.
14788 Sugar snap peas,
14789 Drinks are fantastic too.
14790 A margarita that doesn't taste like chemicals, perfect martini's, and a G-Spot(grapefruit, pom, and vodka), make FEZ a perfect place for lunch or dinner.
14791 Great food!
14792 Good prices.
14793 Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star.
14794 I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner.
14795 Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together.
14796 You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter.
14797 It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch.
14798 You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts?
14799 How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders?
14800 Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.
14801 But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring.
14802 One star would be giving it a holiday gift!
14803 For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation.
14804 Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.
14805 My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs.
14806 They were extremely over-cooked.
14807 There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.
14808 Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable.
14809 The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.
14810 Nothing had improved.
14811 They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect.
14812 In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
14813 Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were.
14814 When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night.
14815 The so called "dry-rub" seasoning was tasteless.
14816 The BBQ sauce is major strange!
14817 The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging.
14818 ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.
14819 Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.
14820 The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!
14821 Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.
14822 Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.
14823 I'm still waiting.
14824 "Fine dining" is not just a setting.
14825 it isn't just good food.
14826 It is many things that add up to an attitude.
14827 I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities.
14828 I found it the other night at the Stockyards.
14829 We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.
14830 Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.
14831 It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.
14832 When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.
14833 She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.
14834 Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.
14835 When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.
14836 I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.
14837 If I'd been finished I could have told them.
14838 We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.
14839 The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.
14840 All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.
14841 At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.
14842 After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.
14843 There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.
14844 My friend had ordered a small steak.
14845 My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.
14846 A potato also was served with her dish.
14847 I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.
14848 She look at me and said "Prepared with?"
14849 She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.
14850 She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.
14851 One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.
14852 When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.
14853 Kudos to, Kathy!!!.
14854 That is part of the fine dining experience.
14855 I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.
14856 The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.
14857 I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.
14858 My friend said, "Yummy!"
14859 and I agreed.
14860 I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.
14861 My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.
14862 I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!
14863 Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.
14864 The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money.
14865 They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.
14866 They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.
14867 Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.
14868 Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.
14869 I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.
14870 I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.
14871 i love this place.
14872 i can always spent all my money here on something.
14873 they have great sales racks, but also reasonable clothes not on sale too.
14874 the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly.
14875 Also if you get bored of shopping for clothes, they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy.
14876 I spent almost 2 years searching for a good nail salon in the North Scottsdale area and I will never go anywhere else again.
14877 It is very clean, the girls are very nice, and they always do a really good job on my nails.
14878 They are upfront about their pedicure prices - they hand you a price sheet that tells you exactly what you get for each upgrade - instead of pressuring you into getting something better and then upcharging you.
14879 I think their prices are super reasonable as well.
14880 For the best pedicure and a french gel manicure I pay $70.
14881 I usually make appointments (Sunday mornings are nicely uncrowded), but I've also walked in and been taken fairly quickly.
14882 I love this place and will recommend it to anyone who asks!
14883 I love vegetarian restaurants!
14884 I support them 200%.
14885 So glad this place exists in Phoenix.
14886 The quality of the food is beyond excellent.
14887 The meals are creative and super tasty.
14888 Never disappointed.
14889 The only qualm I have is the service.
14890 It...is...slow.
14891 Whether it's the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly.
14892 The length of time it takes should not be so long.
14893 Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others.
14894 I don't mind paying more for quality.
14895 Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit.
14896 I can't wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe.
14897 Ruth's Chris, the only steak house I can fully endorse.
14898 500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience.
14899 The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right.
14900 While every salad they have is a can't miss, I'll go there just to get the Chop Salad.
14901 Place is always friend, and I LOVE THE PIZZA.
14902 It's by far my favorite pizza place.
14903 Sign up on their VIP newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday, get it for free and try it.
14904 Sounds good to me.
14905 Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa.
14906 Let me tell you what you are in for if you go.
14907 The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level.
14908 Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard's Pie.
14909 The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well.
14910 If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it's the best I've ever had.
14911 If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs.
14912 Or if you are you are up to it go with both.
14913 When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate!
14914 It could be scorching bloody hot.
14915 Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well, just stay clam it will cool soon enough.
14916 When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert.
14917 By now you will feel very full, I know, I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it.
14918 Cheers!
14919 We've been going to Santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house.
14920 We've never had a bad item here.
14921 It's a fun place to go and the food is great.
14922 We always order pizza which is consistently good.
14923 Their salads are excellent - all their ingredients are very fresh and there's enough for two meals if you're a lighter eater.
14924 And the wings are always excellent.
14925 We've always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming.
14926 It's a great place to watch a game - if you can get in!
14927 Friday and Saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our take-out pizza.
14928 The parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and there's a dollar theater next door.
14929 You can park in back (the side toward the freeway) if there's no room in the front.
14930 We moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and Santisi was still there, and as good as ever.
14931 Oh Chipotle, I love you.
14932 Healthy options even when craving Mexican!
14933 My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.
14934 Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.
14935 I've been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.
14936 5 stars to you, my friend.
14937 These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads.
14938 If you like your food (a) locally grown; (b) freshly made; (c) organic/all natural; and (d) yummy - and who doesn't?
14939 - this is the place for you.
14940 Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.
14941 So pay attention:
14942 1.
14943 Look at menu.
14944 2.
14945 Decide what you want.
14946 3.
14947 Wait your turn to order.
14948 4.
14949 Order (give your name).
14950 5.
14951 Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed.
14952 6.
14953 Pay her.
14954 7.
14955 Wait until your food is ready.
14956 8.
14957 Leave with your food.
14958 Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners.
14959 It's all good.
14960 Delicious, clean, great service!
14961 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was.
14962 We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich - both were moist and fresh.
14963 Dinner for 2 for 20.00!
14964 I love this second location in the Royal coffee series as much as the one at the market!
14965 Since it's summer - I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you don't even have to add anything to it!!
14966 Don't believe me?
14967 Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded!
14968 A quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to work/study/read as well as a great place for delicious grab n' go coffee in the Biltmore area!
14969 TIP #1 to Mesa-Gateway fliers: This is the ONLY bar at the airport, so live it-love it.
14970 Food is great.
14971 The burgers can be made low-carb - especially great this gurl!
14972 TIP #2: Food can be ordered to go...
14973 Truly a great owner who cares about his customers!
14974 I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind, quality pieces....young, yet classic, tasteful, yet funky.
14975 "
14976 I'm so in love with this place :) I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED.
14977 i love that they have a fresh herb/vegetable garden in the front.
14978 It's all about the FRESH ingredients these days.
14979 I can't wait to go back and try different dishes.
14980 I'd like to try the cheese platters :) mouth watering as we speak.
14981 going again to day so I'll keep adding to this review.
14982 STAY TUNED!
14983 BTW, the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area.
14984 This place was just... okay.
14985 First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful.
14986 But to me most of the other saleswomen had "desperation" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission, or if the higher ups are just slave laborers, or what, but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale).
14987 I found a few dresses I liked, but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot, so I decided to wait on it.
14988 I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else.
14989 I notified David's Bridal "thanks but no thanks" about 6 months ago.
14990 To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to "come back in and try on the dress"... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world!
14991 So annoying.
14992 Plus their accessories are so expensive, and very cookie cutter.
14993 I'd go somewhere else, unless you're new to this and need some ideas.
14994 Tried this restaurant with a groupon.
14995 Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon.
14996 Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in.
14997 The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly.
14998 And the food, WOW!
14999 We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate.
15000 The portions were very generous.
15001 I ordered the fruit drink.
15002 Everything was absolutely delicious.
15003 One of my new favorite restaurants .
15004 Will definitely be back.
15005 Intense!
15006 I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here.
15007 Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley.
15008 I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again.
15009 Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot.
15010 I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings.
15011 The taco was like eating out of a horse trough..
15012 It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth.
15013 After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken.
15014 The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them.
15015 Please do your self a favor..
15016 Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil.
15017 It sure beats the hell out of this joint.
15018 No joke.
15019 A great little spot to find!
15020 Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Sushi and great eats!
15021 Be sure to try the green bean appetizer!
15022 We had read good things about Over Easy, and were excited to try it out.
15023 We went a few days after Christmas, and were horribly disappointed.
15024 When we walked in, we were seated by one server.
15025 Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works?
15026 We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.
15027 Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food.
15028 Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes.
15029 They had completely lost our order.
15030 When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible.
15031 The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon.
15032 The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through.
15033 I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt.
15034 The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about.
15035 And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful.
15036 We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed.
15037 At which point, our server asked if we'd like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche.
15038 It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it, since it was obviously not eaten.
15039 Anyway, I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else.
15040 This is place IS Beer Heaven!
15041 Over 100+ taps of amazing beers!
15042 This is the ONLY place I will purchase [several] beers at full price, not on happy hour.
15043 Amazing thing #2 ~ (for the girls) they have a "shorty" glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz, it is a beautiful thing!
15044 Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full (er bloated), instead of the two big 12oz glasses!
15045 Amazing thing #3 ~ The food is delish!!!
15046 My boyfriend and I split a burger.
15047 Bad idea.
15048 It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall ;)
15049 Amazing thing #4 ~ The staff are awesome!
15050 There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA.
15051 They are very attentive, friendly and helpful if you can't decide :)
15052 Amazing thing #5 ~ The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great!
15053 As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets.
15054 They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday.
15055 The box comes with plenty to eat, including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering.
15056 The meal includes sushi, salad, rice, chicken (teriyaki or such), gyoza, some type of fried fish and an orange.
15057 For about $8-$10 it's hard to find a better deal.
15058 I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal.
15059 It is small, quiet and a little hard to see from the street, which makes it a unique place with low traffic, but high quality.
15060 I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour.
15061 I've been here tons of times since I moved to AZ.
15062 Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town.
15063 Happy hour from 4-7 LOVE IT (I get mad when places are 3-6- who gets off work that early??).
15064 And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour.
15065 Really cheap wine, beer, and liquor.
15066 Ya their food isn't orgasm AMAZING but it's pretty good.
15067 I've havn't disliked anything I've tried there.
15068 I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels.
15069 I've been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful.
15070 They keep em coming.
15071 The food is good breakfast food.
15072 I take family/friends from out of town here for happy hours.
15073 I love this place I don't get what the hate is about!
15074 Nice casita that can sleep 6 for $99, plus free breakfast.
15075 What a deal.
15076 Service was excellent but the catered food was TERRIBLE!
15077 I have had a couple of peels at A-Peeling Faces and they were the best I've ever had!
15078 They are not only very reasonable priced, but Darla Salem really knows her stuff.
15079 My skin has never looked better!
15080 I am very pleased.
15081 Had a fantastic experience!
15082 Hernan, our server was excellent.
15083 Knowledgable and charming.
15084 The food was fantastic.
15085 The chefs selection meat and cheese tray was insane.
15086 Crazy flavor.
15087 Well done!
15088 Oh my goodness, Hank is awesome!
15089 We've had nothing but problems with landscapers and we finally found someone we'll be sticking with.
15090 Hank is very professional, knowledgeable, responsive, prompt, communicates thoroughly and is very reasonable.
15091 And by the way...he's actually there doing the work!
15092 Trust me, we've gone through them all and I had almost given up hope.
15093 Hank has been better than expected - we almost don't want to tell anyone so he doesn't get too busy for us!
15094 :)
15095 Some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix.
15096 I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little...eh... but who cares if the food's good!
15097 I love the crust, crispy and slightly chewy.
15098 The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, it's pizza), but as long as it doesn't soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!)
15099 it's nothing that a paper towel or two can't fix!
15100 I'm not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they're pretty good.
15101 The staff has always been super-friendly, and they actually remember me, even though I only come in once every couple months!
15102 Los Olivos is a Scottsdale institution and I won't hear a word against them.
15103 Especially not when I have a few margaritas in me.
15104 They take good care of regulars, especially at Happy Hour.
15105 The chips and salsa are delicious and they keep them coming.
15106 I recommend the mini menu, they are a great way to sample stuff if you like to try a lot of different things, but my favorite meal is definitely the Chicken Poblano.
15107 Mmm, so good!
15108 The shrimp chimi is also fantastic.
15109 I never leave without feeling totally stuffed.
15110 I finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what I want.
15111 Very happy with the service.
15112 Also, the waxing lady is very nice...I think her name is Maria, does good eyebrows.
15113 Only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short notice...but that's my fault for waiting until I can't stand it anymore to get my hair cut.
15114 One of a kind place to experience all senses!!
15115 Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.
15116 Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).
15117 I won't spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself!
15118 ;)
15119 This place is absolutely amazing.
15120 If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go.
15121 It a little hole-in-the-wall looking place, but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches, your mind will change.
15122 I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie, but when it's fall, I can't pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie.
15123 I've never found anything like it since.
15124 Oh, where to begin..
15125 I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.
15126 The place was packed.
15127 The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.
15128 The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.
15129 I'm so glad we did.
15130 We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.
15131 I think we waited maybe ten minutes.
15132 After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.
15133 Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.
15134 The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.
15135 The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.
15136 Made ya feel that something good was to come.
15137 Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?
15138 So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.
15139 It would be a share-a-meal night..
15140 About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.
15141 Please please.. you've got to try this.
15142 It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.
15143 The taste literally melted in my mouth.
15144 To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.
15145 I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.
15146 Sadly, I had to share..
15147 After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.
15148 I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.
15149 There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food.
15150 I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food.
15151 DV Nail, may I help you?
15152 YES!
15153 You can - and always well.
15154 I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great.
15155 I've "cheated" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail.
15156 Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers.
15157 You actually feel like you're getting worked on.
15158 They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price.
15159 It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good.
15160 They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time.
15161 A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip.
15162 I think that's great.
15163 I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great.
15164 Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait.
15165 I'd recommend an appointment.
15166 I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go.
15167 that can only mean it's good right?
15168 Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting.
15169 i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable.
15170 best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it.
15171 i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty.
15172 my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine.
15173 breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot.
15174 It's a supermarket.
15175 I just go in buy what I need and get out.
15176 It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well.
15177 To the negative experience.....
15178 My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.
15179 Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, "Can't you speak english?"
15180 WTF?!?
15181 Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?
15182 It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.
15183 I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.
15184 I'm not done yet.
15185 Keep on reading....
15186 My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.
15187 We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.
15188 One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.
15189 Calm down.
15190 Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.
15191 Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?
15192 Swear...
15193 Racial profiling.
15194 We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast.
15195 Our server was Colleen.
15196 She was very attentive and we had  a great meal.
15197 The menu is so extensive with many ,many options.
15198 I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast.
15199 They were both delish!
15200 Their Potatoes are fab!!
15201 The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.
15202 Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well.
15203 We will defiantly come back here soon.
15204 I love Christmas-time and I especially love it because I know that Luminarias is back and this year it's better than ever!
15205 The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden.
15206 Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed!
15207 I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults.
15208 It's romantic if you're on a date, it's festive if you're with your family and it's just pure fun if you're with friends.
15209 You enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden.
15210 Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite, hot cocoa and raspberry vodka!
15211 If you're hungry, they sell food throughout the garden at two locations.
15212 Then there are the performers.
15213 The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size.
15214 Whether it's a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night!
15215 I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden.
15216 With so many live acts in one area, you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area.
15217 Their event planners did an amazing job!
15218 Luminarias is my favorite Arizona activity during the holidays and I can't wait to go back next year!
15219 !
15220 One word can describe the food here:  perfection.
15221 All the meals I've had here has been absolutely delicious served by the most charming waitstaff.
15222 Someone recently told me their Chilean Sea Bass was the best he's ever had and I believe him .
15223 .
15224 .
15225 I can't wait to taste that dish!
15226 All I have to say is WOW!
15227 This place is EXCELLENT!
15228 All the dishes we had were extremely fresh, authentic, and DELICIOUS!
15229 My favorite pot stickers EVER.
15230 The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time.
15231 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable!
15232 The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.
15233 It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?)
15234 underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.
15235 MMMMMMmmmmm.
15236 The green curry is more brothy than others than other's that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.
15237 I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.
15238 You may need a spoon :)
15239 The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.
15240 The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection.
15241 Their sauces are spot on.
15242 BEST Coconut ice cream!
15243 It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!
15244 It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS!
15245 Even if you don't like curries, there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan!
15246 This is a mom and pop kind of place, they are really nice.
15247 It's a trek for us, but definitely worth the drive!
15248 I really like this bar & restaurant.
15249 I usually come here to meet up with a friend and sit at the main bar.
15250 It is modern and clean.
15251 There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.
15252 They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tv's as well.
15253 I have only had a burger and fries here.
15254 They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay.
15255 The staff here is friendly & speedy.
15256 I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse.
15257 Really nice!
15258 I'm new to the area and I stumbled upon them.
15259 They are fast and not very expensive.
15260 I was a little turned off by the number of really old men working there, but they had their regular client list.
15261 It was like one side was "old men" hair stylists and the other side was the "young girl" stylists.
15262 The two sides didn't really associate, which I found rather weird.
15263 But, none the less, a great hair style at a great price!!
15264 !
15265 This may be my worst dining experience ever.
15266 The scenery was beautiful, we can't complain about that.
15267 The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from.
15268 However the prices were definitely high, we're just talking tacos & burritos here...
15269 I ordered a taco salad with steak.
15270 It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.
15271 When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions.
15272 The steak was DISCUSTING.
15273 I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat.
15274 I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said "most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something".
15275 Great service, huh?
15276 I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down.
15277 Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla).
15278 The Patron rita was $16!!
15279 !
15280 The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new "gig".
15281 The prices were ridiculous!
15282 I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!
15283 !
15284 Stayed at the hotel from 11/18 till 11/23/12.
15285 Excellent hotel and the stuff was great.
15286 Originally was supposed to come during Hurricane Sandy and couldn't fly out as I was affected by the storm..
15287 The hotel staff had no problem changing my reservation and didn't even change the price.
15288 Everything was great.
15289 The room was clean.
15290 The pool was excellent.
15291 Completely shady.
15292 Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.
15293 Completely unethical and total crooks.
15294 AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
15295 I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while.
15296 I guess just eat during their limited hours very often.
15297 They close very early (4pm).
15298 I love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication.
15299 As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean.
15300 I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale.
15301 All were yummy, delicious and satisfying!
15302  As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley.
15303 There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish.
15304 I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer.
15305 OMG!
15306 what is the rave about?
15307 this place is disgusting!
15308 it's dirty and the food is not worth it!
15309 i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there.
15310 unfortunately everything is bad.
15311 i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other.
15312 the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil .
15313 ick!
15314 go to Pho ao sen instead at least it's clean.
15315 Food Truck Fav right here!
15316 I've been wanting to try Pizza People's Pizza for a while now.
15317 I found out they were setting up at 180 Degree's Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out!
15318 I finally caught up with them at Local Fest.
15319 Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy!
15320 First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal!
15321 Secondly, Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world...and I trust her implicitly....so I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes.
15322 I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato.
15323 I took it back to my table to share with my Mama (who is also gluten free) and we both said at about the same time: " Oh, my gosh this is really good!"
15324 Something I've only said about twice since eating gf pizza!
15325 The sauce is fresh, the dough was the best gf dough I've had to date and the toppings were just divine.
15326 I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily!
15327 (Oh, wait.........I can just check their facebook page!)
15328 Yeah, I'd eat it daily!
15329 It's that good!
15330 Horrible service.
15331 Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink.
15332 I work for Starbucks!!
15333 It's not hard to get a drink right!
15334 Believe me.
15335 Horrible service.
15336 The people that work there All have bad attitude.
15337 One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink.
15338 I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for.
15339 Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore.
15340 I stopped going.
15341 They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee.
15342 Horrible.
15343 I'm currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days.
15344 A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon.
15345 Although I've sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face, I am truly enjoying this trip.
15346 There's a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills.
15347 Awesome and I mean it.
15348 My hubby is out on his meetings and I'm juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ).
15349 Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack.
15350 Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the  handsome young german ;)).
15351 Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish.
15352 My lil' girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?)
15353 with peaches and berries..
15354 I had a few spoonful, yummy.
15355 Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty.
15356 I still have until tomorrow.
15357 Maybe if I have time, I'll head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah.
15358 Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun.
15359 Simply love the view.
15360 It takes me away from everything.
15361 I'm in heavenly desert.Highly recommended.
15362 This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home).
15363 I have been to a U.S.
15364 Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010.
15365 I love breakfast food and the "specialty" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES!
15366 As the timeless Tina Turner once said, "Simply the Best!".
15367 That describes these pancakes perfectly.
15368 Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc.
15369 This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?).
15370 Nothing fancy, but I don't need a "Jacket Required" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast.
15371 The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys.
15372 I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive.
15373 To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e.
15374 refills, requests for jelly, etc.)
15375 I don't care if you bring the bill with the food.
15376 If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill.
15377 Now on to the food!
15378 !
15379 The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds.
15380 The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them).
15381 The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time.
15382 I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :).
15383 All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy.
15384 I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER).
15385 :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O).
15386 Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area.
15387 You can see and hear from anywhere in the place, and the grassy risers were such a good idea.
15388 The sound was excellent for the two shows I've been to there.
15389 Really just an overall nice, peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather.
15390 Parking isn't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags.
15391 To top it all of, getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there.
15392 Kaley helped me get the best room in Mesa AZ, my view was awesome.
15393 The beds were clean, and the service was awesome, with a great cafe style restaurant.
15394 I am recommending to all my friends to call Kaley for a hook up!
15395 Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.
15396 Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.
15397 There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.
15398 As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.
15399 This is THE Waffle House to visit.
15400 Go now, do it.
15401 How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?
15402 That's right, Pretty Damn Good.
15403 Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!
15404 (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon
15405 Now worthy of 5 stars for replacing their toilet with one that actually flushes.
15406 It's always nice when a place that sells diuretic beverages has a working toilet.
15407 ---
15408 The baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house, by their employees.
15409 The coffee is roasted right there, on site.
15410 Iced tea refills are free, bitches.
15411 The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes.
15412 Now, I like to coast, but shit...  Gotta give them cred.
15413 If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly.
15414 If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away.
15415 The new tables are great.
15416 There are power outlets everywhere.
15417 It's next to Pane Bianco.
15418 I run into my homies there on the regular.
15419 When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho, there is no competitor.
15420 Jeff, the owner, is a cool dude.
15421 The seating outside is nice.
15422 I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office.
15423 I seriously probably spend about 16 hours a week there or so, maybe more some weeks, working on my laptop and occasionally people watching.
15424 Did I mention that I kind of like this place?
15425 This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at, everything is so close that it only take 10-15 mins to get where you want to be, and on top of that, there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games.
15426 I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great one.!!!
15427 !Plus the weather is always great!
15428 !
15429 This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.
15430 This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds.
15431 How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food?
15432 It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs.
15433 This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there.
15434 It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food.
15435 One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make.
15436 The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down.
15437 They should fire the manager and everyone that works there.
15438 They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this.
15439 It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there.
15440 I will NOT be returning to this place.......
15441 I took the pole dance aerobics class last night, and man am i feeling it today!
15442 everyone there was really welcoming and had great advice for me, as ive never tried this kind of thing before.
15443 it's tucked away, and at first i had no clue where it was, but its worth the search!
15444 had a blast, got a great work out, and felt great afterwards, im definitely going back for more!!
15445 !
15446 Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation.
15447 Massages were amazing.
15448 Drinks and brunch were amazing.
15449 Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need.
15450 Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place, but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool, sauna and steam.
15451 Also, the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing.
15452 I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff.
15453 I will return
15454 Good food, great atmosphere, great service and great prices!
15455 We will definitely be back!
15456 Can't wait to try the Sunday Brunch!
15457 I really (REALLY) like The Lodge so I was gonna give it 4 stars.
15458 To be honest though, I really can't think of any good reason NOT to give it that 5th star.
15459 I've mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ, but I've also stopped in a few late nights, and have always had a good time.
15460 The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours (deal wise) in Old Town.
15461 All apps (except the mac & cheese and fried pickles) are half off along w/$2 cheap drafts, $3 Lodge signature drafts (which is a tasty beer) & $3 wells (stuck to beer on this last trip, but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour).
15462 I've tried quite a few of the apps, and they're all good.
15463 The pretzels & cheese are particularly tasty.
15464 I always get pretzels & cheese no matter where I am w/the friend I came here w/for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say I've tried quite a few in my day & the Lodge's ranks right up there!
15465 I admit I'm a sucker for cheesy theme bars, so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here.
15466 the dining room area isn't huge, but is clean w/comfy seats.
15467 The bar area is pretty big & the patio is nice, weather permitting.
15468 I've never had an issue w/the service here & both bartenders & bouncers are always nice.
15469 So going on vacation in a week and wanted to get a brazilian for the first time.
15470 I gotta say the technician, Christine, was great!
15471 She tells you what to expect and tosses in a little humor to keep you comfortable.
15472 It was very clean, the wax isn't to hot, and the technician never double dipped.
15473 I found the place very clean and comfortable.
15474 Pricing is just right too.
15475 I like that there are options to buy it for a year and go anywhere they have a shop.
15476 I did get told about product as others reviewed.
15477 However, I didn't feel pushed because Christine explained how it can be used and why.
15478 In addition, she told me of other uses for the product.
15479 It was an all around good experience that I would recommend to any friend wanting to get waxed.
15480 My dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then, I keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as Shimagamo is the best sushi I've had anywhere.
15481 I've had sushi in CA, NY, TX and HI.
15482 The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous.
15483 One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths, assuming you are having sushi.
15484 In my experience, sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed.
15485 This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar (which I haven't found anywhere else.)
15486 The Suprise Crazy Roll, served with a sweet wasabi sauce, is always on our Sushi order.
15487 The only con is that this place is pricey, but they do have a daily 5-7 happy hour that contains some great options.
15488 However, the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu.
15489 Also, this isn't a place to have Sake bombs.
15490 It's a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal.
15491 You'll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars.
15492 I was told this was the spot where many Japanese baseball players come to have their Sushi.
15493 The restaurant is very non-descript.
15494 It sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by it's neighbor C-Fu Gourmet.
15495 This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe.
15496 If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses, you will see exactly what goes on.
15497 to the left at least four people playing chess, to the right someone reading a book, but sitting next to someone writing a book, and did someone just walk in with a puppy?
15498 Yes.
15499 As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order.
15500 Well, they are known for their cappuccinos, which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona, I recommend their "Dirty Horchata" or "Espresso Excellente" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso.
15501 It was good for the minute it lasted.
15502 See you there next time.
15503 Mmm!
15504 Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes.
15505 I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.
15506 I'm a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didn't have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy.
15507 I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.
15508 It was fantastic!
15509 I can't wait to go back.
15510 ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for "making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices".
15511 A memorable gesture!
15512 Many have started out with this and it should be stressed , this wonderful place is TINY!
15513 Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store.
15514 We started with the stuffed mushrooms , like many others raved about, and the Portuguese style mussels.
15515 Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well.
15516 The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in.
15517 We're we're pretty full, but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza.
15518 Hands down the best pizza we have ever had.
15519 The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth!
15520 Feels more like you have been invited to a friend's house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant.
15521 Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic (even the entirely needy, hard to please, and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us)
15522 While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait, suggest you  make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place
15523 This place never ceases to amaze.
15524 One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix.
15525 The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great.
15526 We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger.
15527 It should not be surprising that is was fantastic.
15528 Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!
15529 Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago.
15530 There still might be someone in line tho...
15531 I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities.
15532 This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park.
15533 Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store.
15534 I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available.
15535 Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge.
15536 Had lunch at Bliss again ... still yummy as always!
15537 This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string  parmesan cheese fries.
15538 I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
15539 I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays.
15540 Today a I found a new addiction, french crullers, uhhh they are soo good.
15541 Melt in your mouth.
15542 This is a great little hidden gem!
15543 From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice.
15544 The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level.
15545 The waitstaff are also very friendly.
15546 They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an "order at the counter" place.
15547 Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!
15548 This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ!
15549 Fresh fish, good portions, and great service.
15550 A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce!
15551 Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like.
15552 I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.
15553 The staff is also very attentive.
15554 They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly.
15555 The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars.
15556 As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs.
15557 There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right?
15558 Check this place out and judge for yourself!
15559 Amazing sushi.
15560 Fast, clean, fresh.
15561 Friendly staff.
15562 Favorites are Arizona, Beauty, Alaska, and Spicy Ninja, although everything here is some of the best around hands down!
15563 WOW!!!
15564 A real European bakery!
15565 This was awesome, after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachi's and walnut roll home for later.
15566 The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.
15567 Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.
15568 The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.
15569 mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.
15570 Next special occasion my cake is coming from there.
15571 :-)
15572 The one we visited is
15573 13331 W. Indian School Rd.
15574 Litchfield Park, AZ 85340 USA
15575 623-547-4655
15576 this place is awesome.
15577 GO.
15578 & soon - already decent wait times.
15579 OH, pitches of pbr for 7 bucks.
15580 yeah, yeah.
15581 shut up.
15582 GO GO GO.
15583 I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ.
15584 I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close.
15585 I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.
15586 If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.
15587 But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.
15588 They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.
15589 It is a different approach but seriously good!
15590 The "Mike's Way" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.
15591 Their signature sandwich is the #13.
15592 It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.
15593 Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!
15594 It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.
15595 Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long, but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.
15596 I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.
15597 And, I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.
15598 They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful, helpful people.
15599 Not a necessity for a sandwich, but certainly a lot better than the opposite.
15600 I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.
15601 This place was once known as J Chew and Company.
15602 I loved that place and this new version is still great.
15603 So comfy, so casual, so welcoming and so non-scottsdaley it's just the best.
15604 I'm not a fan of chains.
15605 I far prefer to find, and give my business to, new and interesting local fare.
15606 That said, there are a couple of chains I like and one is Texas Roadhouse.
15607 Texas Roadhouse does two things really well: steak and portions.
15608 I can go to a Texas Roadhouse anywhere and get a well-made ribeye at a very reasonable price.
15609 It made not be "fork tender" or the same quality as a $50 ribeye, but it'll only cost me $18 and I know it will be far superior to any other, more expensive, chain steakhouse.
15610 But before I get that steak, I'll get peanuts, bread, salad, and sides.
15611 So I'll likely have half a steak for lunch the next day.
15612 Like I said, well made steak and portions.
15613 I'm good with that.
15614 I picked up a jar of fresh-made salsa and chips for the Superbowl party I was attending last Sunday because they are that outstanding!
15615 They were a big hit!
15616 If you are dining at the Blue Adobe, definitely try the chips and salsa.
15617 I am not a big fan of chipotle seasoning... it is definitely one of the key ingredients, but regardless I think it tastes great.
15618 If you like it, you can buy a jar of the fresh salsa and take it home with you for about $9 (it is a good sized jar).
15619 This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area and the best!
15620 The food is very delicious and the owner, Preet, is very hospitable.
15621 Too bad I no longer live in Ahwatukee.
15622 All I could think of when I was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier, is how mouth-watering Star of India's chicken tikka masala is.... Yumm!
15623 A must visit!
15624 Great quality food, atmosphere, and location.
15625 This is a place to take a date to or just to have an enjoyable evening with great food.
15626 The meatloaf (When they have it) is amazing.
15627 Steak is also top ofthe line.. Definitely recommend..
15628 What's all the fuss?
15629 I'm not sure what folks compare this chain too?
15630 The Dead Duck Inn?
15631 Joe's local Chinese Gag house?
15632 Are those places that great?
15633 Sooo fresh and delicious!?
15634 Not in my days?
15635 Pre-made sitting around and HEAVY oil is what I see from most other establishments.
15636 Even those touted by friends.
15637 Maybe it's because they know George from behind the counter.
15638 It's not Pei Wei!
15639 Pei Wei is a quick, fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven.
15640 Even the hard to please Yelper has to admit, the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order.
15641 The food is fresh and prepared to order.
15642 Even fried rice is made to order.
15643 The sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality Chinese ingredients.
15644 (Chili paste, fresh garlic, scallions, bean curd, and a bounty of fresh Chinese vegetables).
15645 Go Yon China will serve you pre-made sauces with no punch and lots of giggle.
15646 The atmosphere at Pei Wei is great!
15647 Black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of Chinese!
15648 Even with the "stand in line" style of dining.
15649 Makes me hungry just thinkin' about the joint.
15650 However, to me it's a take out Ferrari!
15651 Call in, swipe my card and off I go.
15652 Sure, it's not Chang's.
15653 Still, it's better than the local Dead Duck Inn's "food" stained art, with a Chinese New Year paper place mat.
15654 Of course!
15655 I'm looking at the healthier options a Chinese food place may have to offer, and Pei Wei lifts the bar in multiple sets!
15656 Get your chicken steamed, go brown rice, add extra vegetables or go vegetarian.
15657 Still you may complain..."Oh, is it too salty?
15658 Or too sweet?"
15659 Give me a break.
15660 This is CHINESE FOOD!
15661 And, you won't find MSG.
15662 So, if you don't want spicy, salty or sweet; have a meal from Bland of the Rising Sun.
15663 But, if you want a highly under rated treat...I ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean, fresh, made to order and "if you like" healthy Chinese food!
15664 AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a high-quality, local provider of entertainment (Harkins) and they really pale in comparison.
15665 Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center, which is literally right near our house, but we've been there only two or three times in as many years.
15666 Why?
15667 Because AMC doesn't offer a senior discount any longer.
15668 For AMC Management -- Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week?
15669 I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for $12-13 for two but when it's an AMC Theater, it's $20.
15670 Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra "tax"?
15671 The theater is generally clean and nice, but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high, combined with the fact that they don't offer the discount to seniors.
15672 AMC, please just fold up your tent and go away.
15673 We don't need you here.
15674 Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama!
15675 My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch.
15676 She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills.
15677 She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright, right?
15678 Took my real mama there for lunch..
15679 I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile.
15680 Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell.
15681 She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans.
15682 Struck out again with the red chile..
15683 I swear, can no one except La Canasta make red chile?
15684 While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted, well wasn't any beef Ive ever had.
15685 On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then, looks like I ordered the wrong thing!
15686 Place is also uber cheap.
15687 Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine.
15688 If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list!
15689 This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years.
15690 Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere.
15691 They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal!
15692 Don't pass this place up, it's worth it.
15693 My house has never been this clean EVER!!!
15694 I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today!
15695 I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company.
15696 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes.
15697 The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me.
15698 I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis.
15699 Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time.
15700 I am thrilled with the results!
15701 The Flower Studio far exceeded my expectations at my wedding!
15702 Christine is an amazing artist, businesswoman and person.
15703 She made time to meet with me outside her regular hours and really understood my vision for my wedding.
15704 Her arrangements for my wedding were absolutely stunning and really took the event to the next level.
15705 I am more than thrilled with this company and would recommend them to anyone.
15706 Thank you Flower Studio for making my wedding so beautiful.
15707 I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nan's breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back.
15708 In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside.
15709 I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast
15710 Hybrid class!!
15711 Did it a few years back and to this day it's the best workout I've ever had.
15712 Will be going back FOR SURE
15713 Super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around!
15714 I've been here three times and have had terrific food each time.
15715 The meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing.
15716 Portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious!
15717 This is what BBQ is all about, definitely one of the best in Phoenix and we're lucky to have it here in the NW valley!
15718 Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye..
15719 I have been going to Vatoci hair salon for over a year now.
15720 I've had the same stylist from day one and I highly recommend her.
15721 I've never had so many compliments on my hair!
15722 Ask for Marsha (Mirushe) and I guarantee she'll take amazing care of you.
15723 I love that she always remembers what we talk about and asks me about my job and my kids too.
15724 I am sure that Spiro and Vera also do a great job because the people who are in there when I am are regulars and everyone is always happy to be there.
15725 My daughter loved going in to be pampered as well, and they are amazingly flexible on scheduling appointments even though they always seem to have plenty of customers.
15726 They know what they are doing.
15727 Highly recommend!
15728 It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said "what the hell..."
15729 That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in "what the hell is this??"
15730 So positive first.
15731 The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.
15732 Chips and salsa were good.
15733 Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.
15734 Kick... do I sound like an old lady?
15735 Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.
15736 Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.
15737 Not worth it here.
15738 Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.
15739 Beans were... blended?
15740 I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!
15741 This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P
15742 The beef taco was just weird.
15743 I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!
15744 WTF?
15745 I couldn't eat much of it.
15746 Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.
15747 That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.
15748 Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.
15749 LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.
15750 Um, yikes!
15751 He took about 2 bites and was "full".
15752 A.K.A., he didn't like it.
15753 I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.
15754 I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.
15755 Oh well.
15756 One star for the chips and salsa.
15757 Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!
15758 Final verdict?
15759 We decided to NEVER go there again.
15760 Kona grill is never a disappointment.
15761 Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....
15762 The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!
15763 We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!
15764 I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!
15765 I love this place, I want to go to Arizona just to eat here!
15766 The greek fries were really good and different.
15767 It was just really really good.
15768 We're going next time I'm in town Fervor!
15769 "If you buy half a duck, you don't get to pick which duck."
15770 I lived in China, mainly Guangdong, for three years, and all it really took was a look at this sign, along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork, to know I had come across a place with bona fides.
15771 Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live.
15772 I don't know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee, which is actually called "zhou" or "jook," and which is a soupy, delicious rice porridge.
15773 They're also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup, which they do an excellent job of.
15774 Dried scallops, a specialty of HK/Guangdong, are one of the most delicious things in the world.
15775 Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if you've had the pleasure of spending time there.
15776 Otherwise it's just about as close as you can get.
15777 If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you can't beat Hope Kee.
15778 Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and you'll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from.
15779 If you do decide to try your hand at duck-picking and buy a whole duck, fear not for wasted leftovers, because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup.
15780 How can something so simple taste sooo good?
15781 I wish there were one more on the west side.
15782 I hate going to the fair to get my fix of fry bread.
15783 There needs to be one of these on every  corner of the compass in Phoenix!
15784 As Rachel Ray would say, "Yummy!"
15785 This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!!
15786 We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all!
15787 The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job!
15788 I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone.
15789 We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service.
15790 I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the "staining as he would say" off easily.
15791 I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying?
15792 That is exctaly how we felt after the service.
15793 REALLY?!?!
15794 ?
15795 This is my first time trying this place and I had a wonderful experience.
15796 The place was packed and yet they got me in right away.
15797 A young man gave me a pedicure and did a spectacular job.
15798 They even put on a timer for 15 mins to ensure I got a full massage during it.
15799 They offered the other services but did not force any on me.
15800 I will definitely use them again and recommend the place to others.
15801 The best staff around!
15802 Very friendly and always make sure you are satisfied with your food.
15803 The food is great as well.
15804 From breakfast to lunch, and healthy shakes like Fast Fuel, you can get it here.
15805 Very clean too!
15806 Im a sucker for great libations and the stores that can carry the works.. Zinfandel for me.. Magners for my boy.. ( a great Irish cider we fell in love with in SF)..
15807 great tequilas.. all types of wines.. you get my sniffster...
15808 Wow!
15809 The Penang Curry (chicken) was absolutely incredible!!
15810 The portion was huge...had enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day.
15811 I will definitely be back!
15812 The Thai Tea was very good also.
15813 I just wish it was closer to Gilbert!
15814 Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!
15815 Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts.
15816 Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts.
15817 Very disappointed!
15818 !
15819 I'm a huge fan of Padre's!
15820 What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!
15821 One of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa.
15822 This place is absolutely wonderful.
15823 My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice.
15824 Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for.
15825 This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!
15826 I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card.
15827 Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view.
15828 Complimentary menu is refreshing.
15829 Cordial staff.
15830 Quiet and relaxed environment.
15831 Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
15832 its HOTin the valley in the summer time and QT lives up to its name-
15833 ONE STOP DRINK SHOP!
15834 HEAVEN in the summer time and the price is unbeatable!
15835 As a frequent antiques consumer, I can honestly say that Lizabel's Treasures is my favorite antique store in Phoenix.
15836 I've been a customer for several years, and Lizabel's is my first (and often only) stop.
15837 Why Lizabel's is such a treasure is because of these things: price, desirable antiques, and great customer service.
15838 John and Bette know what people want, and they go to great lengths to get the antiques that people want and to make their customers happy.
15839 I'm a believer.
15840 They consistently have one-of-a-kind quality furniture and pieces that you would not normally find elsewhere in town.
15841 Pieces are priced very agreeably, so you can afford to stock up or furnish a whole room without busting the bank.
15842 John and Bette have created the kind of family business that is to be admired.
15843 They have a legion of supportive customers, and I'm one of them.
15844 I can always find them to be helpful and interested in getting me what I want, even if I don't always know what I want.
15845 Lisabel's Treasures is the place to build a relationship with, because as one's life's needs changes, so does the need for different pieces and furniture.
15846 I can always count on finding something I really love at their store, and you will, too.
15847 In a sentance: Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about!
15848 From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than I'd care to read in one sitting, I knew this was going to be good!!
15849 I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at 3pm.
15850 We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back, chill, clean, cozy and yet modern - perfect.
15851 I had the French Dip, thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun.
15852 Everything was good not too salty not too greasy, loved it!
15853 Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible!!
15854 Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish, iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside.
15855 The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor.
15856 I was in love!
15857 this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks!
15858 To my yelpers i say: there is limited parking, so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street, do NOT be alarmed!
15859 there will be a table available!
15860 Another thing, get the fish n chips!
15861 It's duh-vine!
15862 I was so looking forward to breakfast here.
15863 What a disappointment.
15864 The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all.
15865 Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.
15866 The space is nice, but crowded and loud.
15867 The counter staff were indifferent.
15868 After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.
15869 You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered.
15870 Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy.
15871 I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.
15872 Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered.
15873 I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.
15874 If they happen to "run out of numbers", then they input your name with your order.
15875 Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant.
15876 Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... "Lisa?
15877 Is there a Lisa here?"
15878 while your food cools.
15879 Inexcusable.
15880 The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty.
15881 Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg.
15882 But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming.
15883 However, the "side of fruit" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple.
15884 Insulting.
15885 Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient.
15886 Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time.
15887 May have great food but I'll never know.
15888 Ordered delivery and the chef who doesn't speak English couldn't find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away.
15889 He said he was there but couldn't tell me where he was.
15890 Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldn't answer my calls back.
15891 Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful.
15892 The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and can't find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous.
15893 Don't use them for delivery ever, call the Breakfast Joynt.
15894 Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself.
15895 Plus, he actually knows the area.
15896 Cannot express my frustration with this restaurant's service.
15897 Do not use EVER
15898 This is my kind of restaurant.
15899 I love everything about Buca di Beppo!
15900 I am fascinated by how this place was decorated.
15901 All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience.
15902 One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps!
15903 Beyond that the food is awesome!
15904 I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers.
15905 We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had great results.
15906 We had dessert here once too and that was also good!
15907 We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions, which we love.
15908 I can't wait to come again!
15909 I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement.
15910 Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement.
15911 Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - can't beat that.
15912 Well, I cannot believe I have waited this long to give an update on Morgan!!
15913 Especially since she is FANTASTIC!!
15914 Yes, I have been back to her for the 5th time now and I love what she suggested I do to the color on my hair (much better than what I was doing) and her haircuts are the best.
15915 She also has done some other treatments on my hair that have made it hold up under this hard, dry AZ weather.
15916 And, she is so sweet and caring.
15917 Oh, she has also gone out of her way to make an introduction to another of her clients (also from the South) who was new here and had not met many people and we really hit it off.
15918 Morgan knew we would.
15919 I mean what more can you ask for.........go for it...YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.
15920 This from a HAPPY, HAPPY Client, Christine
15921 Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.
15922 The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!
15923 Pancit palabok here is best outside of the Philippines.
15924 Anyone can enjoy a quiet peaceful dinner on a Friday night
15925 My food was delicious and the waitress were nice!
15926 They didn't bother me every 5 minutes and I was able to enjoy my meal.
15927 Spicy does mean spicy here though!
15928 Amazing facility.
15929 Scottsdale healthcare has done a great job, the people are happy to work here unlike some hospitals.
15930 They are very receptive and the ER operates like clockwork.
15931 Amazing.
15932 This is often called the largest mall in Arizona, and it shows.
15933 Each time I've done the usual "mall walk" I've easily lost a few hours trying to see it all.
15934 It's true that this isn't a place for anyone that doesn't care about fashion - but this is a mall that's true to its name.
15935 "Fashion Center" is no joke here.
15936 Lots of high-end designer stores, lots of mid-range affordable fashion stores, and a few random familiar stops like Hallmark and Pottery Barn-esque stores scattered through there.
15937 A decent food court, with a theater also conveniently down there.
15938 (But after spending so many hours at the mall, who has time for a movie?)
15939 You can easily drop a few thousand here, so be forewarned if you're on a budget.
15940 Also, I almost wish I had a map in my pocket, because it can get confusing to remember which hallways you've already explored.
15941 And wear some comfortable walking shoes, because it's not easy to get in and get out of this one.
15942 But there's a good number of parking to use in a garage or few - when you remember where you parked the car.
15943 I'd take any out-of-towner here, unless they had a grudge against fashion, classy stores, or walking.
15944 This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!)
15945 and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos.
15946 The breakfast burrito was the tastiest, bacon filled treat I have ever had!
15947 I love bacon, and if you don't love it as much as I do, the bacon overload may be too much, I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb!
15948 I should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco.
15949 The size of these things are gAstronomical, and the flavor of each are equally proportional, the lengua, however,  would've probably been better if it hadn't been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items!
15950 I will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas, cabeza, lengua, or bacon.
15951 I advise you to do the same!
15952 I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).
15953 Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.
15954 This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.
15955 The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.
15956 Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here.
15957 Followed a Dr. that I respect to this practice and I have to say I'm pretty impressed.
15958 As a long time multi-four-footed caregiver, I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals.
15959 I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of "well of course I want  to have the best care".
15960 The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor.
15961 It doesn't smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room... just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind.
15962 Then there is the overall feel of the place.
15963 The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it.
15964 Files were lost, techs were running, the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients, etc.
15965 This office was peaceful.
15966 Whether is natural or contrived, I could care less.
15967 My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal "OMG what are we doing HERE?!!"
15968 behavior was replaced with something I've never witnessed in a vet office before.
15969 She was calm!
15970 It's clean!
15971 Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing, there were no traces of other animals.
15972 The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.
15973 I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing.
15974 While I was there for one of my pets, the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with "Client Files" so that I wouldn't have to be bothered in the future.
15975 I thought that was a wonderful, time-saving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork.
15976 Finally, I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr.
15977 I was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO.
15978 I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet, in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well!
15979 This place is pretty incredible.
15980 The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO... but seriously, you can't go wrong.
15981 The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.
15982 It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it.
15983 Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side.
15984 Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.
15985 I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad.
15986 I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt!
15987 The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it.
15988 The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate.
15989 They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic.
15990 I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there.
15991 The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.
15992 Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes.
15993 My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol.
15994 The fries were really good though!
15995 My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.
15996 Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.
15997 I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.
15998 All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time.
15999 Love this place!
16000 Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.
16001 I can't wait to go back!
16002 You are in the city but feels miles away!
16003 The spa is amazing!
16004 Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.
16005 Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.
16006 Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.
16007 Overall a wonderful night away.
16008 This is my favorite place to go for Greek food.
16009 The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present.
16010 The food is delicious, large portions, friendly service.
16011 I wish they were located in Surprise, but they are worth the drive.
16012 I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb.
16013 Their selection is also awesome.
16014 I would highly recommend.
16015 Huge store, friendly staff
16016 My car looks better than it did the day I bought it!
16017 OMG this place is good.
16018 Great Italian beef.
16019 Great burgers.
16020 FRY SAUCE.
16021 I don't know how they're pulling off such good food with what they have but it's awesome and I will be eating here if I'm in the area and hungry.
16022 I love my eye doctor!
16023 Platonically, of course.
16024 The entire staff is relaxed, friendly, easy going, and personable.
16025 No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that you've thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.
16026 The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).
16027 The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.
16028 This place treats you like family.
16029 There's a broad range of styles, but mostly, they're fashionable frames.
16030 When I go in, I see a lot of kids, young adults, and 20 and 30-somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses.
16031 Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains, but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time, the lenses are much higher quality, and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that aren't ugly and durability.
16032 Treated with complete disrespect.
16033 Worst service I have ever experienced.
16034 After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store.
16035 Then the manager stepped in, spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave.
16036 He said, "leave, get out, now"
16037 ****************Don't go to this store/don't use verizon******************
16038 Always treat me well, very honest!
16039 !
16040 One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix.
16041 Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees.
16042 Good looking people throughout this bar.
16043 The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now.
16044 Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too.
16045 Great atmosphere and food.
16046 We keep coming back!
16047 Most amazing service!
16048 The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant it's a SPRING ROLL BAR!!
16049 Fantastic drinks!
16050 Great addition
16051 Ahhh, Four Peaks.
16052 By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.
16053 This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go - great beer and great food to go with it.
16054 I can't believe I haven't taken the time to review it yet...
16055 The Beer: pretty consistently awesome.
16056 All the beers are at least "good," my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs (Hop Knot and Raj).
16057 I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated, but still pretty solid, and worth a try.
16058 I've been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales, but they always seem to be out, probably indicative of the quality of those selections.
16059 The Food: fantastic!
16060 I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks.
16061 The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with the Chicken Fingers, Chicken Salad Pita, or really any of their sandwiches.
16062 The fries are also great here - there's a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.
16063 Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.
16064 A little more liquidy than your average hummus, but really good.
16065 It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer.
16066 Bottom line, if you live in Phoenix, like beer, and enjoy eating a good meal, then you should be shot if you don't like Four Peaks.
16067 If you haven't been yet, do yourself a favor and try it.
16068 You'll come away happy, I promise.
16069 I've been going here many years.
16070 The food is always very, very good.
16071 Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent.
16072 Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.
16073 I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for.
16074 omg...
16075 I love this place the food is great, the selection is great, the staff is very helpful.
16076 This  is a great place to go have a few drinks and great stir fry.
16077 I love this place.
16078 The family is very sweet and the food is real deal homecooked Cuban food ... as good as I remember eating in Havana.
16079 I love the Fricase de Pollo and my hubby loves the oxtail.
16080 The fruit juices/smoothies are delish too!
16081 What to choose, what to choose.
16082 Such difficult decisions!
16083 Seriously, this normally isn't a problem.
16084 Dispite the fact that I'm a libra, I'm very decisive.
16085 Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions ::diabolical laugh:: Still, this place consistently stumps me.
16086 Is it Tuesday?
16087 If yes, then I'm definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos.
16088 Otherwise, I'll start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad.
16089 To drink I'll have Agua Fresca de Sabor.
16090 Yes, I'm going to have an entre too, I mean I've already broken my diet, might as well :D
16091 I'll have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta.
16092 OMG, so many great options!
16093 Seriously, this normally isn't a problem.
16094 Oh well, I guess I'll just have to try everything.
16095 Next up, a euphoric food coma!
16096 Life is good.
16097 After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell.
16098 Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go.
16099 Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks.
16100 We did a 180 and walked right out.
16101 No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.
16102 Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai.
16103 my husband and i LOVE this place!
16104 no, we cannot afford to get our weekly groceries here (although it would be terrific if we could), but we view oakville as an excellent alternative to dining out on the weekend.
16105 the food is delicious (think deli, simplicity, quality ingredients), and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing!
16106 we found that if it's too crowded inside, then it's easy enough go outside to the awesome patio area to enjoy our beer and goodies :)
16107 HORRIBLE---no, NON-EXISTENT customer service!
16108 Which is a shame considering they have good pizza.
16109 I ordered 2 pizzas, wings, a 2 liter and extra ranch; an hour later, the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings.
16110 When I told him that the order was not complete, he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was "messed up".
16111 Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake.
16112 Problem was, I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for.
16113 I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word.
16114 I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct.
16115 I asked for the manager when they answered.
16116 The girl who answered said to someone in the background (without putting me on hold so I heard every word): "Someone wants a manager.
16117 I guess that is you."
16118 The  "manager" told her he didn't have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to do....uh- FYI buddy, customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them!!!!
16119 The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager, and I told her what had happened with my order.
16120 She offered to credit my card for the order.
16121 Only problem is, it takes 48 hours to process.
16122 So now I am out $40 for the next few days, I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner, and I was treated horribly by not one (delivery driver) but two (manager) Mama Mia employees.
16123 I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely, she apologetically agreed.
16124 I asked for the contact information of the owner; if this were my business, I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt.
16125 She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.
16126 I never received a call.
16127 Apparently, the "customers are not important" tone is set at the top in this business.
16128 There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix, save yourself the hassle and the headache, order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service.
16129 I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.
16130 Another excellent burger, I have to say!
16131 Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill!
16132 Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.
16133 It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!
16134 A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience.
16135 So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.
16136 This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.
16137 Everything seemed promising .
16138 .
16139 .
16140 we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.
16141 Then .
16142 .
16143 .
16144 disappointment.
16145 The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.
16146 Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.
16147 We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there.
16148 I went for both breakfast & dinner two days in a row.
16149 I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous - didn't think such simple ingredients could blow my mind.
16150 I came back for dinner and got the kale & quiona salad - again - very simple, but amazing.
16151 I need to come back and get the pizza!
16152 Simply the best automotive repair place I've yet found in Phoenix.
16153 Honest, fair, and competent.
16154 I've taken three vehicles there for service over several years now and never been dissatisfied.
16155 2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent.
16156 The service is fast and attentive and the food great.
16157 The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ...
16158 So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty.
16159 The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines.
16160 Haven't made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ...
16161 Review #800
16162 I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800.
16163 Enter: Parent morning movies... in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating, VIP rooms, 21+ beverages, good food service, incredibly friendly staff, and caramel popcorn.
16164 I'm in!!
16165 Oh, and did I mention it's a beautiful, clean theater, too?
16166 WHO: All mommies, daddies, and other care-givers
16167 WHAT:  Go see a movie with your lil one!
16168 WHEN: Wednesday mornings and occasional featured nights.
16169 WHERE:  Listings for participating Ultra Star theaters are here... http://www.ultrastarmovies.com/parent_movie_morning.asp
16170 HOW: Because Ultra Star theater is AWESOME.
16171 WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that it's a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75!
16172 I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.
16173 It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasn't a parent.
16174 haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.
16175 All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.
16176 We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.
16177 Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.
16178 It's been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!
16179 See ya there!
16180 Went there first thing thing this morning.
16181 Ordered 2 simple sandwiches.
16182 Took over 35 minutes to make.
16183 6 workers lounging around.
16184 Completely ignored.
16185 Totally disgusted with their service.
16186 Overpriced.
16187 Food okay and felt worthless when I left
16188 I have been going here for years.
16189 I love the "Hong Kong" style pan fried crispy noodles!
16190 I've been a patient of Dr Lienau's since I was six years old!
16191 I usually don't care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, there's no way in heck I would switch.
16192 I even referred a co-worker to him recently!
16193 He's very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.
16194 Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!
16195 One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!)
16196 and is also a very friendly woman.
16197 I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!
16198 dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!
16199 she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.
16200 they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.
16201 we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.
16202 we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.
16203 it's a 45 minute drive for us now that we've moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my child's health.
16204 my first time here at blue 32 was great.
16205 i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic!
16206 service was friendly and fast.
16207 Best selection of raw and dehydrated food around.
16208 Very helpful personnel, friendly.
16209 Will shop here each time I vacation here with my dog.
16210 We'll take this over Godiva any day!
16211 The staff is always so friendly and they're always nice enough to give my kids (all 4) a sample, too.
16212 Nothing compares to their chocolates, especially the the vanilla milk chocolate, Brown Sugar Milk Chocolate and Coconut Milk Chocolate!
16213 Don't forget the lollipops that last FOREVER for the kids!!
16214 Just make sure you have a few wipes on hand!
16215 It's a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.
16216 Good food too.
16217 It's actually not nearly as bad inside as you'd think, it's pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldn't mind eating there.
16218 They have a few tables set up inside.
16219 I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).
16220 MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!
16221 I'm also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.
16222 I don't care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, I've found a new Mexican fix for lunch.
16223 What a happy day.
16224 I used to work here back when it was a Harkins.
16225 It's way better now.
16226 Comfortable, friendly, laid-back.
16227 Kind of decorated in a golden age of hollywood style.
16228 I dig it.
16229 I stumbled across this restaurant several years ago after becoming frustrated with the generally 2 hour wait, (no matter what day) at a DIFFERENT pizza restaurant in Heritage square, downtown Phoenix.
16230 Although the pizza was terrific at that "other" restaurant in Heritage square, I had a pretty UNBELIEVABLE experience....I was with a date, we waited the 2+ hours, had a really good dinner, salad, an appetizer and pizza.
16231 We decided we wanted another pizza and when we asked our server for another, we were told that we could not because there was a line of people waiting to get in.
16232 I was amazed.
16233 We left knowing we would NEVER go back.
16234 I heard about La Piazza al Forno not long after that experience.....I truly believe things happen for a reason.
16235 The pizza was even better and has been consistant ever since.
16236 The service was very warm and friendly, literally like a family welcoming me into their home.
16237 I learned that night, that it was one big family run business.
16238 Oh and by the way, the best...did I say BEST pizza that I not only have had in AZ, but NY has nothing over them!
16239 Icing on the cake, the prices are VERY reasonable!
16240 I GOTTA have a fix every 10 days!
16241 For the longest time I didn't want to tell anyone about my secret, however, they DESERVE to be known!
16242 AWESOME!!
16243 !
16244 Wow!
16245 This place is amazing.
16246 So amazing I went there twice in a week.
16247 I will start with my dinner.
16248 The ambiance was great.
16249 The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.
16250 They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.
16251 It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.
16252 They also had ample heat lamps.
16253 The food was fantastic.
16254 I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.
16255 I had the burger and tender belly bacon.
16256 This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.
16257 The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.
16258 It was a perfect complement for each other.
16259 I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore.
16260 The drinks were great.
16261 They have an amazing wine selection.
16262 The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.
16263 They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.
16264 My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.
16265 They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.
16266 Service was amazing as well.
16267 They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.
16268 Lunch
16269 The lunch was just as good as the dinner.
16270 I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.
16271 I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr.
16272 Pibb on tap.
16273 It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.
16274 The service was excellent.
16275 Overall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.
16276 It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.
16277 Mexican places like this need to be judged based on consistency - here's what I mean:
16278 42% of the time I've been hungover
16279 30% of the time I've been drunk
16280 22% of the time I've been sober
16281 6%   of the time (other)
16282 Food tastes great no matter what, and it's right down the street.
16283 Along with pretty much everyone else who has left a review for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE.
16284 I grew up in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out (my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews).
16285 I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical "hole in the wall" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL.
16286 The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great.
16287 I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good.
16288 You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu.
16289 I've gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too.
16290 I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off.
16291 I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.
16292 They can't find my house.
16293 It's not hard to find, I swear.
16294 It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad.
16295 They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called.
16296 Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.
16297 Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line.
16298 Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza.
16299 Apology accepted.
16300 Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings.
16301 Suckers.
16302 Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday.
16303 Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up.
16304 Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it.
16305 Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza.
16306 I even tip nicely.
16307 I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again.
16308 I will encourage my friends to follow suit.
16309 RAWR.
16310 By now you've heard the adventures at the Rustler's Roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zc_g ).
16311 But my adventures in Phoenix didn't end there.
16312 My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great "Q."
16313 He was convinced that AZ would have great "Q" on every corner.
16314 Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time.
16315 Anyway, I'll press on.
16316 We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot.
16317 I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven.
16318 This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted.
16319 Of course I'm in heaven and BGF is grousing about the "Q" not being any good.
16320 Now I've listened to this all week from him.
16321 - This Q is too Spicy
16322 - This Q is too wet
16323 - This Q won't fall off the bone
16324 - This Q doesn't have the right flavor.
16325 I'll admit it, I snapped.
16326 (And I didn't forgive him for about 2 weeks).
16327 I went up one side and down the other.
16328 If you don't like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff.
16329 Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss.
16330 Boss was actually laughing at us.
16331 Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I don't know why, it wasn't a rooster - oops, I digress).
16332 Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down.
16333 I love this restaurant.
16334 I really enjoy the reverse happy hour from 10pm-12am after I see a movie.
16335 The appetizers are 1/2 price and they have some really good drink specials- better if you are a lady.
16336 l like sitting out of the patio and relaxing.
16337 The sushi rolls are good.
16338 So are the avocado eggrolls.
16339 Before I was a vegetarian the only thing I would order was the macademia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a creamy soy sauce.
16340 It is what you would expect from any themed place called "Heart Attack Grill".
16341 Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the "nurses" wear at the bar.
16342 Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.
16343 Hamburgers are named after cardiac events.
16344 The food was bad, greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before.
16345 If you plan on going, enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again.
16346 Great variety.
16347 Great price!
16348 Beats other buffets in the East Valley.
16349 We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.
16350 It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.
16351 The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.
16352 They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.
16353 They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.
16354 I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.
16355 The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.
16356 We'll likely be dropping by here in the future.
16357 Great place!
16358 I love that they feature wines from "the little guys."
16359 You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.
16360 Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!
16361 The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!
16362 Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.
16363 I'll be back for sure!
16364 I'd give it about a 4.5, but I like rounding up for local businesses!
16365 The owner has been in there every time I've shown up, and the food comes out hot.
16366 The prices are spot on what you'd expect to pay, and so is the quality.
16367 I'm not from Chicago, and have only been there a couple times, so I wouldn't be able to speak to its authenticity - but I can speak to its taste and the great customer service the crew provides every time.
16368 If you're in the neighborhood and thinking about a hot dog, burger, fried zuccini, italian beef sandwich, or chicken burger, skip Sonic and DQ - they can't touch this place with a 15-yard drive-thru window.
16369 Best muffler shop in town.
16370 There are VERY few shops that I trust, and Mighty Muffler is one of them.
16371 Greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job.
16372 If there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem, no questions asked.
16373 Aiello's is my favorite Italian spot in the Valley.
16374 In fact, I day dream about the Mushroom Ravioli Special - you can taste the love in this dish.
16375 Great ambiance and a wonderful experience.
16376 The staff are always attentive and professional.
16377 The Owner makes a stop or two to make sure you're having a good time and they even let chance decide who pays for dinner, you or the house!
16378 Helpful hint:  Try no to get stuffed on the tasty bread and hot peppers served before the entree, you're going to want to finish it!
16379 I've been here a couple of times.
16380 The first time was on first fridays.
16381 I expected it to be packed, but I was able to walk right in and be seated.
16382 They had a table reserved and they must not have shown, so we lucked out.
16383 I got the Sante Fe, a roast beef panini, and it was great.
16384 They had some good beers on tap too.
16385 Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich.
16386 The second time I came here it was after a concert.
16387 There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear, but the meal was still good and I liked it.
16388 Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect, especially since the kitchen doesn't close until 12:30
16389 I still want to live here.
16390 It's quite possibly the only vegan restaurant I could see myself flying here to eat at then going home.
16391 I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:
16392 Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.
16393 Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color).
16394 This place is a dream.
16395 Designer blouses for $17.00.
16396 Seven jeans and Hudson jeans for $20.
16397 Steve Madden shoes for $25.
16398 I could go on... the store is beautiful, well-organized and full of things that are in perfect or near-perfect condition.
16399 Some items are still quite pricey, but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced.
16400 If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion, you will probably find it here.
16401 The employees are nice, friendly, helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well.
16402 Love it!
16403 I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary!
16404 SICK!
16405 I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.
16406 The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!
16407 AWFUL!!!
16408 HORRIBLE!!!!
16409 !
16410 IT was just HORRIBLE experience!
16411 I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am.
16412 There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10.
16413 I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away!
16414 only cash she said!!
16415 And ask me to go to ATM to get cash!
16416 I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad.
16417 Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.
16418 She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!!
16419 everything was done in 10 min!
16420 She didnt even the nails, didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file.
16421 Her work was so nigligent in everything!
16422 Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips.
16423 I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :"Pretty?
16424 Yes?"
16425 It was so far from looking pretty!
16426 I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful!
16427 And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me
16428 Her pedi was not better at all!!
16429 She was always in a hurry!
16430 She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me!
16431 I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!!
16432 She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!!
16433 I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!
16434 The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger!
16435 OMG!
16436 I wanted to cry!
16437 It's the worse mani and pedi I've ever gotten in my entire life, and I do it every month!
16438 !
16439 I wish I had a reciept and could get back to talk to the manager -but this lady just took my 45 bucks and left me with ugly!
16440 really ugly work!!
16441 !
16442 Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!
16443 Here's how my experience went ...
16444 Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?"
16445 Employee: "No"
16446 .... dead air ...
16447 Me: "Ummm why not?"
16448 Employee: "We don't have carmel"
16449 Me: "Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then"
16450 Employee: "Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino"
16451 Me: "Okay" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).
16452 So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon.
16453 To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho.
16454 What a complete and utter douche bag.
16455 Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!
16456 ).
16457 This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown.
16458 Guess what?
16459 I'm not going to check them out.
16460 Fuck you Cartel.
16461 You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.
16462 Complete FAIL.
16463 For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail.
16464 Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees.
16465 And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.
16466 ----
16467 please read "owners comment" below ... here's my response ...
16468 ----
16469 Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ...
16470 I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ...
16471 By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point.
16472 I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!
16473 This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first.
16474 The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak.
16475 Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.
16476 It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters.
16477 Check 'em out you won't be disappointed!
16478 Open Range offers some damn-good home cooking.
16479 My family eats here often and has never had a bad meal.
16480 Not to mention that the portions are huge.
16481 I usually order the cobb salad.
16482 From a typical deli, I'd normally expect iceberg lettuce, a handful of shaved carrots, some egg, and a little bit of bacon.
16483 But if that were the case, I wouldn't be ordering the salad again and again.
16484 The field greens and romaine lettuce are served with avocado (I'm pretty sure they use at least 1/2 an avocado for each salad), artichoke hearts, tomatoes, bacon (no bacon bits here!
16485 ), radishes, blue cheese, egg, cucumbers  and I'm sure i'm forgetting something else, but it is GOOD.
16486 Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically.
16487 It's unbelievable.)
16488 I'd also recommend the Arizona caviar (black bean salad) or southwest coleslaw.
16489 My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches (with choice of homemade barbecue sauce - each one better than the last), my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes (better than grandma's), and grandpa loves whatever is on special.
16490 Even my picky-eater brother loves food at Open Range - and that's saying something!
16491 Bethany and Tom are the owners; Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that he's in charge of most of the barbecuein'.
16492 (He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA, they were GOOD.)
16493 The restaurant (as the name suggests) has a full service deli too, in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal.
16494 In the past, the service has been slow, but it has improved dramatically over the past year.
16495 The restaurant has a killer view of the Superstition Mountains, and is within 10 - 20 minutes of countless hiking trails.
16496 To make this long review short: if you're looking for a tastes-like-home (or tastes-better-than-home) cooked meal and you're in the far east valley, make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner.
16497 You'll probably see my family and me chowing down too.
16498 One of the perks to being an only child, is "me" time.
16499 There is something special about having time to yourself, when the only obligation you have is to check in on Yelp, leave a quick tip, and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside.
16500 Yesterday was that day.
16501 I had stumbled across The Art of Shaving.
16502 I've been in their stores in other cities before.
16503 Of course I have...because if you look at any of my pictures, you will realize a couple things: 1.
16504 I'm vain.
16505 2.
16506 I'm hairless.
16507 As soon as you step foot into this store, you are in a true gentleman's club.
16508 Not the kind that will take all your dollar bills.
16509 You won't make it rain here.
16510 This is the ultimate shaving store.
16511 Soaps, creams, blades, razors, balms, brushes, and mugs.
16512 You name it, they have it.
16513 The staff knows what they are talking about.
16514 I explained to them that I have a very old safety razor and a brush.
16515 Both were passed down by my Grandfather who passed away when I was a teenager.
16516 They didn't pressure me into buying ANYTHING, although I did end up leaving with some shaving cream.
16517 They even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush.
16518 I've been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creams....so the little tutorial was nice.
16519 Also, there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves, haircuts, and men's facials.
16520 Remember earlier when I said that "me" time is a perk?
16521 This is the best place to spend it if you are a dude.
16522 If you are a woman, buy your man, or your man-friend a gift from here.
16523 This place is simply amazing.
16524 One last warning.
16525 The store is pricey.
16526 but worth every single penny.
16527 This location has closed.
16528 Went by today and found an empty restaurant.
16529 Just left.
16530 I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good.
16531 The Biagga was fantastic.
16532 Probably the best prosciutto style pizza I've ever had.
16533 Owner and staff were very friendly.
16534 I will be back again.
16535 If I were ever to be executed, I'd want a Meat & Cheese pasty for my last meal.
16536 With two red wine gravy.
16537 It's *that* good.
16538 we keep driving by this place thinking it was just a coffee house.
16539 but after reading some of yelps reviews, learned it was much more.
16540 it's so cute and trendy inside.
16541 they have so many yummy and healthy options, we didn't know what to pick.
16542 so we decided to go with the veggie breakfast burrito.
16543 it was light and filling, much to our surprise.
16544 and superbly tasty.
16545 and best of all, not gigantic.
16546 more places should do that....offer reasonably priced food, that tastes great, in manageable portions.
16547 that way, you don't stuff your face with a giant food plate and then feel like an obese slob the rest of the morning.
16548 we'll hit this place up again for sure.
16549 awesome staff too!!!
16550 !
16551 Perhaps you've heard of the Library of Congress.
16552 Nice Library.
16553 Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room.
16554 Wil Bruder was the Architect.
16555 You either love his work, or you hate his work.
16556 I love his work!
16557 And, this library is as good as it gets.
16558 Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon *on* the Summer Solstice.
16559 Ask a librarian:  They'll tell you why.
16560 [ah, the mystery....]
16561 I've got two names for you:  TYLER & MARCO - - superstar instructors at the Y!!
16562 !
16563 I've been an avid gym member at various gyms for years and I have to say, the YMCA downtown can't be beat for the 8-5 p.m. work schedule person who likes to attend the gym during lunch or right after work.
16564 I'm all about the group exercise classes and this Y offers an array of classes such as spin, kickboxing, Zumba, Yogalates, Boot camp, water aerobics, Hatha Yoga, etc., etc.
16565 Back to my fav instructors:  Tyler and Marco.
16566 Boy, do these boys kick my ass every time I take their classes!
16567 Tyler teaches spin and offers not only strong knowledge and great tips on making your spin experience the best that it can be, he has a kick-ass playlist of music to motivate his class.
16568 Marco is a very intense and interactive kickboxing instructor who keeps pushing you with great music mixes to keep his class sweating the weight and stress away.
16569 Thank you Tyler and Marco for making my workouts intense and fun!
16570 After years of going to different aerobic classes, I'm FINALLY seeing the results!
16571 !
16572 P.S.
16573 You can't beat the staff that works there.
16574 Erica who manages all the group exercise instructor welcomes any suggestions or comments with a smile.
16575 Freddie at the front desk is also very helpful and sweet.
16576 Love this place!
16577 Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.
16578 Ate here 3 times.
16579 The squid salad is amazing!
16580 They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.
16581 Must try!
16582 I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious.
16583 I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare; the quality of the meat is unbelievable.
16584 Love the sweet fries; I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries.
16585 Outdoor shopping at its best... probably not the best if its hot outside- but great outdoor dining and misters... :-)
16586 You know the story about the cobbler who created all those adorable shoes for the elves in the village?
16587 Ok, so maybe that story doesn't go exactly like that.
16588 Regardless, I found Old Town Scottsdale's version of the magical cobbler who can do wonders with shoes and I found it at Tony's Shoe Repair!
16589 Here, Tony keeps shoes in spic and span condition and if you bring them in looking anything but shiny and new, you can be sure they will be returned as good as new.
16590 Tony's Shoe Repair also handles purses and belts.
16591 They do everything for a shoe including simple repairs such as widening and adding those little tricky bottom parts of heels that never seem to last, to giving your worn our shoes an entire face lift.
16592 The prices here are reasonable and he does the work for you in a speedy time frame.
16593 I dropped off my sad looking boots off and he freshened them up and added new heel bottoms to them in a day's time.
16594 The fairytales can keep their magical cobblers, here in the real world we've got something even better -- Tony's Shoe Repair!
16595 How many great things can one say about the Cartel?
16596 Does Infinity work!
16597 Yes, that was a statement, not a question.
16598 I am in love with the CC, hands down.
16599 I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day.
16600 The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing.
16601 They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction.
16602 The hot drinks, A+++ as well.
16603 And, the food?
16604 A+++++ (5, yup its that legit).
16605 Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven.
16606 No joke.
16607 Heaven.
16608 Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course!
16609 Not those nasty rain clouds.
16610 OK, maybe not clouds.
16611 But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel.
16612 And not because you live in AZ.
16613 Duh.
16614 Only complaint I have is the hours.
16615 I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho).
16616 PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!!
16617 I'll work for free!
16618 Well...wait...
16619 I'll come visit.
16620 Cute, cozy, pleasant and very friendly service.
16621 That is really all I have to say about them.
16622 The food was oh so delicious!
16623 Little bite sized tacos.
16624 Service was fast and just perfect!
16625 They even use the square card reader on their iPad to charge cards.
16626 Which truly shows its a small and quaint restaurant.
16627 I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions.
16628 I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes.
16629 I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me.
16630 He even got me into my own car once.
16631 At the drop of a hat, he is there for me.
16632 His knowledge is excellent, his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent.
16633 I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town.
16634 In which case I would probably ask him to come home.
16635 :) Use this guy.
16636 Hes great.
16637 My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh.
16638 There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant.
16639 This place is great.
16640 The first time I went in I didn't have change for the parking meter and they easily helped me out.
16641 Adrian cut my hair and did a great job.
16642 Everyone was friendly and made you feel welcome.
16643 Indiana University went to a bowl game for the first time in a crazy number of years.
16644 And my big little cousin is one of their defensive ends.
16645 So it was my pleasure to end 2007 watching the Hoosiers play the Cowboys of Oklahoma State University.
16646 I can't think of any better way to finish off what's been a crazy year...though it was improved by being joined in the stands by Nadia C. (soon-to-be G.) and her adorable fiance Ben.
16647 I don't understand football, so the game was kinda secondary for me, but being amongst all those screaming fans, and the cheerleaders and the band was great.
16648 I'd forgotten that energy since leaving my sports loving home town.
16649 But the game was pretty good.
16650 Would have been better if Kellen Lewis would have completed 60% or more of his passes.
16651 Or if the Hoosiers had won (hey coach....DEFENSE!).
16652 But football is pretty awesome from only 5 rows up.
16653 Add some people watching (guy in red pants and wig), constructive advice to the IU dance team (buy new uniforms...something along the lines of the sparkly orange dresses of the OSU girls), and the awesome Marching Hundred (who knew that mainstream marching bands play riding dirty).
16654 And we had a blast./
16655 The only downer was not being able to visit with my cousin after the game.
16656 For "security" reasons, they wouldnt let family and friends see the players at the stadium.
16657 Since I wasn't staying at the hotel, and didn't know what hotel that was, I wasn't able to see him.
16658 I was terribly disappointed to come all that way and not be able to give him a hug and give him a hard time about growing up to be a big burly football player.
16659 In my head, he's still 12 and  gangly, and trying to grow into his feet and his ears.
16660 But it's great to see that hes a "grown man", in college, playing football and playing for a team that's getting better every season.
16661 So GO BIG RED!
16662 And hopefully there will be another bowl visit to kick off 2009.
16663 We've take our daughter to Dr. Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital.
16664 I've seen all but one of the four doctors, and have been extremely pleased with all of them.
16665 They offer both a sick and well child waiting room.
16666 Our daughter loves the themed rooms.
16667 With small children, you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit.
16668 My child is two now, and we have never been unable to get an emergency/sick appointment.
16669 Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day.
16670 Anything they told us they were doing, was done as promised.
16671 I cannot recommend them highly enough!
16672 I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.
16673 What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.
16674 So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.
16675 We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!
16676 He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.
16677 Well moments later I found a hair in my food...
16678 I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!
16679 I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).
16680 I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).
16681 Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.
16682 All I got was "Oh, I'll check the guys in the back."
16683 Check the guys in the back???
16684 What?
16685 How about, sorry may I refund you your money?
16686 Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.
16687 Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.
16688 I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them.
16689 Oh AJ's...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200!
16690 They have so many different beers to choose from here.
16691 If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.
16692 If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place.
16693 From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if you're making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here.
16694 One day I'll be able to afford the prime steaks.
16695 This little joint is right down the street from my crib and I've had the chance to dine here on several occasions (take out and dine in).
16696 Each and every time its been great!
16697 Extremely fresh ingredients and even better prices!!
16698 Great local place to get some great grub on a small budget.
16699 Highly recommended!
16700 despite it's billing as the 'largest thrift store in north america,' i'm pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items.
16701 the place is huge, but i've never, ever found anything good in this store.
16702 i'm not sure how that's possible.
16703 but i would never go out of my way to shop here.
16704 i have no bathroom report for this location because i've never been in there long enough to actually go.
16705 My wife turned me on to this gem.
16706 Her family has been eating here since the 70's it never disappoints.
16707 The machaca is moist not wet like many others.
16708 The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere.
16709 I love this place!
16710 The owner is always there and you can tell he takes great pride in what he does.
16711 Great food and great customer service!
16712 The best fried calamari in Surprise!
16713 Delish pizza!
16714 Consistent quality and service, never have been disappointed since we moved here in June!
16715 I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.
16716 Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive...
16717 Best pizza in the valley that I've had (I've yet to do Pizzaria Banco).
16718 Great service, always made fast, and GREAT pricing...doens't travel well, so if you're gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldn't recommend it...I think that's why there's a lot of "soggy crust" comments etc...
16719 Best pizza in AZ, hands down.
16720 I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.
16721 The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.
16722 To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.
16723 I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!
16724 I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy.
16725 It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy.
16726 They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious.
16727 Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at.
16728 Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal.
16729 They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog!
16730 We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!
16731 Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything.
16732 Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area.
16733 I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it.
16734 Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had.
16735 All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food.
16736 I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me.
16737 She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions.
16738 I'll be back here soon!
16739 Great spa...
16740 If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you.
16741 Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room!
16742 I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional.
16743 Outstanding customer service too.
16744 I cannot get enough of LGO.
16745 My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.
16746 The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO.
16747 Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold.
16748 The lunch and dinner options are great too.
16749 This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.
16750 The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded.
16751 That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it.
16752 The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.
16753 LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly.
16754 4.5 stars!
16755 I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of "market-made granola" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.
16756 Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!
16757 This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.
16758 (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)
16759 I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!
16760 Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.
16761 After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!
16762 ), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!
16763 (I'm hoping, anyway!)
16764 p.s.
16765 Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.
16766 One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!
16767 Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!
16768 Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market?
16769 ?
16770 Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt.
16771 Delish!!!!!!
16772 x 100!
16773 !
16774 Love, love, love this place.
16775 This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure.
16776 My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food.
16777 Their spring rolls are so yummy!
16778 The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book!
16779 Everything on the menu is delicious, though I haven't tried is all, I'm sure it is!
16780 Went here tonight with the padres and husband.
16781 This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.
16782 We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert.
16783 Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal.
16784 We started with the Hummus + olives appetizer.
16785 Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty, husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado.
16786 I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious!
16787 !
16788 There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings.
16789 There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees, as well as some sweet stuff.
16790 There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill, as well as pasta, pure vanilla extract and other items.
16791 I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh, home-cooked meal.
16792 I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time.
16793 I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what?
16794 flies followed me inside too.
16795 I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!
16796 Enjoyed date night here with the hubby.
16797 Try the gluten free pizza.
16798 A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!
16799 Mmmmmmm
16800 As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate, I love Ethiopian food.
16801 And now that I work in northern Tempe, I'm here all the time.
16802 It's filling, flavorful and inexpensive.
16803 I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10.
16804 If you, like me, think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth, definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile.
16805 This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport.
16806 I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos.
16807 I've said it before and I'll say it again here: this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food.
16808 Eat here before your next flight!
16809 I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees.
16810 I have had my ears pierced at Claire's when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!)
16811 and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo.
16812 I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading.
16813 The place is clean and every one is friendly.
16814 I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another.
16815 Thank you!
16816 Check this out...I JUST HAD A RUBEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!
16817 !
16818 I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper.
16819 We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake9/11/10 and wanted to stop for breakfast.
16820 We had the dogs with us so choices were limited.
16821 My boyfriend went into Stan's and they let us sit on the patio with the pups.
16822 They serve their entire menu all day.
16823 I'm not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning.
16824 I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress (who was fabulous) to choose the side.
16825 The food took a little while to arrive.
16826 When it did...Holy Cow!!
16827 !
16828 My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all.
16829 That is great customer service!
16830 My favorite was the slaw, then potato salad.
16831 The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating.
16832 The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile.
16833 I will no doubt be back.
16834 Thank you so much Stan's for the wonderful start to my day!
16835 We have been here now several times.
16836 This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to.
16837 The food and service is absolutely the best.
16838 Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen.
16839 Everything off the grill is awesome.
16840 The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience.
16841 Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:
16842 For one, if you don't mind spending the money the toro "tour" is great.
16843 They have something like 5 different kinds of toro.
16844 From real fatty to a little less.
16845 Melts in your mouth.
16846 The presentation is very impressive.
16847 It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.
16848 All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared
16849 The steak is excellent.
16850 The flavor is spectacular,  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked, always and without fail, exactly to you specification.
16851 All tempura dishes are great
16852 Grilled zucchini....
16853 Very good and juicy.
16854 Seabass with miso.
16855 Cooked perfectly.
16856 I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter.
16857 It makes for a very good experience.
16858 This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost.
16859 Just go for it, tske your time and experience it all.
16860 It will make for a very good experience.
16861 Try their very unique drinks, they are very refreshing.
16862 Or, if you are real daring, the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience.
16863 Did it once.
16864 It's a bit long for us and wont do it again.
16865 Love the pita jungle!!!
16866 My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.
16867 Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.
16868 Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.
16869 You can't go wrong here.
16870 A must when you visit the Heard.
16871 The staff is very professional.
16872 James, Lora and Allison are excellent.
16873 The shop is first class.
16874 Great place for a collector.
16875 Some of the finest Native American art available.
16876 Highly recommend a visit.
16877 You will be amazed.
16878 Great flavors even though there aren't many to choose from!
16879 Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping!
16880 I visit as often as I can!
16881 !
16882 Great facial great customer service
16883 One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.
16884 Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting.
16885 I love the way it's decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website.
16886 The decor is white, clean, girly and classic.
16887 I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too.
16888 When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!
16889 She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome!
16890 The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using.
16891 Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in.
16892 Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!
16893 The best street taco's i've had.
16894 As authentic and cheap as it gets...
16895 If you do take out, pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well, its really hot, but tasty.
16896 Don't tell me ATF or any other spot is better, they dont come close unless you like your "street tacos" with sour cream, cheese and lettuce LOL.
16897 I love Jimmy Johns!
16898 I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.
16899 Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me.
16900 I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.
16901 I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas.
16902 I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.
16903 I will not be going here for future tire needs.
16904 The music is pounding...
16905 It reeks of ridiculously strong cologne masking young adult male insecurity...
16906 Some guy younger than my kid brother is walking around without a shirt...
16907 Everything is super overpriced for what you get...
16908 In the grand tradition of overcompensation and brand whoring there is a name plastered all over everything...
16909 No one is genuine either in their efforts to help or able to make real eye contact and stop texting...
16910 Is it a bar in Belltown in the late 90s?
16911 Is it a frat party?
16912 Is it a spring break trip?
16913 No, it's Pimpercrombie & Bitch!
16914 Now I remember why it had been at least ten years since the last time I walked in one of these cesspools of humanity and child labor sweatshops.
16915 Maybe next time I will wait 20 years...if they make it that long.
16916 Torn between review Fez Foodies, the periodic event that allows patrons to participate in sampling yet-to-be-added menu item and tweak them based on responses and the actual restaurant that hosts said event and providing a CenPho restaurant that combines innovative cuisine with ambiance and amazing service, I settled on the latter.
16917 Because without the brick-and-mortar there would be no former.
16918 So, tonight for the first time Robert M and I joined the Fez Foodies for a sneak peak at a few items that will be coming to a plate near you.
16919 The raspberry spinach salad was wonderful.
16920 The steak with mushrooms and smashed red potatoes might need another consideration but was still a pleasant entree.
16921 Honestly, I look forward to returning and getting these items, because Fez actually takes customer input/suggestions and applies them.
16922 Fez is one of those locations where I've never gotten anything but terrific service and a great meal.
16923 I'm fond of the garlic and rosemary fries but my coworkers and friends and strangers on the light rail think I should limit myself on these as some people don't appreciate the proven medical benefits of bucket-loads of garlic and shovelfuls of rosemary.
16924 Tools.
16925 Not surprisingly, Thomas was a peach of a host.
16926 Forgive me if I seemed disinterested in conversation: we just returned from Rim Country and that experience killed my ass.
16927 Ahhh Shady's...I am a little embarrassed to admit how often I frequent this gem of a place, but definitely not ashamed of how much I love it.
16928 Cool atmosphere, just the right lighting (very important to me), great bartenders, good prices on a really nice selection (Who else has Old Raj gin or Agwa De Bolivia?).
16929 This is definitely not a dive bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), but it's not an icey, blase Snobbsdale-ish joint either, and I've never felt ridiculed or snubbed here either by patron or bartender.
16930 I've seen all walks of life come through this place, but never felt that it was too 'hip' or pretentious in any way.
16931 Great jukebox, obscure, forgotten movies playing on the telly, bartenders that are nice to look at (male and female), have personality and actually remember your name (and drink).
16932 Does it get any better than this?
16933 I really enjoy this place.
16934 It's beautifully designed.
16935 It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic!
16936 ---What else does one need?
16937 But now the food.
16938 Rich, full flavored, comfort food.
16939 I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around.
16940 Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome.
16941 A potato side dish, damn good I tell you.
16942 For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time.
16943 This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix.
16944 Seriously.
16945 Excellent!
16946 I love this place!
16947 Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person.
16948 The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise.
16949 they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on.
16950 And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games.
16951 It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again.
16952 Okay ya wanna know a little secret?
16953 I LONG for Green.
16954 Ever since moving back to New Orleans I'm surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green.
16955 I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant.
16956 Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better.
16957 The staff was warmer and the food just as good.
16958 I'm still thinking about the "crab" puffs and the eggless rolls.
16959 As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!
16960 Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.
16961 If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.
16962 If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.
16963 :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.
16964 Their other dishes are consistently good as well.
16965 I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.
16966 Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.
16967 Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.
16968 Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.
16969 A must if you're eating anything spicy.
16970 The service is very professional and timely.
16971 The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.
16972 It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.
16973 All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.
16974 I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.
16975 It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.
16976 You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.
16977 One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.
16978 Highly recommended!
16979 ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.
16980 Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.
16981 Wow.
16982 Wow, I am very impressed.
16983 The store is very big, and they seem to have it all - even the hard to find, odd items.
16984 It looks like everyone can shop here.
16985 The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too.
16986 Finding things is easy, and if you can't (or don't want to) the very friendly staff are there to help.
16987 It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also... so whether you are looking for: digestive health, immune support, weight loss, muscle building, herbs, beauty or whatever; they have it, and they can tell you about it!
16988 Pretty Good!
16989 You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff.
16990 And they can track your purchases with it should you ever (like me) loose your receipt!
16991 What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy.
16992 I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt.
16993 Especially, since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either.
16994 I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange.
16995 Well, the clerk was so nice to me.
16996 She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money (I didn't even ask for a refund)... and I had opened one product.
16997 I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too - since it was almost a month that had passed (I really didn't think they'd take them back).
16998 Anyway, I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated, and she said, "No problem:-)" again!
16999 So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed.
17000 They had them and they had them on sale - cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too.
17001 Needless to say, I walked out of there very happy (but feeling a bit undeserving).
17002 But that is what good - EXCELLENT - customer service is all about - exceeding the customer's expectations!
17003 This I my new store for all of my supplements and health & wellness needs.
17004 I recommend checking them out.
17005 They seem to have everything one could ever need.
17006 Plus, they have an entire wall (and more) dedicated to muscle, weight and fitness - if that is your thing!
17007 Also be sure to check out their website; they even have customer reviews & ratings!
17008 and product information/facts and ingredients.
17009 Really Cool!
17010 I love this place!!!
17011 The first time I went I fell in love with their fries and their secret sauce.
17012 They have those great crinkle fries and they are made to order so they come out super crispy and hot.
17013 They alone can stand on their own but I have to have the sauce.
17014 It has to be a mixture of ketchup, mayo probably some chili powder and some other stuff that I can't figure out.
17015 No matter how many times I try to do it at home I never get it.
17016 Once before I got the Italian Beef but being my first time I didn't know that you could get it wet... Duh... and ended up eating a warm roast beef sandwich that was a bit on the dry side.
17017 After reading the Yelp reviews I realized that you can add all kinds of stuff to it.
17018 I think that the girl at the register should've at least informed me that I had options.
17019 The staff (girls at the register) weren't all too friendly which makes for a less than pleasant experience right from the start.
17020 Hopefully they aren't there anymore.
17021 Forward to today I decided to give it another shot and I am so glad I did.
17022 The owner is a really cool guy and is always super nice when I come in.
17023 He asked me all the questions about how I wanted the sandwich and put the dip in a to go cup for me so I wouldn't have a mush sandwich when I got home.
17024 I added provolone and hot giardiniera which absolutely made the sandwich.
17025 I didn't get to finish it because my other half smelled it and swooped in and polished it off and loved it too.
17026 Good thing I got the fries!
17027 I would highly recommend this place.
17028 If you do have the Italian Beef you should try to eat it there instead of taking it home.
17029 If you get embarrassed easily or worry about food all over your hands and face then don't eat this infront of other people.
17030 I think it once you eat it you won't even care if it gets in your hair.
17031 So I say get over it and get your butt down to Lobbys and eat til you explode!
17032 Love it.
17033 Wish it was in my neighborhood.
17034 I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location.
17035 Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.
17036 Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.
17037 I ordered the Morning Monte.
17038 It was delicious.
17039 My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.
17040 My favorite item was the chorizo burro.
17041 Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.
17042 The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also.
17043 Another really great thing about this place is the prices.
17044 I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.
17045 Very reasonable for the good quality food you get.
17046 After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.
17047 We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.
17048 I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.
17049 This place has amazing frozen yogurt!
17050 I had the strawberry with small pieces of fresh strawberries!
17051 It was a wonderful treat in this heat, since it's yogurt and not ice cream, it's a little bit healthier.
17052 I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter.
17053 Every time I have been here the place is filthy.
17054 I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.
17055 The food is just not good in any way anymore.
17056 Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content.
17057 What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese?
17058 It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse.
17059 Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning.
17060 Just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is.
17061 They've got soda, lots of soda.
17062 That's right, I said soda!
17063 They've got root beer, sarsaparilla, freaky foreign sodas, teas, waters and other things.
17064 I love this place, I have no complaints.
17065 The only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer.
17066 Man, if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of Topps  Liquors it would be unstopable!
17067 All I can say is DELICIOUS!!!
17068 Service was great, food was great ,and the restaurant looks beautiful.
17069 Fried Squash blossoms!
17070 How do they come up with this stuff?
17071 FnB gets 5 stars for creativity and service... oh, and the food is pretty amazing too!
17072 The menu changes with the season, so I apologize in advance for making your mouth water by mentioning  food you'll probably never taste.
17073 We started off with the appetizer special, Fried Squash blossoms stuffed with burrata served with fresh tomato sauce, and an order of naan with eggplant puree.
17074 The Naan plate was nothing special, but the blossoms were fantastic.
17075 For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto.
17076 The pasta was amazing, I watched the chef make my pesto to order... mmmm basil!
17077 Hottie devoured every bite, so I would say he enjoyed his chops too.
17078 For desert we shared the panna cotta with cherries, it was the perfect ending to a great meal.
17079 This place gets 5 starts all the way, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable and the food was superb.
17080 Thank you FnB
17081 best in the valley
17082 So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.
17083 The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount.
17084 Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill).
17085 "I get a 100% tips!"
17086 umm..yeah..
17087 I think I will skip this place for sure!
17088 Terrible food, terrible service.
17089 I ordered chicken fried rice.
17090 The waiter brings me a bowl and says, "chicken fried rice, right?"
17091 I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice.
17092 This must be a joke.
17093 I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken.
17094 I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along.
17095 So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.
17096 Or at least their version of it.
17097 I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice.
17098 The rice itself was cheap long grain rice.
17099 It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was.
17100 Like absolutely no water absorption.
17101 And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy.
17102 Disgusting.
17103 I have no idea how people can eat this.
17104 Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad.
17105 There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.
17106 The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink, which cost $1.85.
17107 The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents.
17108 Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful!
17109 I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible.
17110 They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention.
17111 I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!
17112 ?
17113 My wife and I found Four Peaks by chance.
17114 We got lucky.
17115 The food was great, service was great, and all thr beers rocked.
17116 My wife's fav was the Heff and the Arizona Peach.
17117 We got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler.
17118 I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years.
17119 I have to say the location kinda sucks, but that's because of all the traffic.
17120 Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?
17121 !
17122 Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today.
17123 Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread.
17124 The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow.
17125 Service can be slow there sometimes, it's best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd.
17126 Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!
17127 Navajo Food at it's best !!!!!!
17128 I loved everything there !
17129 I guess I love "BLAND" food .
17130 :-) everything was terrific ...
17131 I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING !
17132 I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda.
17133 He loved everything !
17134 Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!!
17135 I LOVED IT !
17136 Brought a friend from Louisiana here.
17137 She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!
17138 UPDATE: This location is closed.
17139 Boo!
17140 Wow.
17141 Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale.
17142 Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash.
17143 Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes.
17144 That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day!
17145 Best corned beef hash EVER!
17146 Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were?
17147 And damn pretty as well.
17148 Double score.
17149 The name says it all.
17150 This is one hot bagel shop!
17151 This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale.
17152 This bagel shop is delicious.
17153 The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious.
17154 This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason.
17155 The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for.
17156 The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning!
17157 I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch.
17158 A great restaurant staff!
17159 They go above and beyond for their customer.
17160 Try the buffet you will not be disappointed.
17161 Bacon is cooked to perfection.
17162 Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups.
17163 Found Indulge on a whim, based on their huge "Gluten-Free Menu" outside - I was not disappointed when we decided to try it!
17164 Indulge has a separate gluten-free menu and the server was very knowledgable walking me through their kitchen processes to reassure me.
17165 I ordered my burger on a gluten-free bun (!!!)
17166 the first time I was ever able to do this in a restaurant.
17167 That was EXCITING!
17168 I think Indulge is as good as you make it - you are given a menu to check off ingredients for your burger.
17169 They have SOOO many choices, that it's likely that if you don't like your burger, YOU made the wrong choice.
17170 I had no such problem - I loved my custom burger!
17171 It was cooked to the correct temperature, was delicious & best of all, was delivered on a tasty gluten-free bun.
17172 PLUS, though I was full (it was a LOT of food!)
17173 I was able to take a gluten-free cupcake to go - wow, was that ever heaven later!
17174 Thanks Indulge!
17175 Mellow Mushroom - WOW
17176 As you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade.
17177 Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.
17178 We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome.
17179 The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it.
17180 I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked.
17181 Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off.
17182 I'll be heading back...soon
17183 Pauli from ATL checking in here.... just for a bit of nostalgia...
17184 I used to live in Phoenix a few years back, and of all the places I miss eating at, this is #1 on my list.
17185 I remember how I first heard of the place....
17186 I was over at a friend's house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work, and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was.
17187 My friend, who had more than just a few beers in him, stared at me all glassy-eyed, got right in my face and said... "Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo!!"
17188 As I backed up a bit, thinking my friend had too much to drink (he had, for sure), I wondered... hmmm...the Chinese Bandit?
17189 What the hell is that place about?!?
17190 Or is he just f***ing with me?
17191 So, I asked him what kind of food they serve there... And, as he did his best to focus on me, when his eyes hit mine, there was this long pause.... and he had this expression on his face that I can't forget...
17192 I wasn't sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh***ing in his pants.
17193 And then he put his hands together, like a nutjob working a Rubik's cube.... and said, "They... dooo... things... like.... egg-foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss...."..... as he gave me another crazy-ass look (the kind that tells you it's time to say goodnight and get outta there - which I did)....
17194 So, a few days later, I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out.... And from that point on, I was hooked.
17195 Egg foo young burritos indeed!
17196 And jerk fried rice!
17197 And those refried black beans with fire-in-the-bungholio sauce mixed in.... Yep, those will burn you twice... All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish... And you got that combo, along with a soda and tip for about $10!!!
17198 WOW!
17199 !
17200 At that time, I had never seen anything like it before, and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix....
17201 I wish somebody would franchise one out to Atlanta - I would be the first customer in the door on opening day, guaranteed....
17202 Off the chainco's!
17203 lol
17204 Today my friends and I pondered what to eat.. a good sandwich was was we decided on but where?
17205 Looked right here on yelp and it came up.. most the reviews were good so we went for it.
17206 WOW.
17207 I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom.
17208 I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.
17209 Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.
17210 Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.
17211 I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.
17212 While eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain.. and should rename itself to "off the chainco's" lol
17213 Highly recommended and cant wait to take others here.
17214 -Shawn
17215 A chain, yes.
17216 But par for the course, no.
17217 First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto.
17218 In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content.
17219 So it's option is great for me.
17220 It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.
17221 Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole.
17222 Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge.
17223 This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount.
17224 The food, however, is absolutely worth it.
17225 We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious.
17226 It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time.
17227 The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint.
17228 We ate the "big night out" prix fix menu and chose the "Fusion" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken.
17229 We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth.
17230 Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil.
17231 The california salad was incredible.
17232 It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing.
17233 It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing.
17234 The chocolate we chose was the Smore.
17235 It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out.
17236 It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas.
17237 Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves.
17238 Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through.
17239 This is pretty normal for fondue.
17240 You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though.
17241 It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place.
17242 Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.
17243 Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.
17244 Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.
17245 The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.
17246 I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.
17247 Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.
17248 Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).
17249 As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.
17250 He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.
17251 The beans, who can complain?
17252 Jason made his name with the roasting.
17253 I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.
17254 Bread was fresh.
17255 Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.
17256 Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.
17257 Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!)
17258 and plenty of seating inside.
17259 As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.
17260 Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.
17261 My latest experience changes that.
17262 I'm happy to say that I've incorporated Guedo's into my weekly routine.
17263 The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spot-on.
17264 I've read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really don't mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses; especially a staple of the community like Guedo's.
17265 If you're looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name, come to Guedo's.
17266 Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!
17267 You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...
17268 I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices don't seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap...
17269 The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours...
17270 I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.
17271 I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there...
17272 This is a nice place for special occasions or a date...
17273 Pizza has been delicious and fresh every time I've been there.
17274 The Chipotle pasta is absolutely the best though.
17275 I love this place.
17276 They are so accommodating and the food is delicious.
17277 They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it.
17278 Our server was helpful and friendly.
17279 I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty.
17280 I can't wait to go back.
17281 The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.
17282 My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.
17283 I will never go back to that theater again.
17284 I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.
17285 i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO.
17286 breakfast, coffee ambiance, service, pizza - 5 stars.
17287 happy hour 3 stars.
17288 Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout, run, hike or... anything else at home in bed with your better half.
17289 must see for my visitors
17290 I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious.
17291 50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele, all this in the beautiful kierland commons
17292 Good morning America
17293 Alas...I've given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isn't at least 4 stars.
17294 Sue me; I'm in the industry.
17295 Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently.
17296 I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date.
17297 Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it.
17298 When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden.
17299 Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure.
17300 The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.
17301 We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while.
17302 The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal.
17303 After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge!
17304 What I did eat of it was delicious.
17305 My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes.
17306 Amazing.
17307 Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it.
17308 :)
17309 Dessert?
17310 Try the banana burrito.
17311 Heaven on the tongue!
17312 Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night.
17313 It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that.
17314 If you're in the area...check it out.
17315 If you aren't...check it out.
17316 I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.
17317 Wow!
17318 Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross.
17319 But this past weekend I was blown away.
17320 I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower.
17321 The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves.
17322 After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me.
17323 I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy.
17324 Christopher's truly rose to the occasion.
17325 Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was "on it".
17326 Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed.
17327 She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range.
17328 We had a wonderful time.
17329 We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly.
17330 Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice.
17331 Ben was our go to guy.
17332 He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive.
17333 As for the food, well, it's Chris, come on!
17334 I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection.
17335 All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed.
17336 Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything.
17337 the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride.
17338 Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team.
17339 You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did.
17340 The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering!
17341 Hmmm, can you say "Christmas Party"?
17342 The food on its own is very good, probably worthy of a four star rating by itself, especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley.
17343 I bumped Grazie up from four-stars to five-stars because the service is very, very good, ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.
17344 As for the pizza in particular: for a NY native, finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible.
17345 Good thin-crust (Italian-style, as opposed to NY- or Chicago-style), like what they have at Grazie, does happen to be a bit easier to execute, and Grazie does it well.
17346 Would I have loved to find a great NY- or Chicago-style slice instead?
17347 Sure, but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless.
17348 WOW!
17349 Carmel sundae was amazing!
17350 My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.
17351 We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.
17352 The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.
17353 After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.
17354 We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.
17355 We were flat out denied.
17356 Twice.
17357 We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.
17358 Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.
17359 Seriously?!?!
17360 Just over $100 later we were on our way!
17361 I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.
17362 We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.
17363 How disappointing.
17364 I have have been going to Bosa off and on since they opened.
17365 Have a bad experience and stop for a while.
17366 Then I tell myself " It's right down the street why not " then disappointment again.
17367 1.
17368 Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts, that they ONLY do on Fri. Sure enough nothing was prepared.
17369 Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts.
17370 Noticeable very, very, very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead.
17371 Was planning on a dozen, but had to settle for what they had.
17372 Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under $ 5.00.
17373 When you don't have what you advertise, you might want to waive the .50 fee.
17374 Or you will really piss off that customer.
17375 Common sense.
17376 2.
17377 Customer service is horrible.
17378 See #1.
17379 3.
17380 When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered.
17381 I don't understand it ????
17382 I'm perplexed ???
17383 I don't think it's anything personal.
17384 I just never get the correct dozen.
17385 They close the box, I pay and go home.
17386 Surprise.
17387 The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts.
17388 They are convenient and close, but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts.
17389 Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period!
17390 These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around.
17391 They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop.
17392 It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach.
17393 The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent.
17394 I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs.
17395 Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with.
17396 Thanks Impact AB for everything!
17397 Good service.
17398 Excellent value.
17399 I went for the "All You Can Eat" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours.
17400 I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit.
17401 The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast.
17402 I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices.
17403 This is one of my favorite go-to places in Phoenix, and I feel fortunate to live just a mile away.
17404 The atmosphere is excellent - low-lighting, wooden floors, modern decor in a vintage-looking house-turned-restaurant.
17405 The food is even better.
17406 I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay).
17407 I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.
17408 The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich.
17409 The mac and cheese is superb, as well.
17410 Seriously, everything rocks.
17411 I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence.
17412 Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either.
17413 The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get!
17414 I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.
17415 It used to be an old post office, thus the name.
17416 It is now a wine bar that serves "light fare."
17417 There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.
17418 One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.
17419 Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.
17420 The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.
17421 The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.
17422 Come early, get your table and enjoy!
17423 I'm usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!
17424 It's very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!
17425 Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week it's $11.99.
17426 Well worth every penny.
17427 One more comment, this isn't the kind of buffet where "shifty people" go.
17428 The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )
17429 This review is directly for Joe that works at this specific location.
17430 From the first time I entered the store with my boyfriend, I can't explain how much of a help Joe has been.
17431 Not only is he knowledgeable about every product in the store, his warm character makes it an absolute pleasure to shop there.
17432 If it were up to me.... Joe would be a regional manager!
17433 I am not religious, but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this place--and the neighboring Windsor.
17434 Seriously... a latte, ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other.
17435 Dear Lord, I have reached bliss.
17436 I can die happy now.
17437 Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough.
17438 I prefer to gripe that they aren't open 24/7 because this is my bliss and damn it...
17439 I need it at all hours.
17440 Always friendly.
17441 Always clean.
17442 Always awesome.
17443 Yes, there is heaven.
17444 "One, two Feddys coming for you!"
17445 "Three, four better lock your door!"
17446 "Five, six pick up a crucifix!"
17447 "Seven, eight better stay up late!"
17448 "Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush he'd have had great skin!"
17449 Dude, this place is AMAZING!
17450 All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.
17451 My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.
17452 It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!
17453 his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!
17454 And it's not just the martinis!
17455 I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.
17456 They also have a great men's line as well.
17457 I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.
17458 It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.
17459 Wow!
17460 I have never felt good after a shave!
17461 Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.
17462 Get thee to Lush!
17463 I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location.
17464 I went there looking for a very odd beer.
17465 Not only did they have it, they had tons of it.
17466 The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed.
17467 They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for.
17468 It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff.
17469 I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys.
17470 Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!
17471 I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing.
17472 It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined.
17473 Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges.
17474 I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.
17475 This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste.
17476 Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
17477 I can't wait to go back.
17478 Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation, my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied.
17479 Maui Dog is not exactly the same, nor should it be, but it has the same awesome concept, plus more!
17480 I've been here twice, once had a beef dog, the other a turkey dog.
17481 Both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple.
17482 These suckers are huge!
17483 And messy!
17484 And delicious!
17485 The dog has good flavor, mixed with the slightly sweet bun, spicy mayo and sweet pineapple...perfect!
17486 I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to-go.
17487 The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty, but that absolutely does not deter from the taste.
17488 I can't wait till I have the time to eat-in and try the rest of their tasty-sounding menu!
17489 I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture.
17490 At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.
17491  On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home.
17492 The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down.
17493 When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos).
17494 After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish.
17495 I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me.
17496 There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to "stop harassing the fish."
17497 Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to "harass" any fish.
17498 After this rude treatment I promptly left.
17499 This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).
17500 I won't be doing business here when I move.
17501 Very bad food!
17502 I love this place.
17503 I'm mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well!
17504 The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies!
17505 The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory.
17506 They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot!
17507 I know I will continue to come back for more.
17508 i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner.
17509 i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us.
17510 let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week.
17511 i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting)
17512 my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top.
17513 mine was delicious and i tasted hers.
17514 hers was so good!
17515 i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.
17516 the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta.
17517 while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.
17518 the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch.
17519 i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio.
17520 and the trend continued.
17521 their food is so good!!!!
17522 and its like $8!!
17523 and since i work nearby i get a discount!
17524 today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms.
17525 i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning.
17526 some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.
17527 i love this place!
17528 MEOW!
17529 This place is great - super clean, loaded with an amazing assortment of natural foods for both pooches and kitties, and two fridges jammed full with raw diet selections!
17530 My four-footed kids were in heaven going through the bags!
17531 Not wanting to offend anyone in my bunch (it's impossible to travel anywhere with three dogs and two cats, while simultaneously maintaining any level of decorum), I went solo this weekend to support the latest AzRESCUE effort being sponsored by the store.
17532 In addition to them sending me home with a complimentary Yoghund for each of the kids, I got some great insight to private training that my youngest is in desperate need of if he ever hopes to be socially acceptable, and some great toys for the felines.
17533 The staff was unbelievably nice, they have some truly unique items, and the prices range from "wow that's pretty cheap" to OMG do I dare?!!
17534 !
17535 This is a great option to the chains and big box stores, so grab your leash, wag that tail, and pad your way on down to the Noble Beast!!
17536 !
17537 I really Love this place!
17538 I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things.
17539 The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is:
17540 roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter,
17541 sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one.
17542 The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.
17543 I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!
17544 My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese!
17545 The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!
17546 I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum .
17547 My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive.
17548 The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them.
17549 I hope they get it " that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back".
17550 Lee's is the best privately owned ice cream parlor in Scottsdale!
17551 Located in Old Town Scottsdale in the heart of some prime dining locations, Lee's is a great night cap in the form of ice cream, a superb place to bring a date or all in all just a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy some ice cream con alcohol.
17552 Let's start with the aesthetics; Lee's offers a very clean, small, cozy environment.
17553 A few table and chair sets dot the inside and a couple more to match on the outside.
17554 Lee has some awesome glass vases on the wall that add a modern touch.
17555 She has a few large clocks with different time zones so you know what time it is on the east coast while you eat?
17556 I dunno the clocks were kind of a head scratcher.
17557 The Service is spectacular!
17558 Lee is the only help I've ever received there, so I am not sure if she works alone or has help.
17559 She is always timely and prompt to greet and serve you and automatically starts you off with TWO samples of which ever flavors you would like.
17560 All the young ones like myself be prepared to show ID, although you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get loaded, Lee doesn't skimp on the booze either.
17561 Lee is usually a bit on the quiet side so you gotta listen up and be as patient with her as she is with you.
17562 The lady is running the joint by herself!
17563 The Product is what makes Lee's so good!
17564 Her ice cream flavors are inventive and wonderful.
17565 There is usually new options as well a few solid customer favorites too choose from.
17566 As pre-mentioned Lee does pack a fair amount of liquor in her ice cream so some of the flavors have a stronger alcohol flavor than others.
17567 The Jack Daniel's chocolate swirl is my personal favorite and has the perfect amount of bourbon to chocolate ratio to make a unique, delectable treat.
17568 Lee does offer non-alcoholic flavors (at a discounted price, too!)
17569 for those opt to take there alcohol and ice cream separate.
17570 The cookie dough flavor may be the best ice cream I have tried with or without booze.
17571 Juan Jaime's is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results.
17572 The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more.
17573 The simple menu offers approachable, exciting, delicious food that satisfies any appetite.
17574 The Margarita's flavor should be praised.
17575 And the staff is top notch.
17576 This is just what Chandler needed.
17577 If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi.
17578 You'll thank me later.
17579 I can't wait to go back.
17580 Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa.
17581 I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen.
17582 When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk.
17583 I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old.
17584 My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed.
17585 There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall.
17586 There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation.
17587 If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performance's then I would recommend Coffee Talk.
17588 Horrible!
17589 I had a gel manicure.
17590 The tech didn't let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped, clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy.
17591 The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others.
17592 I didn't realize it until I got home.
17593 I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail.
17594 I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer.
17595 I called and told them about what happened.
17596 The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money.
17597 I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place.
17598 We were excited to check out this new restaurant!
17599 We were left extremely underwhelmed.
17600 We sat in the bar to watch MNF.
17601 It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a "sports bar".
17602 It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.
17603 The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well.
17604 Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails.
17605 You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix.
17606 The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.
17607 We ordered the pumpkin margarita.
17608 I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food.
17609 I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.
17610 Queso dip: cold
17611 Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad
17612 Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites.
17613 I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered.
17614 Fail
17615 Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks.
17616 Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken.
17617 Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry.
17618 My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF.
17619 Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar.
17620 Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them.
17621 Onto the Entrees:
17622 I ordered the carne Asada steak.
17623 My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter.
17624 They were delivered by TQLA manager "Joe".
17625 Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food.
17626 He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly.
17627 Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust.
17628 Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.
17629 He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair.
17630 Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.
17631 At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees.
17632 We dig in:
17633 Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor.
17634 Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?
17635 Where is the heat...?
17636 Bland
17637 I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way.
17638 Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool.
17639 Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.
17640 This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop.
17641 FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own.
17642 You don't have to stand there and hold it up.
17643 Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot.
17644 Amazing!, I crave see on a daily basis!
17645 They are absolutely delicious, it's weird, they are like cupcakes from heaven!
17646 Sure 3.50 is a little pricey, but they truly are the best cupcakes I've ever had.
17647 Everyone there is always so nice and friendly, my only complaint is I wish they had one closer to my house!
17648 Get the red velvet...you won't be sorry.
17649 The lemon, cinnamon sugar, and peanut butter chocolate chip are also very good.
17650 Yum!
17651 !
17652 I cannot say enough about how much I LOVE We Care Family Wellness Center!
17653 I refer everyone I know to them.
17654 Dr. Ross, Cheryl, and everyone on staff are truly wonderful.
17655 They genuinely care about you as a person and always make you feel like you are the only patient on the planet whenever they are with you.
17656 They are never rushed and will take all the time in the world to listen to you and figure out what's going on with you.
17657 After having seen more doctors than I care to remember, I feel so blessed that I have found such amazing healthcare providers!
17658 I have been going to Elite Nails for two years and they have always been wonderful!
17659 People see my nails and always ask where I go.
17660 I highly recommend.
17661 I had such a great experience with Love Carpet Care and Repair.
17662 They were friendly and courteous and enthusiastic every time I spoke to them on the phone, and their work was incredible.
17663 I hired them to clean a carpet in an apartment.
17664 The leasing office at the apt complex told me the carpet was in such bad shape they would have to trash it.
17665 (Quick aside: I did not live in the apartment, but I was responsible for the damage...)  Love Carpet Care did such a good job cleaning the carpet it looked nearly new again.
17666 Truly outstanding.
17667 And, most importantly, the price they quoted me beforehand - when I gave them an honest account of the condition and size - was the final price.
17668 Love it!
17669 And it was cheap.
17670 I was desperate and upset enough that they really could have charged me anything, but they were wonderful.
17671 Honest, hardworking, helpful.
17672 I could never say enough good things about this company.
17673 Let me start off by saying that there are several Slices restaurants in the Valley.
17674 The one on Mill is by far the best.
17675 They have the most amazing and original selection of pizza.
17676 No matter what you pick, it will be good.
17677 If your favorite isn't available when you walk in, no problem!
17678 They will make it for you!
17679 If you are looking for a slice of heaven, you MUST try the salad pizza.
17680 No, its not lettuce on crust!
17681 It is simply the most unbelievable creation that includes artichokes, red pepper, and spinach.
17682 It is great by itself, but ask for them to put balsamic dressing on top.
17683 The balsamic takes it from being amazing to last meal quality :-)
17684 Very authentic, excellent Thai food and soothing ambience.
17685 And they have delivery!
17686 My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Egg Rolls, Clear Noodle Soup, Pad Thai Chicken, Phad-See-Ew Beef, Papaya Salad, etc..
17687 I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard.
17688 It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with.
17689 Delicious sandwiches!!
17690 its so worth the drive i just wish it was closer to home so we could eat there more.
17691 My hubby brought me a sandwich home a couple weeks ago and it wasn't the same, it was too soggy so id prefer to eat there.
17692 The regular ham with added bacon is the best!
17693 !
17694 I just purchased a new Sorento here and my experience was amazing.
17695 Mike Bergesson was super easy to work with and got me a great deal.
17696 I live 50 miles away and there are 4 closer Kia dealerships, but I would do business with Salazar Kia over the others any day.
17697 Thanks!
17698 Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot.
17699 As far as the place, its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes.
17700 I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years.
17701 This is a favorite of my friend's whole family.
17702 This place is so very consistent.
17703 They always have the same good things.
17704 If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place.
17705 Everyone is so very nice.
17706 This place has been open for 30 years for good reason.
17707 I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good.
17708 Go and try not to get hooked.
17709 Enjoy!
17710 i stopped by here on a lunch break because the sign said appraisals by appointment.
17711 the owner (?)
17712 indra was there and willing to do the appraisal on my engagement ring while i waited (without an appointment ...
17713 yay!).
17714 he cleaned my ring at no charge, inspected it and provided the retail value at no charge.
17715 indra told me a written appraisal for insurance purposes is only $45 ... a bargain compared to what others in the valley are charging.
17716 the stock of jewelry was lovely ... a nice mix of new and used pieces.
17717 some very unique, one of a kind finds as well.
17718 i found a few things i would prefer not to live without!
17719 they do all their own importing, and buy, sell and trade jewelry.
17720 i felt he was very honest about my ring, the cash value he stated was in line with numbers i heard from other jewelers and he was charming and helpful, answering questions and educating me while i ogled over diamonds and pearls.
17721 i will return to have my watch batteries replaced, a pair of earrings changed from yellow to white gold, and pretty much anything else i can think of.
17722 i trusted him immediately, which, when dealing with diamonds, is of paramount importance to me.
17723 Heaven.
17724 Fuego is just heaven.
17725 This super small, yet charming place is our favorite!!
17726 The menu is unique, and delish!!
17727 The creamed corn is to die for, I am talking unbelievable!
17728 !
17729 Thirsty?
17730 Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour.
17731 Only negative is, that because of its small size, it fills up fast.
17732 reservations are a must!
17733 whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh$t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay, my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys, shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes
17734 I have been going to Mesha's Salon and Spa for the past 5 years and absolutley love it.
17735 I see Michelle (the owner) and she comes up with some great new looks for me.
17736 I have gone from short hair, funky styles and colors and long and sexy hair.
17737 She is awesome and I love her recommendations.
17738 There have been times I have gone in and not knowing what to do... and she always comes up with something that makes me feel fabulous !
17739 !
17740 I will never go anywhere else.
17741 had a great time here the other day!
17742 the food was delicious and the staff was just as wonderful.
17743 i can't wait to come back here and try out more of their dishes!
17744 I do not understand less than four stars.
17745 We had six different plates.
17746 Beet Salad, Rabit, Butter,Scallops,Strawberry desert, and Peach desert.
17747 All were brilliant.
17748 Our favorite (both agreed) was the Beet Salad.
17749 It was so fresh and had a perfect combo of flavors and textures.
17750 Service was way more than perfect.
17751 One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine.
17752 No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona.
17753 One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu :-)
17754 Good micro brew made right there.
17755 Food is good as well.
17756 So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet.
17757 Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least.
17758 We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside.
17759 We were literally outnumbered by the people working there.
17760 I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS.
17761 I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that.
17762 At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself.
17763 The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was.
17764 The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad.
17765 When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile.
17766 Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return.
17767 If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!
17768 Let me start off by saying that if there were 6 stars, I'd give this place 6 stars!
17769 "Last Chance" is simply amazing, but only to those true bargain shopaholics.
17770 There are days when the store will be flourishing with dreamlike items fluttering all over the place, waiting to be picked up and finding a new home in your closet.
17771 Other times, you must dig deep, and then come out with a diamond in the rut.
17772 I visited "Last Chance" today and fell in love all over again.
17773 I got a BCBG dress, three name brand tees, two casual dresses, eight hair bands, a adorable pair of earrings, FIVE purses and a pair of lace leggings for $39.00.
17774 And they all still had the Nordstrom tag on it!!!
17775 !
17776 They had so many things on sale (in addition to their already low prices).
17777 To truely love "Last Chance", you must have an open mind and realize that this is not your typical department store, therefore it will not operate like one, so get over the kids, crowds and messes, it's Nordstrom stuff at below yardsale prices!!
17778 You must also be fashion and brand savvy.
17779 "Uhh.. Darn diggity goodness mother of Betunia McGrittles, these scary looking boots with a devil pointy edge are $29.99, and they look like they have been tried on oh fooey pooey, that is just too garsh darn expensive Gurtude, And someone wrote their name, "Jimmy Choo" on it.
17780 Uhh, why are there so many  people ALL over the place, and grabbing shoes like crazy making a mess.. Oh goodness heaven no, this store is horrible.. Just like that "Juicy Couture" jumpsuit for $9.99 a piece up front, oh no another child making a mess, let's get out of here and go to Sears or JC Penny, they have such great elastic pants grandma jeans and they never have a mess there!
17781 I do not see why people like this place darn diggity.." -Random "Last Chance" non-enthusiast.
17782 Key point, if you're not into brands and fashion, and are not creative and a bargain shopper lover, then you will not appreciate this beautiful place we are so lucky to have in Phoenix!!
17783 :)
17784 "Last Chance" tips..
17785 (All "Last Chancers" will put a  hit on me after this, but I love my fellow yelpers oh so much lol)
17786 *Arrive EARLY.
17787 Anytime after noon all the goods will most likey be gone and all the damaged/ugly stuff will be left.
17788 *WATCH YOUR CART!
17789 People will take you 25.00 pair of Coach wedges lol
17790 *Don't make eye contact with anyone!
17791 Don't trust anyone!
17792 If you see a pair of Seven jeans for 14.99 DESCRETELY grab them and move on.. Any sense of alert will beckon a herd of jean hungry woman and you will get mobbed!
17793 *Move QUICKLY, if you have to RUN!
17794 Especially if you are there right when they open, set your mind to what you want and RUN to that department.
17795 This will assure first dibs on the that section's finest.
17796 *Don't start crap with ANYONE!
17797 It can get really ugly.. and there is a wall of pictures of "banned" people from "Last Chance" and that is no where you want to end up in for ANYONE!
17798 The rest of the tips are too super insider to say aloud, sorry huns!
17799 but I will spill one super "Last Chancer" tip..Happy shopping!
17800 muaaah :)
17801 *Look in the size 10-11 in woman shoes, that's where all the BEST shoes are "hidden"  or "stashed" by other people who will be back later that day or had to go to the bathroom upstairs and didn't have anyone to hold their shoes.
17802 No woman really wears those sizes so they figure to just stash them there for a few minutes..
17803 I cannot begin to describe the designer glories I have discovered stuffed behind a size 11 pair of Pumas..
17804 NOTE TO EVERYONE: OVERALL, PLEASE BE NICE AND SHARE.
17805 THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO THERE JUST TO FIND DEALS AND RESELL THEM ON EBAY AND THEY CAN BE JUST PLAIN MEAN.
17806 REMEMBER, WE ARE ALL HUMAN AND MUST BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER, NO CURSING, SHOVING, ECT.
17807 LET'S MAKE LAST CHANCE A NICE PLACE TO SHOP, AND END THE VIOLENCE AND ANGER OVER CLOTHES/PURSES/SHOES ECT.
17808 WE CANNOT SELL OUR SOULS TO THEM.
17809 TAKE CARE EVERYONE :)
17810 Great food can be found anywhere.
17811 Great service is one in a million these days.
17812 This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going.
17813 You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.
17814 It's simple.
17815 Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers.
17816 Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received.
17817 I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib.
17818 We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears.
17819 We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time.
17820 Wrong thing to do.
17821 I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant.
17822 It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out.
17823 All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan).
17824 Not once did our server come by our table.
17825 We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables.
17826 It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing.
17827 We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her.
17828 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should.
17829 Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored.
17830 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared.
17831 Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check.
17832 He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.
17833 We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap.
17834 We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying.
17835 The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point.
17836 To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review.
17837 I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food.
17838 I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.
17839 Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon.
17840 Who knows.
17841 All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.
17842 I've been really impressed with John Skiba and his professionalism.
17843 He is always up to date on everything in bankruptcy law and I've enjoyed reading his blog posts.
17844 It really shows his expertise and passion for what he does.
17845 Hopefully I will never need his services but if I ever were to need an Arizona bankruptcy attorney I would go to him first for sure.
17846 My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.
17847 We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.
17848 There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.
17849 It's in a strip mall and looks old.
17850 At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.
17851 When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.
17852 We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.
17853 To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.
17854 I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.
17855 It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the "look how good I was" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.
17856 We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.
17857 He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.
17858 There is no drink menu on the menu.
17859 No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.
17860 We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.
17861 Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.
17862 The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.
17863 While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.
17864 Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.
17865 More lack of information from the menu.
17866 Now on to the decor.
17867 It is terribly outdated.
17868 Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.
17869 There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.
17870 I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.
17871 I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.
17872 I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.
17873 This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.
17874 The lasagna came.
17875 It was OK at best.
17876 I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.
17877 The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.
17878 We did not take our leftovers.
17879 We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious.
17880 We won't be back.
17881 To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far.
17882 Total bait and switch sales department!
17883 Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive!
17884 Happened to me personally 3 times.
17885 I bought from Scottsdale BMW.
17886 One quote, one price, done deal.
17887 Buyer beware...
17888 I dined here last week with my wife and in-laws and, I gotta say, it doesn't get much better.
17889 Ambiance was dark but classy.
17890 Loved the music (no dated Rat Pack stuff here).
17891 Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries.
17892 The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce I've ever had in my life!
17893 Only got better from there: Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean!
17894 For entrees, my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two.
17895 One of the top meals I've ever had in my life.
17896 The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac & cheese and onion jus.
17897 I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share.
17898 My wife couldn't stop talking about the Kobe Trio.
17899 But, I gotta say, the best part of the experience was the staff.
17900 Knowledgeable just isn't enough to describe the service here.
17901 They care about every single detail, never missing one.
17902 The Sommelier made excellent wine recommendations (and each one well within my price range) and never skipped a beat when it came to pouring for the table.
17903 The server was as professional as professional gets and the Manager seemed to always be there to pull out a chair or provide a fresh napkin.
17904 Flawless.
17905 Well done Bourbon Steak!
17906 Love love love this place!
17907 Seriously, a place in Phoenix that is locally owned, has great prices, great food and buys local is pretty hard to find.
17908 My favorite wrap is the Gardin'n salad as a wrap.
17909 My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking!
17910 But still well worth it.
17911 I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc.
17912 Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.
17913 First off a little background, Christopher is a native.
17914 That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School.
17915 He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from.
17916 He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar.
17917 Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood.
17918 It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe.
17919 There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French.
17920 Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead.
17921 Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu.
17922 So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about.
17923 The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food.
17924 I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING.
17925 I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's!
17926 Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful.
17927 Christopher's is the latter.
17928 The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams.
17929 Kudos to whoever designed it, great job!
17930 The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware.
17931 You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated.
17932 The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.
17933 The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices.
17934 He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added!
17935 I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally.
17936 Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday.
17937 But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.
17938 Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart.
17939 It doesn't get any better than this.
17940 Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).
17941 The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).
17942 Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets.
17943 The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.
17944 Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion?
17945 Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the "chef's chef".
17946 But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!
17947 Here's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/
17948 The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...
17949 Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale....
17950 Just don't.
17951 My wife and I ate here last night and were extremly happy.
17952 We started with drinks at the bar, which started the night out perfectlly, then we had an appetizaer, which was a tower of cheese ( a sculpture of grilled cheese, like the hard grilled cheese on the sides of a grilled cheese sandwich).
17953 I had the tacos, they may be small, but they were packed by taste.
17954 My wife had the fish of the day, and that day it was halibut, my wife said it was the best fish she ever had.
17955 The service was great, overall a great smalll place to eat.
17956 Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out.
17957 I believe they have several stores now here in the valley.
17958 The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on...
17959 I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.
17960 The scenery was amazing!!
17961 Wooooooooo!!
17962 - Well thats my biggest impression of this place.
17963 If you're looking for a great place to golf, i suggest you swing by this place.
17964 They give you 5 stars customer service and making sure that you're having the best time of your life.
17965 AAAAMAZING.
17966 They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had.
17967 It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs.
17968 They have good fries, excellent onion rings.... and very very reasonable prices!
17969 I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Ted's..... definitely a must try!
17970 WOW!
17971 From service to food, 5 stars!
17972 Went here last night for our 10th anniversary.
17973 They never cease to amaze us.
17974 Husband had a Caesar salad, Rib Eye with crab legs and I had a salad with Balsamic Vinagrette,  Salmon with Asian glaze with a carrott and swiss chard medley.
17975 Amazing!!
17976 Perfection.
17977 Kyle served us, we were impressed by his knowledge of the menu and attention to detail.
17978 Everyone we came in contact with was pleasant.
17979 If only more restaurants treated their patrons this way!
17980 If you have their VIP card you also earn 'points' which convert into $ you can use towards a future visit.
17981 Thanks Kyle and McCormick and Schmicks!
17982 !
17983 Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco!
17984 But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours.
17985 Granted there may still be a wait here but you aren't fighting tourist for tables at this joint.
17986 It's more of a local fav!
17987 Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust!
17988 Personally a big fan of the garden seating!
17989 There was a longer than normal wait for the food however, the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden.
17990 I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation!
17991 Try the Larb, it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option.
17992 This one dish alone ($5) at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great.
17993 I don't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat, and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet, IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue, it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume, truly unique.
17994 Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.
17995 Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies.
17996 When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with.
17997 We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great!
17998 Um.
17999 YAY!
18000 Picture a girl hanging with her lovely on a Monday afternoon after what could be politely described as a terrible week before, looking to soothe her spirit with some lovely food and atmosphere [the company was already delightful...].
18001 I saw a piece in the local rag about C4 and since we're already in Moon Valley I say 'how 'bout it'.
18002 Jeff agrees and we're off -
18003 We arrived just before 4 - closing time and the bartender/waitperson was reeeeally nice.
18004 She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off.
18005 No worries, we remain unfazed.
18006 We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace.
18007 The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in.
18008 We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich.
18009 I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef.
18010 The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers, cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo [not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same] on a toasted baguette.
18011 Roast beef was similar in scale, lots of meat with melted cheddar, greens also on a toasted baguette.
18012 Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle.
18013 It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon, we didn't feel rushed or in the way.
18014 It was just a nice, shoulder dropping, ahhhh experience.
18015 Not the spa, but just what the doctor ordered.
18016 Serious yay, total digdom.
18017 We wanted to plant a place just like it of our own on the beach in Maui...its nice to dream...Totally worth the trip; we will be back
18018 Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited.
18019 Thank God I live almost across the street!
18020 After many, many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen, I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should.
18021 But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are.
18022 Try it, you'll like it!
18023 What ever you do don't waste your money here.
18024 I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.
18025 I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.
18026 The food has such a horrible after taste.
18027 I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.
18028 The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.
18029 I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies.
18030 I woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito.
18031 Fortunately just 3 days ago, a menu was left on our door for Cisco's Grill (with some great marketing I might add).
18032 Conveniently located right up the street from my house, I've been curious about this place since they opened!
18033 I strapped on my shoes and walked on over... upon entering I was greeted cordially and placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito with cheese...
18034 The cook went to work and 5 minutes later I was holding a fresh hot burrito and a complimentary pineapple water!
18035 Cisco came out and introduced himself while I was waiting and chatted with me for a few minutes.
18036 Its clear to me that he's very passionate about his restaurant!
18037 The service is top notch!
18038 The menu itself is fairly generic, typical burger and fries, tacos and burritos, but everything is so fresh and prepared well!
18039 I'd recommend this joint to anyone looking for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat!
18040 I walked in and uttered, "I think I found my new home".
18041 1) Miller High Life on draught and bottle.
18042 2) Buckhunt (the lil orange gun has even been taped together-double buck bonus!)
18043 3) Bowling videogame...god, I love these things
18044 4) Indoor smoking lounge!!!
18045 With a large screen TV, two tables and a lot of pleather seating, the large fan won't mean much but WOW-exciting!
18046 There is a french style door separating the lounge from the bar area where the stage is so you can still peak at the band while sucking tar.
18047 5) Well...even the womens' bathroom is pretty gnarly...which would normally subtract a star-but I was so happy to pee in the unmarked restroom I won't touch it!
18048 Other notes: all bartender, barbacks, security were extremely sweet and friendly; all other patrons were either pretty chill, excited to see the band that was playing or willing to strike up conversation; tons of televisions everywhere; they had a lot of beers on tap-cheap too; this place is HUGE.
18049 In fact I would consider it a liability since there are a lot of steps connecting each section-at times I found myself balancing precariously-and that is b/c I am a klutz-wasn't even drunk...ok, not that drunk.
18050 Most everyone had tats, black hair, laid back.
18051 This is def.
18052 not a scene-and I love that!
18053 I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good.
18054 Delicious Scallops and pasta.
18055 Also the pizza was excellent.
18056 The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again.
18057 OK: call me 'weird' here: but; I liked the funky (very) Old School ambiance of MacAlpines when my fiance and I went there this past Sunday for the Studebaker and friends car show.
18058 Admittedly; I was there once before ca.
18059 1999 and was NOT impressed but things have def improved IMHO.
18060 I had a Club sandwich and it was one of the best ones I've ever had, at least in recent years.
18061 Would eat one again.
18062 The chocolate milk shake was OK but could have used a tad more syrup but, I'd have one again.
18063 My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.
18064 The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!
18065 We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!
18066 One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.
18067 I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.
18068 Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.
18069 The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class.
18070 What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.
18071 Authentic...absolutely authentic.
18072 Joe's has long been one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert.
18073 The pulled pork is excellent, the sides are even better, and the service is always friendly.
18074 Don't be intimidated by a long line, even out the door, as it moves fast.
18075 The cheesy potatoes and corn are great.
18076 The lemon cake is very moist and a nice finish to a meal.
18077 Be sure to stop by on your birthday and pick up a free meal.
18078 The kids love running around outside in the grassy area, and always enjoy going to Joe's.
18079 I'm sorry to say that they closed their doors for good just a few weeks ago!
18080 I hardly ever give five star reviews.
18081 My experience at Culinary Dropout today prompted me to do so.
18082 The reason we checked this place out was because I had a 25% coupon from Fox RC for Labor Day.
18083 First things first: The employees are extremely good looking.
18084 There is lots of tattoos and bare skin.
18085 Our bartender was awesome.
18086 He answered all our dumb questions with a smile and made some killer drinks.
18087 I had the Bacon Infused Bloody Mary and my friend had the Acai Mojito.
18088 I will be going back again to have that Bloody Mary.
18089 It was SO good.
18090 We started out with the homemade chips and onion dip and it was delicious.
18091 We pretty much filled up on those before we got our meals.
18092 I ordered the Havarti Burger, my roommate got the chef salad, and my other friend got the canneloni.
18093 Everything was super good, but it was too much food!
18094 My burger melted in my mouth and I kept stealing bites of my friend's salad.
18095 So, in a nutshell:
18096 - Great vibe.
18097 - Great food.
18098 - Great drinks.
18099 - Hot employees.
18100 - Clever menu titles/
18101 - Great experience!
18102 I love this place: look for the specials and the different events they always have going on.
18103 It's a great spot in the Valley.
18104 Always great, fast and consistent!
18105 The service is excellent, the staff has worked there for years and is speedy to run around and refill drinks and clear dishes.
18106 It's nice to have the counter service so you don't have to wait to be waited on...because if I am at the mall I am there for serious business:)  If you like a home grown grilled cheese and some tomato soup or a salmon Cesar salad or even a gourmet pizza this is the place.
18107 The brownie and the red velvet cake are hard to resist ...get both!
18108 I have long liked Tempe Maretplace since it has opened.
18109 It is a good location, lots of parking all around.
18110 Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors.
18111 There is a major selection or stores ,restaurants and services here.
18112 My girlfriend likes it as well.
18113 So it is a win win set up.
18114 They are decorated really well and they have a multitude of events here.
18115 Even a Barnes and Noble,which bookstores are not that easy to come accross now days.
18116 yummy..  you will love this place.
18117 I love to sit on the patio on a nice day and enjoy!
18118 the sangria is amazing..  and lettuce wraps soooo great!!
18119 give it a try!
18120 After bad experience, I will never return.
18121 It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.
18122 The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.
18123 I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.
18124 The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.
18125 If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.
18126 Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.
18127 It is night and day.
18128 Bike cabs beware!
18129 You've got nothing on this rig!
18130 Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event.
18131 As "pedalers" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!
18132 We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system.
18133 Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show.
18134 If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait.
18135 As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes.
18136 If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted "non pedaling" seats in the back of the bike.
18137 We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system.
18138 Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining.
18139 They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have "that guy" in our group.
18140 If you're saying to yourself,  "Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg" then you would be wrong!
18141 With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.
18142 But wait, there's more!
18143 Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route.
18144 On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!
18145 I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!
18146 So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%!
18147 "Look Ma!
18148 No hands!"
18149 Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend.
18150 First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over.
18151 I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER.
18152 Walked up to buy my ticket, and the lady was a total jerk!
18153 She had no idea when the movie times were, and she clearly thought we were stupid.
18154 She messed up our change, and didn't believe us when we told her.
18155 When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands.
18156 When it came time to order our food, the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup.
18157 The theater was extremely dirty, and kids were screaming throughout the movie.
18158 After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience.
18159 He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out.
18160 I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review.
18161 It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away.
18162 Costco Travel - My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island, HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel.
18163 After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair, condo and car.
18164 They didn't have arrangements with any B&Bs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates.
18165 Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate.
18166 Condo was outstanding and a great value.
18167 We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved $$.
18168 I've shopped at Costco for years - now becoming a groupie!
18169 I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO.
18170 We were the only two riders, may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools.
18171 The horses looked very well taken care of.
18172 Mine was 17 year old Sundance, a beautiful brown male.
18173 I've never ridden before, and he was easy to control.
18174 Our guide Ed was patient, funny and awesome company.
18175 He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two.
18176 Tip for the guys, if you plan to trot, wear tight jeans, you will be thankful at the end of the day.
18177 The city slicker that I am,
18178 I left my phone in my shirt pocket, ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it.
18179 The desert, sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening.
18180 I highly recommend CCO.
18181 SIMPLY AMAZING!
18182 WE LOVE IT!
18183 My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD.
18184 They were next door, and we thought lets try something new.
18185 We have been there 3 times since.
18186 You sit, and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar.
18187 ITS GREAT!
18188 Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it.
18189 We ate like King and Queen for $20.00.
18190 They have simple pricing, and it is affordable for a date or family.
18191 I'd have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.
18192 I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.
18193 I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.
18194 I'm a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!
18195 !
18196 I have been going to Tish's studio for years now!
18197 When it comes to choosing a studio to practice at, the environment and the instructors are crucially important.
18198 Hegel Yoga provides an incredible atmosphere to practice yoga, and the variety of classes available leaves little to be desired!
18199 Great energy, great instructors, great studio.
18200 DUDE..where is the manga....where are the card tables.
18201 .....What the heck is this place doing selling comics!
18202 This is outrageous!
18203 And why are you talking to me and trying to help me comic clerk!
18204 Your job is to give me a huge sigh and exasperated look as if I asked you to perform surgery.
18205 This being helpful and friendly is really bothering me.
18206 You guys are just too weird.
18207 I need to go back to Atomic.
18208 Best happy hour in north Scottsdale!
18209 Get there early to beat the crowd.
18210 Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.
18211 Love this lake.
18212 Went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time.
18213 Lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom.
18214 Highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing :)
18215 This gym is great...
18216 I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.
18217 I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.
18218 It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.
18219 The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.
18220 The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.
18221 I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!
18222 All I have to say is get the California Club.
18223 I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich.
18224 I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu.
18225 The drive-thru concept is pretty neat, but there was a bit of a wait.
18226 Guess you can't rush perfection.
18227 This is the BEST hit or miss bargain spot for everything.
18228 I frequently find great deals on quality body care products (be sure you know how to read the labels, there's a lot of low quality products in the mix), designer sun glasses, shoes, clothing, housewares, baby shower gifts, pet gifts, and guy gifts.
18229 It seems I go at peak hours, where lines are incredibly long.
18230 I see it as a small price for Macy's quality at a Walmart price.
18231 A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the "main" menu.
18232 Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.
18233 $7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi.
18234 Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven.
18235 The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.
18236 Beers for as afforadable as $3.25.
18237 Sodas with free refills for $1.95.
18238 Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale?
18239 I didn't think so!
18240 Ted's rules.
18241 Great char-grilled hot dogs, killer onion rings, and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dog-eatin' experience.
18242 I'll be charitable - this place sucks!
18243 I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.
18244 After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department.
18245 The people working there were cold.
18246 uncaring.
18247 not helpful.
18248 no concept of customer service.
18249 I left in disgust!
18250 Couple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.
18251 Voila!
18252 I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.
18253 the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.
18254 Felt like I was among long-time friends!
18255 They even delivered when they said they would.
18256 And, no need to drive half way to tucson and back!
18257 Ikea?
18258 Don't be foolish.
18259 Cost Plus?
18260 Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!
18261 Love this place!
18262 Amazing Happy Hour Specials!
18263 !
18264 Perfect place for a hot summer day.
18265 Amazing paletas!
18266 Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.
18267 Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.
18268 This is by far my favourite department store, hands down.
18269 I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store, without exception, no matter what department I'm in.
18270 The shoe SA's will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe, and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand-written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase - big or small.
18271 Tim & Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words!
18272 I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store.
18273 Frankly, I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people.
18274 One of the things I love the most about Barney's is not only the prompt attention of SA's, but the fact that they aren't rushing around trying to help 35 people at once.
18275 The SA's at Barney's are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation, regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not.
18276 I have also never experienced a "high pressure" sale situation here.
18277 All in all, Barneys is pricey, and there is no getting around it.
18278 But, um, so is Neiman's and that place is a crock.
18279 Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you aren't carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars.
18280 Yay Barneys!
18281 Guacamole was best I've had!
18282 Love Bakers.
18283 I live in Glendale an it is worth the drive to go see them.
18284 They know their stuff and am always pleased with my purchases.
18285 Excellent.
18286 Terrific food and service.
18287 Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free children's meals and half price drinks.
18288 The french onion burger is delicious!
18289 Some of the best pizza I've ever had.
18290 The sauce is amazing.
18291 Every time I'm in town I get the sausage and pepperoni with extra sauce.
18292 There's nothing else to say, really.
18293 Go here for good pizza.
18294 Great Pizza.
18295 Great Service.
18296 We've been here a few times since it opened.
18297 And always look forward to going.
18298 We have never had a bad experience.
18299 Each time has been great.
18300 Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball.
18301 I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.
18302 I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!
18303 It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.
18304 Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!
18305 ), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.
18306 I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.
18307 They weren't even that busy!
18308 Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.
18309 I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.
18310 What kind of service is that!?
18311 I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.
18312 Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.
18313 I will NOT be going back, there's no point!
18314 Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!
18315 DECEMBER 2012:They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER!!!!
18316 !
18317 Best whopper EVER.
18318 Mine goes no lettuce, heavy onion, heavy tomato, and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun.
18319 It's THICK.
18320 55 year anniversary --- second whopper 55 cents!
18321 DEAL!!
18322 !
18323 Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper?
18324 :)
18325 this was our first breakfast hit-up since we moved back, and gotta say it again....the protein pancakes are still da bomb.
18326 so lucious, cruchy yet soft, sweet yet salty, healthy but so much syrup...mmmm!
18327 go at an off time or you'll be knocking elbows with the elderly.
18328 AWESOME!!
18329 !
18330 I love this place!
18331 I am from Seattle and I've been struggling to find a good pho restaurant since moving out here.
18332 Khai Hoan reminds me of some of the restaurants I used to go to back home.
18333 I love hole-in-the-wall family restaurants like this one.
18334 No fuss, no frills.
18335 Just good food and fast service.We were greeted, seated, ordered and got our appetizer in 10 minutes.
18336 Food was delicious!!!
18337 Definitely go here!
18338 I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic!
18339 She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience.
18340 Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area.
18341 Yum, yum, yum.
18342 I have put this in my regular rotation for every time I'm in Gilbert.
18343 They have great sandwiches, sides, and burgers and for the most part we have had some fantastic service (my friend has had one or two iffy experiences but mine have all been great)... this past weekend I had one of their burgers of the week which had some white wine grilled onions with Gruyere cheese and it was KILLER, probably my fave burger I've had there.
18344 I've also tried their soups which have been great and their grilled cheese.
18345 The Caprese Pasta Salad is so refreshing and a fave side of mine!
18346 Filthy place.
18347 Bad tasteless food.
18348 Rude waitress.
18349 Yuck!!!
18350 !
18351 I love this place!
18352 We weren't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.
18353 Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky!
18354 We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.
18355 Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options.
18356 I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.
18357 He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.
18358 The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.
18359 They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).
18360 It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from.
18361 We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.
18362 We pack everything up and go back to get those.
18363 The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.
18364 We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.
18365 We decide to let it go and eat our food.
18366 The pulled pork has great flavor.
18367 The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.
18368 However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.
18369 The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.
18370 The ribs were our favorite part!
18371 We absolutely loved them.
18372 Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious.
18373 This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more.
18374 I love the fish tacos from Rubios, I always order them.
18375 Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here.
18376 Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia
18377 i always forget about this place when we do a party.
18378 they carry costumes and party gear year round...even halloween stuff.
18379 stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks, we bought on-line for 30 bucks.
18380 i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween.
18381 but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party, bike pub ride, or just feel like dressing up, this place is perfect!
18382 If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great.
18383 Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint.
18384 The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat.
18385 Don't judge a book by it's cover.
18386 The outside doesn't look so great, but you go inside and it's gorgeous.
18387 The food is some of the best food I've ever eaten.
18388 Their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic!!
18389 The pad thai, chiang mai noodles, pad kra po, pad lard na, etc.
18390 This place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs.
18391 And don't get me started on their fried honey banana dessert.
18392 The best dessert I've ever had!
18393 Check this place out you will not be disappointed.
18394 I WISH I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE.
18395 I stopped by Yogurtland because I went to Spring Training, and I wish I could have stayed forever.
18396 The quality of the frozen yogurt is impeccable.
18397 So many flavors!
18398 I mixed Raspberry Cheesecake with Vanilla Bean, also tried the PB&J flavor (um, YES!?
18399 ), Tangerine Tango, and my usual go-to, Tart.
18400 Very extensive toppings bar.
18401 Good price as well, I just love froyo.
18402 Next time I'm in Scottsdale, this will be one of the first places I go to!
18403 Poor service-small portions-pricey
18404 Excellent neighborhood spot with outstanding food, large portions and reasonable price.
18405 The staff make you feel special and I have not made a bad menu choice.
18406 Try the wings with sauce on the side or the Monday night fried chicken.
18407 Lunch or dinner, Wallys receives 5 stars from me.
18408 Those of us "foodies" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.
18409 I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].
18410 We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].
18411 The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].
18412 The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].
18413 And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!)
18414 was incredible [STAR 5].
18415 'nough said.
18416 I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience.
18417 It's way different than the others and it doesn't "feel" like the other Macayo's.
18418 This one is much more festive.
18419 It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade.
18420 The antique train outside makes it much more interesting.
18421 The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey.
18422 They sacrificed parking for patio seating.
18423 The prices are extremely affordable.
18424 Their food is very good.
18425 Service is always consistent.
18426 Cheap margaritas.
18427 I've never been here on a weekend.
18428 I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch.
18429 This ice has the abilty to make you feel COLD on a 100+ degree day - I am hooked on the Key Lime, Alex's Lemonade, and Florida Orange.
18430 Very nice staff, friendly and free samples ....
18431 This is the new mecca of Phoenix music.
18432 Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all!
18433 He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman.
18434 The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt).
18435 The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!
18436 Thank you Charlie!
18437 Music fans unite!
18438 This place MUST thrive!
18439 btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment).
18440 LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!
18441 Best Mexican food we have had in Arizona yet.
18442 We are partial as we just bought in Fountain Hills and its close, but its also small and although lively, never crowded or noisy.
18443 The service is friendly and fast and the Mexican style music is great but not too loud.
18444 You can easily talk and relax.
18445 Loved the guacomole dip and shrimp cocktail and the fried ice cream is fab and big enough for four people!!
18446 !
18447 I think that most of the negative reviews I've read about this Gold's gym really stem from people's own insecurities.
18448 I have been going here almost 2 months now and have never had a single issue with the gym or ANY of its staff or members!
18449 I find the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, and I was even offered a free personal training session when I signed up to help me get on the right track to meeting my fitness goals!
18450 I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off... who does that??
18451 Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED?
18452 Don't blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff...
18453 Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room.
18454 REALLY?
18455 As a straight male, I can say that I've never felt uncomfortable, and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room.
18456 Get over yourself and your homophobia dude.
18457 Some yelpers truly disgust me....
18458 Great location in a beautiful new area, convenient hours, tons of parking, a BEAUTIFUL state of the art facility.... what is there to complain about??
18459 Show up, work out hard, and go home feeling better about yourself... that's what gyms are for!
18460 !
18461 This place is a dump.
18462 I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did.
18463 It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.
18464 I would skip it.
18465 Still flying solo.
18466 My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.
18467 Humus appetizer was great.
18468 For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.
18469 Recommend!
18470 one of my favorite places !
18471 the place has great atmosphere and character.
18472 the bar is a great place to unwind with friends (or meet new ones) or have dinner.
18473 Michael or Jan will take great care of you at the bar!
18474 The full menu is offered here.
18475 the dining area is warm, elegant, & comfortable, but you are fine to wear your favorite blue jeans.....it is cave creek.
18476 you know!
18477 i have never ordered anything from the menu that did not impress.
18478 regardless of where i dine, if there is a rib eye on the menu, i have to try it.
18479 Cartwrights rib eye (cooked over mesquite) is consistently  my favorite!!
18480 !
18481 from the fish dept, the sea bass is succulent!
18482 my second favorite is the scallops.
18483 they too are cooked over wood and have great flavor/texture and are seared perfectly.
18484 you have to save room for desert......the apple fritters pair well with their local fresh roasted coffee.
18485 you can not go wrong at Cartwrights!
18486 I love this mall.
18487 You need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside!
18488 It is one of the only indoor malls that I like.
18489 I feel so calm when I am here.
18490 You can find just about anything in this mall.
18491 The food court is pretty good.
18492 I like Paradise Cafe for sandwiches.
18493 There are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well.
18494 Plenty of parking or you can just valet.
18495 My favorite Nordstroms is here.
18496 I find the Nordies in SF to be too big and overwhelming.
18497 The one at the Fashion Square is minimalist, well organized, and edited to suit my tastes.
18498 great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant.
18499 you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable.
18500 local breeze made it tolerable and i don't think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience.
18501 they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture.
18502 we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for.
18503 the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees.
18504 their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing.
18505 ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich.
18506 my girlfirned (Rachel O.)
18507 went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish.
18508 it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it.
18509 the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it.
18510 leftovers are always good.
18511 service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before.
18512 get over it, it's no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze.
18513 My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience.
18514 These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely.
18515 This is the second and last time we will frequent this location.
18516 The pizza and calzones were awful.
18517 I took a friend from Europe here this past week.
18518 I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented.
18519 By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere.
18520 The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette.
18521 The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite.
18522 The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection.
18523 This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruth's Chris.
18524 I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty.
18525 My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: It's too bad that so much of the world hates Americans.
18526 They think that Americans are so loud and bossy.
18527 They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want.
18528 In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other.
18529 In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been.
18530 Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friend's visit.
18531 I had heard many great things about Penzey's, but it wasn't until recently that I actually went to the store.
18532 After shopping around and smelling various spices, I wanted to buy everything in the store!
18533 Great for gifts as well!
18534 Love it!
18535 The food is VERY spicy though.
18536 Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)
18537 Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.
18538 I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.
18539 Evidently he loves the food.
18540 It was a very lovely place.
18541 I had read the reviews before arriving and had read that the place looked dated, but it looked very nice to me.
18542 I've been to several hilton family hotels since my hubby is a diamond member and this is one of the better places we've been to.
18543 The only thing that was sorta a deal breaker was that it wasn't near downtown.
18544 One of my fave restaurants!
18545 The unlimited salad is a winner.
18546 It's delicious!
18547 They also have a gluten-free selection that my brother loves!
18548 For Christmas, they also have some gift card deals.
18549 Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices.
18550 In my top 3 quick restaurants.
18551 What a great property.
18552 Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend.
18553 I was over the moon after this stay.
18554 I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend.
18555 Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble.
18556 For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho.
18557 Very fast, friendly check in.
18558 No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter.
18559 Never get that in Vegas...
18560 Decor is startlingly unique.
18561 In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace.
18562 The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate.
18563 It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years.
18564 Studio Suite is super cool.
18565 Clean, good sized and hip.
18566 Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful.
18567 Good bed, good linens, great shower.
18568 Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning.
18569 Good colors, too.
18570 Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs.
18571 Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available.
18572 Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains.
18573 Flat roofs always leak, though.
18574 In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds.
18575 Location is unbeatable.
18576 A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc.
18577 But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night.
18578 Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise.
18579 Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it.
18580 I will absolutely be back.
18581 Makes a great in town escape.
18582 Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!
18583 If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susie's Chile Verde con Carne.
18584 I dream about it.
18585 And I grew up in New Mexico!
18586 The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.
18587 #13...don't forget the sour cream.
18588 So you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!
18589 I've never tried anything else there.
18590 Why would you when you've found green chili heaven?
18591 Man, just talking about it makes me drool.
18592 I'm headed out the door.....Susie's here I come!
18593 All I have to say is wow.
18594 The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind.
18595 I felt pretty confident after seeing some of the photos he had done, but my expectations were far exceeded.
18596 He has a creative eye that caught much more than just the personality of the car.
18597 The picture brought tons of people to my sites asking who shot the pics.
18598 The portraits were truly great and fun to do.
18599 I actually saw myself in a new light that I never saw before.
18600 I loved it.
18601 Anyone can take a picture, but very few people can take pictures that draw people in and seem to almost have an active emotion behind them.
18602 I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need.
18603 Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in Phoenix.
18604 I get the classic, which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese.
18605 It's the only thing I've ever ordered there, because it's so damn good I can't pass it up.
18606 AND they get their beef from humanely raised, grass-fed cows.
18607 And beer selection, and the fries with aioli... Well, others here have told you how good they are.
18608 Pro tip?
18609 Throw a little of that aioli on your burger, too.
18610 Oh, and come hungry--it's a generously sized burger.
18611 It's a little pricey, but Delux is a really delicious treat.
18612 Amazing.
18613 Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas.
18614 Very good.
18615 Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town.
18616 Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!
18617 this is perhaps the best italian food in Az.
18618 We have been going there for about 10 yrs and always recommend this place to all our clients.
18619 Best food, which is all homemade best service.
18620 This place never disappoints us.
18621 We recommend this place to our  clients and the feedback is thank you for the best food experience we have had.
18622 I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.
18623 It was introduced to me by a close friend.
18624 I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online.
18625 I don't mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.
18626 Their consistency has never failed.
18627 This place is great!
18628 lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross.
18629 Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny.
18630 So what if the pants there cost $160?
18631 They are awesome.
18632 Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile?
18633 No.
18634 Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it.
18635 The men's side of the store doesn't carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts.
18636 Everything is so comfortable and if you're overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you don't look like a muffin when you put them on.
18637 I also like the workers there too.
18638 They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the women's shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it.
18639 But I love teal I cried!
18640 If you haven't been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals.
18641 OMG I love this place!!!
18642 Im from Canada and this is "continentally" good
18643 Why everyone in the valley doesn't use this service is beyond me.
18644 They carry every quality pet food manufactured, their prices are competitive, they deliver...FREE... no matter how small the order...right to your door....what a deal.
18645  I've used Goober for a couple of years they have never missed a delivery, never been late.
18646 Great customer service, and the ladies that answer the phone really know their stuff!
18647 Have a pet with allergies...
18648 This is your place for quality pet food, they will aldo have lots a good suggestions on your pets diet.
18649 Blue 32 wins my MVP award.
18650 I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it!
18651 Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale.
18652 The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.
18653 Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1.
18654 Food - This is the best bar food ever!
18655 You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious.
18656 Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well.
18657 2.
18658 TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs.
18659 Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant.
18660 No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.
18661 Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed.
18662 I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games.
18663 Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!
18664 P.S.
18665 GO GIANTS!
18666 =)
18667 Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side.
18668 Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!
18669 Sooooo good!
18670 It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly.
18671 A gem!!
18672 !
18673 Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care.
18674 That is why they offer a "wellness plan".
18675 When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere.
18676 It should not be called a Hopital.
18677 The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet.
18678 The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them.
18679 This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health.
18680 Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food.
18681 To make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!
18682 I am from Chicago - and the italian beef here really is perfection.
18683 Add to that the friendliest people ever and the amazing hotziki with fries- and they've got me forever.
18684 Their falafel wrap is insanely good and the patty melt is to die for.
18685 I could eat here every day - and I practically do!
18686 Super friendly.
18687 Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers.
18688 Great diner food and decor.
18689 Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.
18690 Will definitely be back.
18691 marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.
18692 we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???
18693 felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.
18694 avoid this one, just not worth it.
18695 My favorite Mexican food.
18696 THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes I've tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side.
18697 Fuego Bistro has quickly become one of my wife and I's favorite restaurants!
18698 We went with a large group the first time and they were great about us having 7, including two smaller children.
18699 Last night my wife and I went back for a date night and had the most wonderful time!
18700 Jeff, the owner, is fantastic and always wants to make sure you have a great time.
18701 The sommelier was also great.
18702 He talked to us about the wine, gave us some tips for pairings, and even had us take a sip of wine while chewing our food.
18703 It totally changed the character of both the wine and food.
18704 Speaking of the food, the short ribs are amazing!
18705 The best sides we've had are the creamed corn and the chipotle mashed potatoes, but the maple chili carrots and the cornbread green chili casserole are also very good!
18706 The cocktails are great and the happy hour menu is pretty reasonable.
18707 We will definitely be going to Fuego on a regular basis!
18708 !
18709 So I knew ahead of time about the wait.
18710 So we got there at 3:30 and waited for an hour and a half until they opened.
18711 But we were able to be seated as soon as they opened.
18712 Let me just say that I've never had anything even close to the kind of pizza that we got.
18713 It's outstanding!
18714 I highly recommend the caprese salad, antipasto and the rosa pizza.
18715 Though I'm pretty sure that it's all amazing, no matter what you get.
18716 Love my Chick-fil-a!
18717 Wow, they have a system and it is super fast in the drive thur.
18718 Amazed and they are always super friendly!
18719 They always get the order right!!!
18720 ++++
18721 DO NOT GO HERE.
18722 One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.
18723 The setup is a little like "Pei Wei" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.
18724 Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.
18725 Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us.
18726 Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would "put it under the heat lamp" for me.
18727 Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed "he had them remake" since it was getting cold.
18728 My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.
18729 We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.
18730 The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.
18731 She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).
18732 He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.
18733 My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.
18734 I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful.
18735 Excellent
18736 Seriously, if you're looking for a place to get your knives sharpened or buy some cool professional kitchen gear, look no further.
18737 Of course it gets hot in the summer.
18738 You're going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / what's going on there might be some idiots 'mawshing'.
18739 Sound quality is great for the size.
18740 Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues.
18741 and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile.
18742 The main & front room have shows as well.
18743 5 BIG STARS
18744 For service and quality of meal, restaurants really don't get any better than this.
18745 Multiple servers, dressed in NY black are constantly there for you.
18746 This restaurant prides itself in using local products & blending them into traditional meals, ala Alice Waters, and they do an excellent job.
18747 For starters, we had (are you ready?
18748 ):
18749 -"Macerated Local Vine Ripened Heirloom Tomatoes, Fossil Creek Goat Cheese & Mascarpone Tart," including Buckwheat & Saguaro Seed Tart, Basil foamed from the garden, Black Ice, and Gila River Olive Oil; and
18750 -"Pan Flashed White & Green Asparagus with Chanterelles & Cholla Buds," including Chanterelle Mushroom Fondue, Desert Quail Egg (sunny side up), Red Currents and Aged Sherry.
18751 And that was just the beginning!
18752 For dinner we had:
18753 -"Veal Ribeye Rubbed with Sandalwood, Dry Mole & Green Chile Sand," including Mesquite Cooked Desert Fruit Chutney, Truffle Frites, and Rutabaga Cobbler; and
18754 -"Local Pecan Crusted Colorado Lamb with Native Seeds SEARCH Mole," including Pastry Tapenade of Fennel, QC Olives, Eggplant, Wild Mushrooms, Heirloom Tomatoes & Iitoi Onions.
18755 Everything was exquisite!
18756 This meal was to die for!
18757 Any complaints at all?
18758 Well, yes, but very minor.
18759 This place is actually in a Sheraton, but I guess that insures a good stream of patrons that can afford such meals.
18760 And the decor?
18761 Not very good.
18762 It needs a serious MAKEOVER.
18763 Wall-hangings, window treatments & carpeting aren't much.
18764 So there you are...
18765 Gymboree, many years ago I brought my first son to Gymboree quite often and really enjoyed.
18766 Never thought I would be back, but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it.
18767 I am very happy to have been reintroduced to Gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week.
18768 The instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children.
18769 Thinking about Gymboree now, my only regret is that I know someday my boy is going to outgrow it, and I want these times to last forever.
18770 Honestly, I can't remember how I found out about Butter & Me, but I'm glad it happened.
18771 My fiancee (now wife!)
18772 and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes.
18773 Kelly at Butter & Me did not disappoint.
18774 She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has *the best* cupcakes in the valley!
18775 Believe me, we taste-tested a number of other vendors and everyone else's cupcakes tasted like small, dry, cakes.
18776 The cupcakes from Butter & Me were exactly what we were looking for.
18777 They were perfectly moist, beautifully decorated, and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from!!
18778 !
18779 I cannot recommend Butter & Me highly enough!
18780 The Yelp review sums it up: "Woohoo!
18781 As good as it gets!"
18782 Bookmans is Great!
18783 They probably don't need another positive review but so what.
18784 I use Bookmans for recycling books I've read and for buying used books for myself.
18785 All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business.
18786 They have great people working there.
18787 The store vibe is very positive.
18788 Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair, plus you know that you've made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy.
18789 Do yourself a favor and stop in.
18790 Enjoy!
18791 Outstanding customer service!!!
18792 Great camping firewood bags!!!
18793 HUGE bags of high quality, long burning wood for $10!!
18794 Cannot be beat!!
18795 !
18796 Cash, check or use the ATM they have in the office ($2 fee).

18798 I LOVE THIS PLACE!
18799 It's so nice to be able to eat here whenever it's chilly outside.
18800 Actually, allow me to be honest, I probably would eat here everyday but I settle for 1-2 times a week.
18801 I get my Pho with extra meatballs and no onions and they make it perfect for me each time!!!
18802 The folks are awesome and no matter how busy it is everything come out SUPER fast!
18803 You know a girl loves to eat in a timely manner with my hectic schedule!
18804 The Springrolls, the crab puffs the chicken fried rice all amazing too!
18805 For a good time time and warm feeling after a FANTASTIC meal this is the best come winter or AZ summer time:)
18806 Just isn't very good.
18807 I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.
18808 It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.
18809 The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.
18810 I've been to this place several times over the years.
18811 This location and others.
18812 It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.
18813 However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.
18814 We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.
18815 It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.
18816 The olives we ordered were rough at best.
18817 UGH even thinking about them.
18818 Overly seasoned and not very fresh.
18819 The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.
18820 The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.
18821 This place needs a rescue.
18822 Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.
18823 As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.
18824 The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty.
18825 Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
18826 I was visiting Tempe for Ironman Arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race.
18827 The friendly receptionist at Dr. Natcher's office understood the predicament I was in and managed to fit me into Dr. Natcher's schedule within a couple hours of my call.
18828 Dr. Natcher's is clearly both a great doctor and a great person; she is extremely competent, friendly, and sympathetic.
18829 As an  runner and cyclist, she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete.
18830 She quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol.
18831 I was in good shape on race day (due to her treatment protocol) and am so very thankful to Dr. Natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion.
18832 I was paying out-of-pocket, and  was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit.
18833 I can't speak highly enough of my experience with Dr. Natcher.
18834 My first visit to Sweet Republic and when I was done my first thought was, "why did I take so long to come here!?"
18835 I sampled a few of their ice creams and let me tell you.
18836 All delicious.
18837 In particular the mint chip ice cream was delicious.
18838 It tastes like fresh mint because get this... it is!
18839 Service was quick and friendly.
18840 We got in right before a rush and let me tell you, the staff were able to handle it like pros.
18841 Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one.
18842 You can tell how proud they are of their creations.
18843 I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose, you will love.
18844 Stop on down, took me 30 minutes to get there from Gilbert, and enjoy a cone or cup.
18845 Do yourself a favor and don't delay for 3 years like I did!
18846 We were craving Mexican food and since we were in the area I decided to check on my trusty yelp app on my phone to find a perfect food joint to check out.
18847 Sure enough, it came through for us and told us about this little gem tucked away in an area I had been several times but had never noticed it before.
18848 I am so very glad I tried it as it will now be my go-to place for Mexican food.
18849 The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced.
18850 The guacamole is a must try and the carne asada is so good.
18851 If you're in the mood for Mexican and in the area, I would definitely recommend this place.
18852 This place is one of my favorite burger joints.
18853 If you really appreciate a good burger, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
18854 Kobe burger, Double truffle fries, Creme Brulee Shake and just pure joy.
18855 First time, the burger was slightly over cooked for medium rare; but ever since I have been back multiple times and it's been prepared perfectly to my expectations.
18856 I do believe in second chances and they won me over.
18857 I don't get the mushroom on the Kobe; Meat is very tasty and flavorful, no need to add any toppings.
18858 The Samburger and Zinburger are very tasty as well.
18859 Last time I added bacon to the Zinburger, very good, and I do recommend that.
18860 The staff are very attentive to diners needs.
18861 I have tried a few of the Fox-RC and every time has been an excellent experience so far.
18862 (I hope it won't change).
18863 SF definitely has a unique and entrepreneurial vision in food industry which has, and will make him very successful.
18864 Seriously soo good!
18865 Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ.
18866 I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it!
18867 Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD!
18868 and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too.
18869 Tried Joe's Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK.
18870 Joe's Farm grill is def.
18871 one of my fav places..
18872 This place is awesome and it replaced Trader Joes as my new grocery store.
18873 The produce is plentiful and fresh, they have Boars Head at the deli, and they have organic options.
18874 The meat is way more reasonably priced than AJs.
18875 It reminds me of a small Whole Foods without the ridiculous prices.
18876 This is Mesa's best breakfast, hands down!
18877 This is one of my family's favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley.
18878 Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting!
18879 I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!
18880 The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style.
18881 Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) .
18882 The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy).
18883 Try their French toast... it's got great flavor and is delightfully crispy.
18884 If you get a chance, try lunch there!
18885 Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for!
18886 The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they don't skimp on the artichokes at all!
18887 The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best I've ever had (I'm not even a fan of dumplings!)!
18888 The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!
18889 ), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich.
18890 Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion!
18891 Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast.
18892 The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so it's great for those who can't decide between breakfast or lunch!
18893 FEZ for brunch on Saturday with a bunch of girlfriends was one of the highlights of my weekend.
18894 Several of us ordered the FEZ Fritatta and it was perfectly cooked with tasty toppings and the best bacon on the side.
18895 I also sampled the sweet potato fries and they were even better than anticipated--a standout.
18896 Plates looked pretty.
18897 C'mon, that's important!
18898 Presentation, people.
18899 Service was superb.
18900 Hadn't been to FEZ in a while and forgot how delicious it is!
18901 Let's go to FEZ more often, girls!
18902 I love this theater!!
18903 it's 100 % digital and very clean and the staff is friendly.
18904 I believe that the have child care if you have any.
18905 also lot's of great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance in the shops @ Norterra.
18906 We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.
18907 I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.
18908 There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different.
18909 The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesn't have the same feel as the Saguaro course.
18910 The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes.
18911 That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play.
18912 Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.
18913 Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.
18914 This has led to some interesting memories.
18915 The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.
18916 He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.
18917 It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes.
18918 Not a chance.
18919 Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed.
18920 He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert.
18921 Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!
18922 Of course, we haven't let him forget the five provisionals...
18923 I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree.
18924 However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.
18925 The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.
18926 She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective.
18927 The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens.
18928 Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them).
18929 Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees.
18930 I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it.
18931 Haus Murphy's is fabulous in so many ways that I can really only hit the highlights here.
18932 Even if German food isn't your favorite (I dislike saurkraut and cabbage), the service and food is great.
18933 The service was wonderful.
18934 I was almost 2 hours earlier than my friends, so I used a table in the bier garden to do some work on my computer (with my own mobile hotspot.
18935 .
18936 .
18937 Haus Murphy's does not have wi-fi).
18938 The entire staff made me feel welcome as a sipped a wonderful German beer and did some work.
18939 My friends showed up, we had great dinners, and then we continued on to Glendale Glitters.
18940 If I'm able to make it over to Glendale from my home in Mesa for Glendale Glows in January, I will certainly stop in Haus Murphy's.
18941 Authentic German or not (I've never been to Germany, my friends of mine who have seemed to really enjoy the food too), this place is worth the visit.
18942 Enjoy!
18943 This has to be the best Thai food around.
18944 I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee.
18945 We are now regulars and have never been disappointed.
18946 Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people.
18947 I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire.
18948 It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years.
18949 Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it.
18950 If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare.
18951 Oh, and the camera is set to fat...
18952 SAKE    *Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice; usually served hot .
18953 ( Full disclosure : I don't like sake)
18954 Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood.
18955 We were on the horns of a dilemma : ?
18956 Would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet?
18957 Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south - north Scottsdale....?
18958 ?
18959 We opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club.
18960 ** A) never drink and drive in Scottsdale ( or anywhere else for that matter)
18961 **B) if you're a foreigner - never- ever drink and drive in Scottsdale
18962 **C) A + B refer to you Nikolai Khabibulin
18963 (( A nod of support to the YELP community .
18964 After perusing the Ocean Club reviews retrospectively I believe the correlation existing between the posted notes and reality to be around 0.90 Well Done!
18965 !
18966 ( I would go as high as a correlation of 0.95 if high and low marks were thrown out ( similar to olympic skating or gymnastics)))
18967 We arrived at the club---- a good bar crowd ( not quite as Mountain lioness(y) as i had expected (?
18968 hoped?)
18969 -- ?
18970 mid week perhaps...?,
18971 a good blend of hipsters , hobos and Mrs Lovey Howell III's
18972 ( score +1 for the Ocean Club)
18973 We were promptly seated - at a good table - well positioned , near the back and partially curtained - nice.
18974 ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club)
18975 The waiter then promptly arrived to take our drink orders:
18976 Now - I don't like Sake ( see note above) - but on occasion - I like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like Sake- hence , I order a Grey Goose Sake Martini -
18977 " I have no Sake" the waiter announces sadly.
18978 Now - this is tricky - can I in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that I really don't like or want in the first place?
18979 Too bad for you Ocean Club 'cause yes I can.
18980 ( score -1 for the Ocean Club)
18981 The drinks arrive - I have opted for Grey Goose sans Sake
18982 and yes -sweet Jesus  they are huge ( see prior posts).
18983 ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club)
18984 The waiter then arrives to review the menu and describe the specials-
18985 This he does without note , blackboard , evening card or inked cheat note on his wrist-
18986 He recites for what seems to be forever...
18987 It is like a reading from the old testament - but instead of a mere chapter of the book of Leviticus - he recites the entire book....
18988 I am captivated ....( or is it the Grey Goose)
18989 ??
18990 does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont...?
18991 ?
18992 ??
18993 does he really know the glove size of the Japanese ranch worker who massaged the Wagyu beef and from which prefecture he hailed...?
18994 ?
18995 ( if so - why didn't he have him send me some Sake....??)
18996 at any rate - I am entertained
18997 ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club)
18998 The food arrives - the portions are huge and the flavors sublime.
18999 ( at this point in the evening my memory fades into Grey Goose and Châteauneuf-du-Pape...... is that Joan Rivers - across the bar making eyes at me....?? )
19000 ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club)
19001 dessert arrives, sated ,  - we cannot really eat any more but I remember thinking that the desserts may be the best I have tried outside Europe-
19002 ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club)
19003                                                     * * * * *
19004 Adding it all up five stars and a promise to find a way to post six stars next time I am there if they find me some gosh darn Sake!
19005 !
19006 Best in south chandler.
19007 Glad they are out here
19008 What a find.
19009 In a strip mall nestled between a bank, clothing stores and overnight shipping is Giuseppe's.
19010 A family owned and run establishment where byob is the way to go.
19011 This reminds me of countless small mom and pop's back in The City.
19012 The staff is friendly, the portions sizable and the check small to medium.
19013 In fact, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant before.
19014 Whether on a date, or with the family, I've never had a bad experience in the dozens of times I've been there.
19015 From the veal parmagian (sp?)
19016 to the eggplant, from the fettucine to the spaghetti and meatbeals... mama mia.
19017 It is a small venue, with very limited outdoors seating during good weather.
19018 And the locals know about it, so it gets pretty packed Thursday through Sunday.
19019 The salads and appetizers are delicious as well...
19020 If this restaurant had been in Spinal Tap, it would get "an eleven"...
19021 I've been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go, along with their fresh feta, pitas and cucumber yogurt.
19022 BEST I'VE HAD!
19023 Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG, it was delis and the prices are fabulous.
19024 I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow, it was UNREAL!
19025 I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice (basmati?)
19026 and it was fabulous.
19027 Gyro Greek salad was amazing too.
19028 I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet!!!!
19029 !
19030 I recommend you try this little gem!!
19031 It's worth the drive!
19032 Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY.
19033 Folks I know from Western NY love this place, and I have to agree (even though I'll still take a good Chicago dog any day).
19034 I know where I'll be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot.
19035 :)
19036 I love everything about Oregano's!
19037 My first experience was in Flagstaff with a location being right off NAU's campus, and I was thrilled more started to open up in the valley.
19038 There is one in Mesa, now, very close to me, and the ambiance remains the same.
19039 I love the vintage decoration, the music, usually Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz icons, and the FOOD!
19040 All the appetizers are amazing, especially the Boom Dip.
19041 My favorite pizza is the O-Riva.
19042 And passing up the Pizzookie (pizza cookie) is out of the question, get your friends to dive into this amazing desert.
19043 Also the bellinis are outstanding!
19044 Enjoy your experience here, you will fall in love!
19045 Have patience at the smaller locations, usually there will be a wait.
19046 The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical, they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business.
19047 Ever since moving to the new premises, things have sucked.
19048 I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.
19049 best place in scottsdale to watch a game.
19050 Great food (greasy, but what bar food isn't?
19051 ), great drink specials, and an even better atmosphere.
19052 The owner came by and greeted us and made us feel very welcome.
19053 I will definitely return in the future.
19054 I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.
19055 I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.
19056 On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.
19057 My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and "Small Business Saturday" I thought "why not give them another try", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).
19058 I won't go back in there.
19059 The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.
19060 The second time was enough to make my blood boil.
19061 We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.
19062 The guy came over and said "Oh, I have another one in the box" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.
19063 We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.
19064 I looked at the cashier and my husband and said "NOT cool at all" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.
19065 I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.
19066 New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.
19067 I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.
19068 Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.
19069 When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores.
19070 I have been a "regular" customer at this salon ever since it opened.
19071 At first it was great!
19072 Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.
19073 After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.
19074 I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.
19075 She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.
19076 I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.
19077 I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ...
19078 The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.
19079 I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.
19080 Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.
19081 It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.
19082 I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.
19083 The "massage" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.
19084 He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.
19085 Definitely not worth the $25.
19086 The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.
19087 The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.
19088 This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received.
19089 Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back.
19090 I'm addicted!
19091 Everyone there is so freakin nice.
19092 And Maui dogs are delicious.
19093 We attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 p.m. and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff.
19094 Both were first class.
19095 We decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did.
19096 One young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food.
19097 It really was fun to watch the whole process.
19098 We decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that.
19099 We each ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled Kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions.
19100 Alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings.
19101 They were absolutely delicious and I was so sad to reach the end of those.
19102 The steak was cooked to absolute perfection and I was determined to clean my plate because it, too, was just so scrumptious!
19103 It was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert, unfortunately.
19104 As our cocktail, we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos, which were $9.50/ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert stand-in so the tab wasn't too crazy at all.
19105 Well worth it for that delicious steak.
19106 We did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice.
19107 It's fun to have the whole experience for a special night out.
19108 We look forward to returning soon.
19109 We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention.
19110 "Oh, Okay!"
19111 - I thought and walked right in.
19112 We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying!
19113 The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi!
19114 It wasn't as fresh as I expected.
19115 The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty.
19116 By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced.
19117 Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far.
19118 This place is as good as it gets for shooting.
19119 I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).
19120 The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).
19121 The club is huge (140 acres).
19122 There is a main range for members and the public.
19123 Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.
19124 You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.
19125 The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.
19126 I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend.
19127 Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it.
19128 I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses.
19129 What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls.
19130 More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area.
19131 Killer staff and great food.
19132 I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef.
19133 They said they grind it themselves.
19134 The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type.
19135 The beans were different.
19136 They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon.
19137 I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out.
19138 It ended up being a little expensive.
19139 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans.
19140 Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch.
19141 My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120.
19142 even with a coupon!!!
19143 When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasn't the best...
19144 I really don't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a 'coupon' it wasn't worth it.
19145 Won't be back...
19146 Being a former band nerd in high school, so much nostalgia kicked in upon entering the museum.
19147 I saw all the instruments I was familiar with in high school, and many others that I wasn't familiar with (and learned much about).
19148 They supply you with headphones and a wireless receiver that plays the audio/video of the different sections you walk into.
19149 Each plays a sample of what the instruments sound like and some give detailed history on the instrument.
19150 Very enlightening experience.
19151 Best Part IMO: They have a room where you get to test random instruments to your heart's content!
19152 I really wanted to go ham on the gong but there was a sign that said something along the lines of "do not hit the gong repeatedly".
19153 I was disappoint... but otherwise many other instruments in there kept me occupied for awhile (xylophone, conga, harp, etc)
19154 It's not an arm and a leg to get inside, and this place has something for everybody.
19155 You're sure to spend a few hours enjoying yourself here.
19156 If you're going to do anything in Phoenix, this is one of the spots you should definitely check out.
19157 Went here for our anniversary.
19158 Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.
19159 Yes, it's pricey.
19160 Steaks were good and service was attentive.
19161 A good place to celebrate.
19162 Dinner for four at the soft opening.
19163 The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night.
19164 Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly.
19165 The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite!
19166 Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation.
19167 Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous!
19168 Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing.
19169 ahhhh, sigh.
19170 I think I'd pass up the tater tots and save room for something else.
19171 This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs.
19172 Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy.
19173 Good God, where has this been hiding?
19174 My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem.
19175 From his kids, no less.
19176 We went during the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour...on a Friday night.
19177 We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us.
19178 Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away.
19179 The cosmos and appletinis were $4 and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $5 and numerous rolls were $5 each; how do you beat that?
19180 The food was spectacular.
19181 We ordered off of the regular menu (2 orders or tuna tataki, 2 orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can't seem to remember).
19182 OMG, one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD.
19183 This was some seriously great sushi...Bravo Yen Sushi!
19184 Our bill for 6 peeps was $96, that's with the tip included, no less...YAY!
19185 I will definitely be back.
19186 This place was great.
19187 When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at "The BEST pizza in the country" i Was skeptical.
19188 Best pizza in Phoenix?
19189 Well, I wasn't disappointed!
19190 We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu:
19191 Apps:
19192 Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese
19193 Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm
19194 Pizza:
19195 MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil
19196 MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese)
19197 ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios
19198 SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives
19199 BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula
19200 WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage
19201 Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite!
19202 I don't eat pork, so I couldn't sample them all, but I'd happily order this one again.
19203 In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this.
19204 Their house draft beer is also quite tasty!
19205 Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation!
19206 They don't take reservations for smaller groups and I've heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times!
19207 But worth it!
19208 Ok this place was great...so great I decided to sign up on yelp and contribute to the rave reviews that encouraged me to try it out in the first place.
19209 I had the fish tacos happy hour appetizer for dinner and they we cooked and seasoned well.
19210 They were really good and I would definitely order again.
19211 I was told it is off season in August, but the place was filled with locals; all very welcoming.
19212 Everyone knew everyone and if they didn't (like me) it didn't take long to feel like one of the locals.
19213 Great service, too.
19214 Will definitely go back!
19215 While my visit, to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur, the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered.
19216 My buddy did all the ordering, so all of it was a surprise, when I sat down to eat.
19217 Quite possibly the best Hot-and-Sour soup I've had IN MY LIFE, and all of the everything else that was ordered, was smack yo' mama good.
19218 The fried rice, and lo-mein were divine (especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me) and the EGG FOO YUNG = EGG FOO YUM.
19219 I've had much more bad Egg Foo Yung than I have had good Egg Foo Yung.. to the point that I never think to order it, cuz it usually SUCKS, but SO NOT THE CASE at Diamond's!
19220 The lady at the register = super cute, and I kinda like the "stab joint" classic chinese restaurant looks of this place.. no windows!
19221 YES!
19222 :D Five stars... the food seriously speaks for itself.
19223 Ok food.
19224 Super slow!!
19225 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..
19226 I absolutely LOVE this place.
19227 Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona, and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location (to my knowledge) still doesn't have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have.
19228 The crust is always perfect, the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it, and the cheese and toppings are flawless.
19229 On top of having some of the best pizza in town, their customer service is top-notch.
19230 If you haven't tried Spinato's yet, put it on your to-do list!
19231 Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp.
19232 My fan was running excessively.
19233 The mechanic came and looked at my car.
19234 The coolant was low.
19235 He grabbed a can and filled it up.
19236 No charge.
19237 I then told him I needed new struts.
19238 He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago.
19239 I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me.
19240 The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold.
19241 It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy.
19242 Made an appt.
19243 Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised.
19244 The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty.
19245 Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s?
19246 Hopefully I won't have a need to go back, but if I do, I'd gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again.
19247 I went for family birthday on a Friday night.
19248 Only a few people in dining room eating.
19249 (1st clue to leave.)
19250 Ordered a margarita.
19251 It's extra to have it shaken...
19252 But I ordered that way.
19253 It was mostly sour mix.
19254 An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?
19255 (2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner!
19256 (3rd clue to run!)
19257 Very disappointing.
19258 I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them.
19259 Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8.
19260 Salsa was good.
19261 I will never go back.
19262 Good luck Salty.
19263 I love your decor.
19264 Why don't you care you could be so cool!
19265 I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far, far, away from the tuna.
19266 I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home, but I found it in the form of this cold, barely-recognizable-as-food sandwich.
19267 I think I'd prefer eating tuna out of the can over this.
19268 Love Love LOVE Baker's Nursery!!
19269 Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents (my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago).
19270 Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!
19271 Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?
19272 Bring in a leaf or bark sample and they'll tell you.
19273 Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!
19274 ), Lantana (evil and will not die!
19275 ), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!)
19276 and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard.
19277 Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?
19278 Just ask!
19279 Need something transplanted?
19280 Buy the pots and they'll replant your plants for you.
19281 Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, they'll tell you how to nurse it back to health.
19282 I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!
19283 :)
19284 Over the top cheesesteaks.
19285 Best in Phoenix, perhaps the world.
19286 Amazing food and friendly service.
19287 Best ever.
19288 My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left.
19289 The service, quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive.
19290 Go to Sens instead.
19291 Bacado.
19292 Yes, you read that correctly....
19293 The "Bacado".
19294 It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes.
19295 Decent black coffee and good service.
19296 Delicious.
19297 Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap.
19298 I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go.
19299 I got home, there's lettuce and mayo and... what this?
19300 what's this I see in this sandwich?
19301 there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce?
19302 (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.)
19303 Ewwww.... gross....
19304 I didn't finish the sandwich.
19305 Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's, particularly not the one on Shea.
19306 Disgusting.
19307 If it ever happens again, I'm calling a local news station to report it, then I'll call the state health department.
19308 Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU.
19309 Not a place to go if you like wraps.
19310 Green....how I love thee.
19311 Green may be vegan/vegetarian, but I certainly wouldn't claim it to be 'health' food.
19312 Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.
19313 It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!
19314 The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.
19315 I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.
19316 I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).
19317 I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.
19318 I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).
19319 Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!
19320 !
19321  (On one Saturday evening around 6:30 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go, the place had a line out the door and it took about 30-45 min to get our food.
19322 We weren't even upset about the wait, just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized.
19323 THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE!)
19324 Love this place so much!
19325 Excellent macaroons!
19326 Great owners very conversant with their costumers.
19327 Best pizza place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19328 !
19329 Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato I've had outside of Italy.
19330 I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!....
19331 I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here.
19332 The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES!
19333 I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....
19334 We checked out the prices at The Dump, the sales person there just were too pushy.
19335 and their prices were not the lowest.
19336 We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper.
19337 We had a wonderful experience!
19338 The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all.
19339 They had the i-select model bed that my friend was looking for.
19340 They were $200 cheaper, delivery was cheaper, and free tempur pedic pillows.
19341 SOLD!!!
19342 My friend is happy as a customer.
19343 We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctor's office and staff that I have ever found.
19344 Every employee here genuinely cares about you.
19345 I highly recommend.
19346 Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?
19347 Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).
19348 Without Dave's personality, this place just doesn't cut it.
19349 Will never go here again.
19350 Bummer.
19351 Best damn Brownies on the planet (or close to it)!
19352 Words cannot explain how good they are.
19353 The only negative is that this palce is located across the street from my office!
19354 Way too much temptation.
19355 Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.
19356 After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the "OPEN" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.
19357 I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.
19358 We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.
19359 Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected "Butai").
19360 When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?
19361 I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said "We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..." and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.
19362 She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.
19363 I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.
19364 After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...
19365 When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.
19366 Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?
19367 Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?
19368 I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.
19369 For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...
19370 I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.
19371 The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.
19372 The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.
19373 My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).
19374 She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.
19375 I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?
19376 Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!
19377 When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?)
19378 either.
19379 Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!
19380 I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.
19381 I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.
19382 Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...
19383 I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.
19384 Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.
19385 i tried the thai river noodles.
19386 they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl.
19387 but the thai noodles, they were good.
19388 i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here.
19389 and the food in inconsistent.
19390 oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining.
19391 just watch....
19392 this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed).
19393 but it is a good one nonetheless.
19394 What an amazing place!!
19395 I had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the Royal Palms Resort, and recommend it highly.
19396 So many excellent points:  absolutely gorgeous accommodations, polite and helpful staff, excellent restaurant (breakfast/ brunch outside, with a delicious cup of coffee, is a must), a great spa, and a relaxing atmosphere.
19397 My boyfriend and I stayed here for a conference in late October, which is a great season in Arizona.
19398 Our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end.
19399 The resort is well-suited for special occasions (there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay).
19400 Our room was very comfortable, with excellent set-up and a great view of the mountains from the balcony.
19401 The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).
19402 There are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort, and downtown Scottsdale is 10-15 minutes away by car.
19403 In all, a beautiful place for a special occasion!
19404 This is my favorite coffee spot in AZ.
19405 They know how to make a fantastic Americano.
19406 They use very good coffee and a real European espresso machine.
19407 I hate those machines that Starbucks uses with the coffee storage on top and the preset grinders.
19408 YUCK.
19409 The cafe has a comfortable and welcoming Vice.
19410 Everyone will say hello to you when you walk in the door.
19411 They do have free wifi, but it is REAL SLOW!!
19412 That is my only complaint.
19413 They need to crank it up!
19414 Can I review some of the people who go here?
19415 Because I know one idiot who would get 1 star.
19416 (But the park still gets a 5)
19417 One dude let his dog pee on me!
19418 And the little bugger was fast!
19419 He'd prance toward you, and before you knew it, his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon!
19420 My friend was tinkled on multiple times; she wasn't able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant.
19421 Did the man say anything?
19422 Only that his dog was only nervous.
19423 Are you kidding me?
19424 Alright, I got your number.
19425 In return, we very actively encouraged our Australian Shepherd to play with the little terrier.
19426 Why?
19427 Because the Aussie Shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park, and the little pissing terrier (who only likes to pee on people, not trees or anywhere else in the park) ended up DRIPPING the Aussie Shep's saliva.
19428 Sweet!
19429 (that was the only time we didn't feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs).
19430 Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food....
19431 Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait... be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere...
19432 Good seafood is hard to find in Az & Farm grill does a great job.... also great burgers!
19433 If you don't mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area..
19434 my family and i hosted my sister's graduation sendoff here and it was a great event!
19435 debbie in the events office as well as the staff she sent us to be of service throughout the event were wonderful.
19436 food was delicious - we ordered buffet style (chicken milanese, sirloin steak, appetizers, and beverages) for about 150 people.
19437 the tech staff was very helpful in setting up our equipment for a slide show as well as providing equipment for us to play our own music at the event.
19438 servers were polite and accomodating to any of the guests' requests.
19439 and the facility is beautiful.
19440 they even let me go super early in the morning being the type A personality i am to decorate myself and set things up.
19441 overall wonderful experience with this resort and its staff.
19442 would love to host another event here in the future.
19443 thanks, scottsdale plaza resort!
19444 Went here last night for the first time in years.
19445 I used to hang out all the time here when I was younger.
19446 It was packed by 1030.
19447 Great music mostly top 40 and hip hop..no techno yay!
19448 Good looking crowd and not as pretentious and the rest of Scottsdale.
19449 Everyone had a blast..dancing everywhere.
19450 Friendly crowd.
19451 Reasonably priced drinks for Scottsdale.
19452 I cannot wait to come back.
19453 Patties still has it!
19454 One of the most impressive spots in town.
19455 Lunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable.
19456 Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client.
19457 For dinner they will take your shorts, though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable, elegant evening.
19458 Life is too short - try this restaurant soon!
19459 I have yet to stay here (Royal Palms hotel) - but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire.
19460 A few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio, I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta!
19461 This visit was yet again, AMAZING!
19462 First off, Kimberly, our waitress, was the most personable, helpful, awesome waitress ever!
19463 She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers.
19464 I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she assured me it was to-die-for.
19465 She was not lying, it was delicious!
19466 They also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio.
19467 Then, to top it off, the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself.
19468 Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back!
19469 So hospitable!
19470 I felt like I had a second royal treatment!
19471 Thanks Brio, you guys are awesome!!
19472 :)
19473 Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night.
19474 We made reservations and were a little late getting there,  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed.
19475 Atmosphere is very nice.
19476 Beautiful building and a nice layout.
19477 Next time we plan to eat in the bar.
19478 We had to try Bob's Big Burger and what a big burger it was!
19479 Quality meat (bacon was to die for).
19480 Big onion, big tomato.
19481 What more could you ask for?
19482 Mr. McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves.
19483 Great guy!
19484 And our waiter was very attentive (not pushy) but always seemed to show up at the right time.
19485 We plan on going back for sure.
19486 Give it a try.
19487 You won't be disappointed.
19488 Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS "Check Please, Arizona".
19489 He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry.
19490 Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us.
19491 So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft.
19492 Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat!
19493 Lots of sugar free flavors too!
19494 Mmm!
19495 I was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant!
19496 This place is STYLISH - whether it's the plush lounge chairs on the patio, or the old school movies being projected on the walls - there's definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district.
19497 First impressions were extremely positive - the place was busy but not packed, candlelit tables, and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date, but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable, formal, anxiety feeling.
19498 La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans.
19499 I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu.
19500 Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.
19501 I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.
19502 My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!
19503 Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.
19504 Needless to say we will be returning!
19505 Stop here every time I'm in town!
19506 The spring on our garage door broke and we had no idea who to call.
19507 Lodi was recommended to us but they werne't specific as there are a few under this name.
19508 I choose Lodi Garage Doors & More and was stunned they sent someone out within 1.5 hours!
19509 They also quoted me on the phone and were so nice in setting up the appointment and calling back to confirm.
19510 Gene was our technician, he was efficient, friendly and did a fantastic job.
19511 I will be passing Lodi's name on for sure and if repairs are needed in the future I will not hesitate to call!
19512 Thank you for you quick, professional, friendly service!
19513 Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact.
19514 Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us.
19515 Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server.
19516 I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not.
19517 This last experience, was about a year after the last.
19518 I thought maybe they would have changed.
19519 I most definitely thought wrong!
19520 We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time.
19521 However, our food took FOREVER!
19522 Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta.
19523 I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room).
19524 The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was.
19525 Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again.
19526 Fabulous!
19527 Great views (obviously) of the city.
19528 Very romantic.
19529 Amazing wine list.
19530 Superb service.
19531 Delicious menu.
19532 Luis was our server - great guy full of very helpful information (especially wine pairings).
19533 LOVE the lobster bisque (I'm usually not a fan of lobster or bisque).
19534 Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried.
19535 I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee.
19536 Highly recommend if you're bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if you'd like a romantic night out.
19537 If I could give it more than 5, I would.
19538 Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.
19539 We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.
19540 It has exceeded our expectations.
19541 The atmosphere is amazing.
19542 The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.
19543 They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.
19544 Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?
19545 Happy hours are amazing.
19546 New Year's Eve last year was amazing.
19547 The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.
19548 But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that you'll ever meet.
19549 Go here.
19550 You will love it.
19551 This review is for locals...the Hyatt isn't just a beautiful spot to stay it, it's also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day!
19552 I've done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio.
19553 Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done.
19554 They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming.
19555 For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake.
19556 They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake!
19557 It doesn't get much better than that.
19558 I love Mexican food.
19559 Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either.
19560 The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor.
19561 The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper.
19562 The beans were flavorless.
19563 The rice was hard and lacked any flavor.
19564 Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable.
19565 This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had.
19566 It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste.
19567 The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.
19568 The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted.
19569 The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.
19570 I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback, in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.
19571 No luck.
19572 Didn't even get a response.
19573 They will not be getting any more of my business.
19574 Too bad because I'd actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.
19575 But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back.
19576 I've been to this Dick's location a bunch of times and I've got to say that I've gotten more help from the employees in this one that I've ever gotten from any other location.
19577 I've spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and they're always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them.
19578 Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience.
19579 Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didn't have and L's left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L.  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (I've worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home).
19580 I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off!
19581 I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didn't want to be running around looking for these shorts.
19582 Think I'm joking?
19583 lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/
19584 Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area.
19585 Never had an issue there.
19586 I found some great t-shirts for friends here, including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull.
19587 If you're a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one, then this is the place to go.
19588 Plus, the clerk was using a Mac (not that I would expect anything different, but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr.
19589 Clerk).
19590 Excellent wings.
19591 I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose.
19592 It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it.
19593 They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :(
19594 The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great.
19595 The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad.
19596 All I can say is, "What the hell?
19597 Where has this been my whole life?"
19598 The soup is magical.
19599 Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves.
19600 I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic.
19601 It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago.
19602 Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more.
19603 Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties.
19604 Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat.
19605 Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00.
19606 I was stunned.
19607 The owner said it costs more with meat.
19608 Believe me, you won't miss it.
19609 Who knew that magic was so cheap?
19610 Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.
19611 I had a great experience.
19612 Nice people.
19613 My minnie poodle mix looked great and was happy when he came out!
19614 Total bill: $43 + tip including cut, blow dry, ears,  toenails, anal glands and teeth.
19615 Located in the Goodwill parking lot.
19616 This is my first dog, and my first experience with a groomer.
19617 I called on a Saturday and had to make an appointment for the next Saturday, so they are busy.
19618 I asked the front desk guy where the price/package list was.
19619 He said they didn't really have a 'list' so I told him what I needed and I wanted to know how much it would be.
19620 He went in back and the groomer came out to take a look at him and talk to me.
19621 She quoted me $38 and I asked how much for teeth, she added on $5.
19622 They gave me a guide to determine how short I wanted him cut and asked me specifics on what type of cut (I said shave him, it's summer).
19623 they asked about ears, tail, etc.
19624 I brought him in at 9 and they had me pick him up at 1.
19625 I don't know a lot about grooming yet but they said depending on how he was under the blower he might need to be kennel dried.
19626 When I came back at 1 they were finishing up his head.
19627 I can imagine he might have been a tough client, given that he is still puppy-hyper and not yet accustomed to the spa treatment.
19628 He was blow dried for sure; His former curly hair was completely straight and soft.
19629 The shop is no frills.
19630 No pretty sign out front and no decorating inside.
19631 I think they could make more money with some product around or maybe charge more if there was a little more spa feeling when you walk in, but I will go back again for sure.
19632 My poodle mix is 6 months old and this was his second cut.
19633 (The first was done by a family member).
19634 My poor puppy went in looking like a mess and I didn't recognize him when he came out!
19635 He was soft, had a nice cut and smelled great, even his breath!
19636 Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?!
19637 I would take them any day over Subway.
19638 Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin.
19639 This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke.
19640 Okay...I said it.
19641 Judge me.
19642 I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good.
19643 I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.
19644 They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.
19645 I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews.
19646 The service is good.
19647 We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered.
19648 I had a salmon with caper butter sauce.
19649 The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
19650 I think that they have the BEST pizza in town!!!!
19651 Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!!!!
19652 !
19653 What can I say, this place has it all.
19654 Great service, a hugh variety of food to choose from.
19655 I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza, but I could go on forever with all my favorites.
19656 Check out there craft beers too.
19657 Simply delicious.
19658 Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end.
19659 I wish I had known of Bertha's while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.
19660 I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.
19661 Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.
19662 As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.
19663 Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.
19664 I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.
19665 The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.
19666 Bertha's is awesome, fresh sando's, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.
19667 Bertha's please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!
19668 Truly the best pizza I've had so far in AZ.
19669 Reminded me of NY pizza, thin crust... and crusty!
19670 I could eat this crust alone it's so good!..
19671 In fact I did!!!
19672 Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy!
19673 Also had the antipasti, so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad... you have to try this place if you haven't already.
19674 My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers... and we are BIG eaters!
19675 RICO!!
19676 !
19677 Hot fudge Sunday was watered down so much.
19678 You would do much better by going to mcdonalds.
19679 This isn't the first time.
19680 I should quit giving this place chances.
19681 I'm disappointed every time.
19682 I once asked for hot fudge on the bottom of my sundae and was charged $2.60 more.
19683 The staff is rarely friendly.
19684 They should consider being friendly since it IS Dairy Queen, a place that takes many of us back to our childhoods.
19685 The array of desserts are so wonderful why not serve them wonderfully and with a smile, and not like you hate your job and just want to go home?
19686 This is a fancy fine dining restaurant with a casual feel.
19687 The food is definitely under priced.
19688 For most of the summer, drinks are cheap and food is half off for the all day happy hour to entice the locals.
19689 During the winter, you can't get into this place.
19690 It is packed, so reservation is recommend.
19691 The food is described as American Southwest.
19692 The best three choices to have for the first visit.
19693 Is the Famous "BIG_ASS" Burger, Green Chile Pork Stew, & Lamb Fondue.
19694 These choices will hit the spot and hit the wallet for 10 bucks with tip a person.
19695 Simply put this place is AWESOME.
19696 If you're looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area, this is the place to be.
19697 So far I've only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there.
19698 However, don't show up with out being ready to put in your two cents, its needed to keep the ball going, I thought it was really good.
19699 I can't wait to go back!
19700 I love Jimmy Johns.
19701 It is WAY better than Subway.
19702 The bread is what makes it.
19703 They bake their own bread right in the store and then right before they make your sandwich, they pluck out the middle of the bread to fill your sandwich with goodness.
19704 You choose your sandwiches by number, but you can customize any sandwich.
19705 I usually get the #4 which is a Tom Turkey.
19706 It has turkey, lettuce, tomato, lettuce and sprouts on it.
19707 I like their chips too.
19708 They call them Jimmy Chips.
19709 They are the kettle cooked type.
19710 I personally do not think this is your ordinary sandwich.
19711 The combination of bread and ingredients makes it a great sandwich and they are fast to prepare.
19712 I had my brows done one month ago.
19713 Heather did an amazing job!
19714 I went back after 2 weeks for a "no charge" touch up.
19715 I haven't worn brow powder or pencil since, and most importantly my brows look TOTALLY natural.
19716 I give her 5 stars and would strongly recommend her.
19717 As a matter of fact I am going to go back and have my lips done!
19718 I'm not one for hyperbole, but this may have been
19719 THE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!
19720 !
19721 I'd like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals:
19722 1.
19723 To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again.
19724 The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.
19725 I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce!
19726 2.
19727 To our server, Richard.
19728 Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.
19729 You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.
19730 I don't know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute.
19731 3.
19732 To the pastry chef, Country.
19733 Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!
19734 The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles.
19735 Thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner!
19736 This Chipotle Rocks!
19737 Today, I express my joy
19738 In the haiku form!
19739 Perfect fast food joint;
19740 Fresh, delicious, quick and kind.
19741 The price is right, too!
19742 Burritos galore;
19743 In a tortilla or bowl.
19744 But wait, there is more!
19745 Three steak tacos, please!
19746 Or grilled veggie fajitas?
19747 Oh sweet perfection.
19748 A simple menu,
19749 Yet so many decisions.
19750 How can you go wrong?
19751 Answer:  You cannot!
19752 Order now, you won't regret,
19753 This Chipotle Rocks!
19754 Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy.
19755 my son loves the splash pad!
19756 His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to!
19757 There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,
19758 We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy.
19759 Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous.
19760 They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it.
19761 One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working.
19762 We had a great experience.
19763 I love this place!
19764 This was the 4th and final stop on our search for a great dive bar in Old Town.
19765 Coach House was just was the doctor ordered, that is if the doctor had ordered you to find a great dive bar.
19766 I'm still trying to find a doctor who will do that.
19767 Anyway, from the minute we walked up to the guy checking ID's it was a great experience.
19768 Everyone was friendly and chill.
19769 People actually talked to you and were having a good time.
19770 It was a great mix of people.
19771 We played pinball with some guy we met who I renamed the Pinball Wizard.
19772 I also found out that I am not as good at pinball after I have been drinking.
19773 Apparently if affects your hand eye coordination or something like that.
19774 Who knew?
19775 ;)
19776 We also had fun hanging out with some other dudes we met there, and my drinks were $4.25.
19777 What more could I ask for?
19778 Great bar, great night!
19779 This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town.
19780 It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks.
19781 What more could you ask for?
19782 Service is great and the bathrooms are clean.
19783 The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife.
19784 You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge.
19785 If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often.
19786 Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating.
19787 It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded.
19788 This is not a good place to dance.
19789 There is actually no dance floor.
19790 But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks...
19791 Have you not tried Which Wich yet?
19792 Do it.
19793 Buffalo chicken= hands down, my favorite sandwich ever in the world.
19794 I can't wait to get pregnant so I have an excuse to eat them every day.
19795 I used to go to one in CO all the time and I really remembered loving it- when I found out one had opened by my work, it secured a regular spot on my lunch-break rotation until I realized maybe I shouldn't be eating sandwiches all week.
19796 I now prefer to hit up the AJ's next door for cheap tea and salad bar (healthier, obviously) but sometimes I wind up in the parking lot of AJ's only to instead go over to Which Wich... it's seriously delicious stuff.
19797 My husband love the Thanksgiving Turkey feast sandwich (probably has a cooler name than that) and my backup fave is the chicken pesto (be sure to add bacon.)
19798 Always- and I do mean ALWAYS- get your sandwich toasted.
19799 Trust me.
19800 I'm a fattie who loves her some good sandwiches.
19801 My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.
19802 Even with that, the food was super yummy.
19803 I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.
19804 the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.
19805 The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.
19806 It's a must go if you are around the area.
19807 I've searched the world for the perfect pepperoni pizza.
19808 I've searched it over and over again.
19809 Damn it man!
19810 I've wasted my life searching and searching to the farthest corners of the earth to find that saucy cheesy meaty delite!
19811 Only to find that my favorite pepperoni pizza will always be Barro's,  a restaurant just around the corner from where I grew up.
19812 I loathe you, you tasty cheesy bastards...oh, and can I have a large pepperoni to go?
19813 Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle!
19814 Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!)
19815 Pickles are awesome too!
19816 Food is consistent and really good.
19817 Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices.
19818 Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces.
19819 Overall a really good sandwich!
19820 Another 5 star review.
19821 I saw Beauty and the Beast with my little niece last night and she couldn't stop talking about it.
19822 (It was her reward for having good grades)
19823 I know I'm supposed to be the reviewing the theater, but I can't bring myself to rate them lower than 5.
19824 It was such a good show that even though there were a few minor issues at the theater,  they still deserve 5 stars.
19825 The auditorium is starting to show its age and hopefully they get the funding to make improvements.
19826 (Also some lady with a big head sat in front of us and my little niece couldn't see, so I changed seats with her.)
19827 No big deal.
19828 Other than that the staff were very professional and helpful as always.
19829 Thank you again to yelp, Lindsey and to Gammage for giving us complimentary tickets.
19830 My little niece and I appreciates it and we enjoyed the show.
19831 :)
19832 This place is delicious.
19833 Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff.
19834 I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.
19835 We love 5th and Wine and recommend it to anyone that asks, the appetizers and wine specials for Happy Hour are some of the best in town.
19836 Let's start off with the fact that every glass of wine on the wine list, that's right every glass, is just $5 during Happy Hour from 3 - 6 pm.
19837 Did someone mention appetizers?
19838 Yep, 5th has you covered there too.
19839 Ever tried Fried Pickles?
19840 Love them!
19841 But I have to admit it took some convincing to win us over... thanks Scott!
19842 The fried pickles are thinly cut, fried to perfection and served with a creamy horseradish sauce for dipping.
19843 But what 5th and Wine is really known for at Happy Hour is their Bruchetta.
19844 They have 6 types to try but may we recommend this selection of our favorites: Apple and Brie; Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella; and the Steak and Horseradish.
19845 It's a great threesome!
19846 As someone mentioned last night, the bread is not too hard, very flavorful and toasted just right.
19847 Read the entire review here... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=680
19848 very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)
19849 I dropped in to @SweetRepublic, finally, because they tweeted about their Chocolate Guinness, and a limited edition Jameson Irish Cream.
19850 I have had their ice cream in the past, both from the truck, and at other events, and was already a fan.
19851 Now, I'm fanatical.
19852 The Jameson was amazingly good!
19853 I couldn't believe how well the flavor was represented, without having the harshness of the alcohol bite.
19854 But the Chocolate Guinness won the day.
19855 It was so good, I ordered a pint to take home.
19856 (Unexplainably, it is still in the freezer.
19857 I will remedy that today!)
19858 The location is right by my work, so I anticipate returning, again and again.
19859 Jan and Helen are wonderful girls, and they have created something truly amazing.
19860 I congratulate them, and look forward to more of their creations.
19861 And their commitment to using local ingredients makes me happy to spend my money there, rather than a chain, who doesn't concern themselves with the area.
19862 Tasty fair trade organic coffee and breakfast and lunch.
19863 Even have almond milk!
19864 Excellent choices.
19865 Super nice people.
19866 Comfortable space.
19867 Let's help support these independent shops who exude caring, quality and individuality to thrive in our community!
19868 The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like.
19869 WARNING!!!
19870 You will want to spend money!
19871 On average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept.
19872 store style, it is their selection that is amazing.
19873 They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to.
19874 The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find.
19875 One final note, while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals.
19876 I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a 20% discount.
19877 Again, not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once, not having to look around, and still getting $2 back for every $10 I spend is pretty darn nice!
19878 Oh and if you need appliances, ask for Andy/Andrew...
19879 He is a great help and honest as can be!
19880 Lots of awesome stores!
19881 Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.
19882 Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!
19883 New owners are awesome!!!!!
19884 Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.
19885 The restaurant is beautiful too.
19886 My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.
19887 Go check them out!!!
19888 !
19889 Another excellent find in Scottsdale.
19890 The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions.
19891 The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended.
19892 Absolutely fabulous espresso place!
19893 The owner and staff are gracious and friendly, but most importantly they get coffee!
19894 I didn't have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato -- they just made it perfectly!
19895 I'll be here every time I visit Chandler!
19896 What a crap airline!
19897 If I could give them zero stars I would.
19898 I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.
19899 The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.
19900 I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say "Thank you US Airwarys" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!
19901 I will never fly United again!
19902 This is one of my favorite theaters.
19903 With that said, I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre-teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening.
19904 If you're like me, safety is a concern.
19905 Not to worry here.
19906 I've always seen an officer on premises during the main drop-the-kids-off / pick-the-kids-up window.
19907 This location still has a new feeling to it, and it is clean and cool.
19908 Nice cushy seats with cup holders, and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle.
19909 My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front.
19910 A place to perch my feet.
19911 -Swoop
19912 This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort.
19913 If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.
19914 The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.
19915 They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up.
19916 Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee.
19917 These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!!
19918 No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamar's has them beat!
19919 Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious!
19920 My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m's.
19921 Just thinking about them is making me salivate!
19922 ;-)!
19923 !
19924 I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties.
19925 This is definitely not your typical run of the mill nightclub.
19926 First off, let me mention that the decor is gothic cathedral style complete with erotic art, bright lights, and a chandelier over the bar.
19927 There is a unisex bathroom that is very clean and surprisingly never awkward.
19928 The music on Saturday nights for Doom Disco is an amaazing mix of old and new (think Joy Division and She Wants Revenge).
19929 Plus, the bartenders can make a mean gin and tonic and they have a pretty well stocked bar for any other drinks you might fancy.
19930 Tip: Doom Disco also has a Facebook page where they post pictures and the playlist from the Saturday before.
19931 Check it out!
19932 Overall, it's 100% worth the drive and $5 cover
19933 Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!
19934 A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.
19935 The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.
19936 The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.
19937 I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.
19938 The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!
19939 I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.
19940 Delicious nonetheless.
19941 The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!
19942 It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.)
19943 and it added to the soup quite nicely.
19944 Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?
19945 There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!
19946 The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were "Hungry Man" sized.
19947 Some side notes:
19948 1.
19949 Parking is awful for lunch.
19950 If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.
19951 2.
19952 I ordered a water with lemon.
19953 I received a water with no lemon.
19954 When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.
19955 I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.
19956 I couldn't come up with one.
19957 There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.
19958 Period.
19959 3.
19960 We walked in and staff #1 seated us.
19961 Staff #2 took our order.
19962 Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.
19963 Staff #4 brought our meal.
19964 Staff #5 cleared our plates.
19965 Staff #6 brought our check.
19966 Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.
19967 Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?
19968 I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of "who will show up next and what is their task?"
19969 It was still a little ridiculous.
19970 4.
19971 Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.
19972 I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.
19973 There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.
19974 No shortage there.
19975 It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.
19976 A big up for Taylor's.
19977 5.
19978 For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.
19979 It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.
19980 Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.
19981 I will definitely be back again.
19982 Enjoy!
19983 I went to Kens Nails on Tatum a couple weeks ago and finally found my go-to nail place!
19984 The staff was friendly and helpful and it's a nicely decorated spa.
19985 I went in to get a mani/pedi and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service.
19986 Mandy was my manicurist and she was wonderful.
19987 I got the gel nail manicure which was only $30 and the spa pedi which was only $32 and amazing!
19988 I am looking forward to going back.
19989 If I could give zero stars, I would.
19990 I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this.
19991 And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.
19992 When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.
19993 The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.
19994 Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, "Fags" as we walked by them.
19995 I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.
19996 When we entered the bar I noticed several "No firearms" signs plastered on the walls.
19997 I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.
19998 Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?
19999 That's how I felt.
20000 The decor of this bar was interesting.
20001 It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.
20002 The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.
20003 We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?
20004 Weird.
20005 I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.
20006 One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.
20007 Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.
20008 TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear.
20009 Having worked in the Scottsdale Airpark area going on 9 years or so, I've eaten lunch just about everywhere.
20010 There are plenty of good places, but not many ethnic places... Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic.
20011 I've only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet, and it is AMAZING!
20012 I keep thinking that I'm gonna be disappointed, eventually...
20013 But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap.
20014 I keep asking myself, how can it be so good?
20015 Is it cocaine?
20016 Cocaine in the food?!
20017 Is it?
20018 !
20019 They have different buffet items on different days, but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine.
20020 On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about... and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood!
20021 Be sure to save some room for the rice pudding, 'cause it's delicious.
20022 NOCA...  wow.
20023 Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.
20024 That liquid is then added to  the restaurant's soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.
20025 Limit 1 bowl per person...?
20026 NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.
20027 Honestly.
20028 This has probably been the best dining experience of my life.
20029 Everything was delicious on its own, all together, or when combining just a few of the items on the plate.
20030 Walked in and our server seated us.
20031 They brought us an amuse-bouche that had a small amount of blue cheese, chorizo, and chives.
20032 Was delicious.
20033 Then bread was served.
20034 After that, our Bacon and Egg was served.
20035 This was phenomenal.
20036 A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork belly....mmmm
20037 My fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck.
20038 Both were amazing.
20039 The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all.
20040 We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive.
20041 We had the donuts and the de-constructed cheesecake.
20042 I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake.
20043 All of this was amazing.
20044 My fiance wasn't in the mood for wine, so I delved into the beer list and low and behold, 90 minute IPA from dogfish head.... NOCA, I love you.
20045 ALTERNATIVE!
20046 !
20047 That's what this place is and in the land of BIG chains, this only could add some spice.
20048 We were welcomed here to the free screening of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil as part of a Yelp event.
20049 The personnel is totally committed to their project.
20050 If you are looking some retro movies or the gender I don't enjoy (but others do - horror), this is a good alternative.
20051 Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.
20052 The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.
20053 They work very well with children also.
20054 This place has it all.
20055 Fresh food.
20056 Vintage decor.
20057 Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days.
20058 Plenty of scooter parking.
20059 Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!).
20060 Oh and did I mention the food?
20061 My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.
20062 Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery.
20063 It's heaven in a bite.
20064 Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited.
20065 (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesn't know how to dance.)
20066 After reading about all the other Phoenix coffee establishments that had either come and gone, or were serving bad Costco coffee we were thrilled to find White Sage Espresso!
20067 The coffee was some of the best I've had in a long time!
20068 Our visit was such a pleasure on so many levels and we couldn't wait to go back the next day.
20069 First besides the fabulous coffee, we were amazed by the multidimensional flavors in the spinach cheese quiche, usually I'm not a big quiche fan but my husband is so we tried it and I think I could eat it all day long it was so good!
20070 Next, while we finished the quiche a batch of fresh blueberry muffins came out of the oven and the owner gave us a piece of one and again, amazing multidimensional flavors!
20071 We had one of our own and took one to our friends who raved about it also.
20072 After that as we chatted with Wes, the owner, we discovered that he and my husband had gone to the same high school in Southern California, another fun surprise to our visit to White Sage Espresso.
20073 And the last thing that really set White Sage apart from the average coffee shop is Wes is also a physic/medium.
20074 I had such a great feeling after chatting with Wes during our visit I decided to schedule an appointment with him.
20075 I have been to several other physics before but Wes brought something to my reading that I had never experienced before, I really enjoyed it, and I will definitely be in contact with Wes again in the future for another reading.
20076 I look forward our next visit to White Sage Espresso!
20077 I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast.
20078 The grilled bread pudding is amazing.
20079 And the bathrooms are so adorable!
20080 Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop.
20081 The staff is sooo horrible.
20082 I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks.
20083 P.S.
20084 I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul.
20085 My fiancé took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a no-more-studying-at-coffee-shops-during-dinner celebration!
20086 We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different.
20087 Our neighbor recommended Richardson's/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night.
20088 We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner.
20089 My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal.
20090 Hurrah!
20091 We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms.
20092 One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven.
20093 They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces.
20094 You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical.
20095 My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper.
20096 I'm not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth.
20097 Fantastic.
20098 I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite!
20099 What did it for me, however, was the dessert.
20100 We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries.
20101 The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy.
20102 Very memorable.
20103 We will be back, even if it's just for the truffles!
20104 I am so loyal to Durant's that I feel like a heel...but City Hall was divine.
20105 Steaks, sides, drinks...the only thing we didn't have was dessert...but $1100 later, who could afford it?
20106 Great fresh food and vegetarian options!
20107 I will definitely return!
20108 !
20109 Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.
20110 The Manger/operator guy.
20111 Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.
20112 Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.
20113 Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.
20114 Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.
20115 My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.
20116 Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.
20117 Nope.
20118 The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.
20119 This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.
20120 That is my problem with this joint.
20121 Elaboration will proceed now.
20122 This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.
20123 Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.
20124 What a douche bag.
20125 Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.
20126 Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?
20127 I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.
20128 I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?)
20129 I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.
20130 Lady taking my order after P.J.L.
20131 (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said "sorry"  Not her fault.
20132 Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.
20133 I don't blame you.
20134 Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.
20135 Awesome.
20136 We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.
20137 On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.
20138 SCORE!
20139 I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.
20140 No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.
20141 Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.
20142 P.J.L.
20143 butts in the middle of the order, says "This is your order, this is what you have" and was a fucking prick about it.
20144 Me, the customer.
20145 Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.
20146 Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?
20147 Fuck you.
20148 Seriously.
20149 The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says "ssssshhhhhh" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.
20150 Who degrades their employees like that?
20151 All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.
20152 Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.
20153 It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?
20154 Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.
20155 No one deserves that shit.
20156 I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.
20157 What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.
20158 My rant speaks for itself.
20159 One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.
20160 For the ones working there, I will pray for you.
20161 You need it.
20162 P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.
20163 You would do great at that.
20164 Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet.
20165 We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up.
20166 Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour.
20167 They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card.
20168 The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated.
20169 At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes.
20170 So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines.
20171 What a fucking joke.
20172 Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.
20173 Never, EVER again.
20174 Angry Bro Bar !
20175 Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it.
20176 The bar is lame.
20177 Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didn't try and fight each other.
20178 Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.
20179 They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.
20180 My car is still shining a week later!
20181 The wait is very minimal.
20182 The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.
20183 Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!
20184 Definitely worth the money!
20185 I could spend hours in this place.
20186 In fact, I know I have.
20187 There are so many things to look at and it's way more than just books.
20188 They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets.
20189 If you're into used books, this is the place to go.
20190 I've found nearly mint condition vintage books here and they've made the perfect gifts.
20191 The people who work here are great as well.
20192 They're more than willing to help and offer good recommendations.
20193 This is a go to if you're looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore.
20194 Food is great.
20195 Really good deal, lots of tasty food for a great price.
20196 My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac & Cheese & Coleslaw & Kool Aid.
20197 Founded by former NFL & ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out.
20198 The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee,
20199 Yay!!
20200 This place is fantastic.
20201 Great pastries and atmosphere.
20202 I can't wait to go back.
20203 Gross, repulsive, appauling, disgusting, overrated, dirty, should be shut down by the CDC.
20204 You get the jist?
20205 The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired.
20206 Sound harsh?
20207 Not at all.
20208 Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed.
20209 We pull up in the car.
20210 It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu, see if there's seating etc).
20211 Normal behavior.
20212 So my friend K, approaches the guy at the door and asks "what type of food is served here?"
20213 expecting a simple response like  "American" or "here let me grab you a menu."
20214 Ready for this...?
20215 ?
20216 His response: "human food"
20217 HUMAN FOOD?!?!?
20218 !
20219 HUMAN FOOD!??!?
20220 !
20221 K is just an average potential customer, asking a fair easy to answer question.
20222 Okaaaaay.
20223 Being the sweetheart K is, she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating.
20224 He sarcastically, mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby.
20225 How was this guy ever hired?
20226 Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been "yea, the patio seems like it has some space tonight, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU" or "at this fine establishment it's seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly."
20227 Sunday night's fine joke machine at the front door: I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron.
20228 Everyone and their mom has had some turn at being a waiter/hostess/manager/bartender etc etc in the food and hospitality industry, be it in AZ, SF, WHEREVER and KNOWS the #1 101 rule is:
20229 BE KIND TO THE GUEST
20230 (kiss@$$ , the customer is always right etc.)
20231 Add to that list: answer straightforward questions from your guests with flat out, non-acrimonious answers!
20232 Granted this review can say nothing about this establishement beyond the front door because we never made it that far.
20233 My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time.
20234 We had a groupon.
20235 The place was packed.
20236 Different football games going on tvs all over the place.
20237 I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside.
20238 So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol.
20239    We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple.
20240 We said sure.
20241 There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us.
20242 It was same as if we had our own table.
20243 Worked out great:)
20244  We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!!
20245 Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill.
20246 We Loved them!
20247 I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all.
20248 They were huge!
20249 We each ended up taking half home.
20250 Not just huge but tasty.
20251 I loved mine.
20252 We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)
20253 Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!
20254 I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.
20255 Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.
20256 Then came Qdoba.
20257 This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).
20258 I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.
20259 The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that "punched in the stomach" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).
20260 I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).
20261 This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often!
20262 P.S.
20263 If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!
20264 (ku-doh-ba???)
20265 My review is only for the purchase of a non-disposable diaper at this swim school.
20266 As soon as I entered, I was promptly greeted and asked how they could help me.
20267 I explained that I was looking for a non-disposable diaper for my lil'un and they asked about weight etc and found the perfect one for her.
20268 The lady explained to me that the non-disposable diapers are so good that even if for some reason there is an accidental Code Brown, if you know what I mean, they will not charge their patrons.
20269 They really believe in the product that they sell.
20270 Their swimming pool looks nice and clean and this could really be a fun place for little kids.
20271 I know they do parent and child classes here also.
20272 Good works
20273 A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain.
20274 We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love.
20275 There are plenty of TV's for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.
20276 I went here while on vacation visiting my friend.
20277 Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try.
20278 The staff was totally rude.
20279 Before we went, we called to check the hours.
20280 The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information.
20281 The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special.
20282 If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service.
20283 Double fail.
20284 Always love it!!
20285 so good and good price
20286 This review is for the bar only.
20287 I had a date last week and was looking for a local bar to grab drinks at.
20288 I called Cycle on Wednesday and was told they would be open until at least midnight on Friday, and the guy was very nice.
20289 Friday arrives, and I take my date there, and when we enter the bar, the bartender makes a gas face and says they are closed for the night.
20290 I told her that I called just two days earlier and she just stared at me.
20291 No attempt at fixing anything, nada.
20292 One drunken patron at the bar yelled to open the bar back up, but I was over it.
20293 Well done cycle.
20294 This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is.
20295 I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.
20296 Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere.
20297 Try:
20298 - Mushroom Party Pizza
20299 - Roasted Corn Pizza
20300 - Baked Wings
20301 - Red Velvet Cake
20302 Only con is the parking is kinda crazy.
20303 Okay... just let me say, these guys are the best!
20304 My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for 5 weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night.
20305 No kidding.
20306 And, yes, my butt thanks me not for such goings on.
20307 But at any rate, we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff.
20308 I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream -- I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in, then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge.
20309 This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys!
20310 And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure.
20311 Viola!
20312 No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on.
20313 They really are the best!
20314 I can't wait to visit them again!
20315 :)
20316 I'm giving this Urban a perfect rating, for it never fails that when I walk through its doors, I always find something I want (or could) buy - even if it's a gift for somebody else, like my younger sister or best bud in Detroit.
20317 I even found one of my favorite sweaters here on clearance for $20.
20318 I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe, so if I had my choice, I'd come here to browse and buy.
20319 Plus, it's within walking distance of Scottsdale Fashion Park, Borders and Olive & Ivy (the perfect spot for brunch/lunch).
20320 This place is a freaking joke.
20321 Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait.
20322 They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying.
20323 There's not even room for a stroller.
20324 Horrible, horrible experience!
20325 Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try.
20326 My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long.
20327 Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I don't like.
20328 But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly.
20329 I ordered the pork chop, eggs, and hash browns.
20330 The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good.
20331 I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix.
20332 Make sure to try the bacon too.
20333 I love the clothes and accessories, the staff is friendly and the prices accomodate everyone!
20334 Huge line for incompetent employees who don't even know how to wash cars.
20335 I`ve had work done by this shop a few times thruoghout the past few years.
20336 My latest experience was when my sons car broke its timing belt and needed substantial repairs.
20337 Bob informed us that he could move the car out of the way in his lot to be safely stored until we decided whether we wanted to fix it or not.
20338 This is just one of the reasons why I`ll always bring my business to him.
20339 This place has been here 7 years and we have never been.
20340 Are you kidding me?
20341 The food is excellent.
20342 The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important.
20343 I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich.
20344 YUMMY!!!
20345 There are many choices for salad toppings.
20346 There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad.
20347 I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette.
20348 I really think this was the best salad I have ever had!
20349 They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing.
20350 I chose the chicken pesto sandwich.
20351 The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl.
20352 The sandwich was excellent.
20353 My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich.
20354 This is one huge sandwich!
20355 It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!!
20356 Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork.
20357 We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again.
20358 Loved it!!!
20359 !
20360 In being a bit of a burrito man, I was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat.
20361 However, all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate, as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork, turkey, guacamole, and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich.
20362 The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion, amazing meat, and super flavorful.
20363 I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place.
20364 People were friendly toward us in any case.
20365 Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas...
20366 Fair and honest prices.
20367 Friends and I have been ripped off by other companies for the last several years wondering if there was anyone honest left.
20368 During the summer, you're at the mercy of the air conditioning techs and usually they take advantage of it.
20369 I'm very happy with their service.
20370 Very prompt and professional.
20371 Father and son make a great team.
20372 Great warranty service.
20373 An electronic part he installed died after 3 weeks.
20374 He came out immediately and replaced the item for no charge.
20375 So yummy!
20376 Strange combination but great place
20377 I absoloutely love this place.
20378 Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.
20379 Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.
20380 Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.
20381 I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.
20382 Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop...
20383 I'm a bit of a snob, I admit it.
20384 I generally prefer the full-service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg.
20385 But times are tight - and I want my nails and my money.
20386 Enter Biagio.
20387 When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa.
20388 But when you read the prices, you wonder how they can stay in business.
20389 A "spa" pedicure, one of the most expensive treatments, is a whopping $49 (I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm).
20390 Not only do you get a great pedicure (best I've EVER received), but you get a leg and neck massage (yes the chairs are massage chairs, but real hands give you a real massage).
20391 A "spa" manicure, which also comes with a neck massage, is $25.
20392 The technicians are very nice, the store is immaculate, the tools are all sterilized, and the treatments are very high quality (even for a snob like me).
20393 Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa, not a strip-mall dive nail salon.
20394 I highly recommend Biagio.
20395 I have been there several times, and plan to go back often.
20396 I actually love this place and I always get great service when I'm there.
20397 The tootsie roll is by far my favorite.
20398 I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?
20399 Best cupcakes ever.
20400 I can't get enough of the Strawberry and Red Velvet.
20401 They even have a gluten free Red Velvet!
20402 Order several to take home.
20403 They will give you a zip-loc bag that keeps them fresh and moist for days!
20404 I'm addicted.
20405 Not cheap, about $22 for 6 but when you taste them, who cares....
20406 Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.
20407 The Mozarella, Tomato, Basil is perfect.
20408 The focaccia bread is perfectly crunchy and slightly salted to the consummate texture.
20409 I wish I still worked closer...
20410 Really as bad as it gets.
20411 Crap food.
20412 Over priced.
20413 Ugly, tasteless interior
20414 Bad music and music system
20415 Tired staff
20416 This place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close.
20417 I would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's, and I have never been to an Applebee's.
20418 Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition.
20419 Then again, there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going.
20420 These are some great cheesesteaks.
20421 I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy.
20422 The staff are nice and the food is delicious.
20423 Also try the 'Cheesesteak Fries' they are freakin amazing!
20424 I am glad I work next to this place, always a great lunch.
20425 I work next door, and I love her !
20426 She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts !
20427 !
20428 Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey, given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin !
20429 My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off... oh well getting back to my review.
20430 I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job, each time.
20431 She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in.
20432 Its never too tight and never too lose, and she always always delivers on time.
20433 I have been here atleast 10 times !!
20434 Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service!
20435 !
20436 Excellent food!
20437 I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations.
20438 Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad!
20439 Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad!
20440 Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor.
20441 Jodi is fantastic!
20442 Extraordinary!
20443 After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.
20444 Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.
20445 During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.
20446 I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.
20447 She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.
20448 I'm ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.
20449 What more can a girl ask?
20450 Thanks so much, Jodi.
20451 This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall.
20452 No screaming kids in your way.
20453 The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price.
20454 I get my husband's work shirts here for like $8.
20455 Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants.
20456 YESSSSS!
20457 I -3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross.
20458 I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown.
20459 They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine.
20460 Where else can you find something like that?
20461 I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies.
20462 Worth the $5 each.
20463 My bathroom is gorgeous.
20464 You'll want to take a crap in there.
20465 The Menu here is great.
20466 So much to choose from and its always good.
20467 No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.
20468 The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.
20469 I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit
20470 great beer selection
20471 great live music
20472 great atmosphere
20473 I used to live across the street and nightcap it here everynight.
20474 there is always something to be had at rosie's.
20475 I LOVE this place.
20476 I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for 5 years and I finally got it today since I'm back for a business trip!
20477 I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious.
20478 Their prices are great too!
20479 Very polite staff.
20480 Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!
20481 !
20482 This is my favorite place locally here in Phoenix, absolutely great coffee!
20483 Next to central highschool and light rail so there can be traffic when school let's out or rush hour.
20484 Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley.
20485 I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley.
20486 Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience.
20487 WOW!
20488 Love Love Love it.
20489 The Frozen Yogurt is only 8 calories per ounce.
20490 You can get your yogurt fix and still be healthy.
20491 Also they run specials if you sign up for the deals.
20492 Then they have a punch card program as well.
20493 My husband loves going there because he can still get regular Thrifty Ice Cream.
20494 I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly.
20495 It has many dining, shopping, and entertainment options.
20496 It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit.
20497 It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tilly's, American Eagle, and Victoria's Secret, but also freestanding stores such as Target, Best Buy, and Ulta.
20498 There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkin's Movie Theater as well.
20499 It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life!
20500 Ok, I hesitated writing a review of this place because I like that it's not busy, but I want the place to survive because I enjoy it so much.
20501 I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them.
20502 From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine.
20503 This gym is everything but.
20504 I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend.
20505 We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool.
20506 As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy.
20507 Awesome attitude.
20508 The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work.
20509 I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).
20510 No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them.
20511 No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps.
20512 Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).
20513 Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available.
20514 (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)
20515 Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body.
20516 Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now.
20517 Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.
20518 (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady.
20519 You turned a moment of shame into motivation.
20520 Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)
20521 The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development.
20522 Central and....Encanto (?)
20523 You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage.
20524 The gym validates.
20525 There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.)
20526 Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it.
20527 I saw no young kids running around.
20528 The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy.
20529 No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.
20530 But hey, to each his own.
20531 I started working with Second Chance FitCenter in the spring of this year.
20532 I went because I wanted to feel stronger, especially in my core.
20533 I run and am a generally active dude, but wanted something more out of my physical body.
20534 I had never done any type of "personal training" so I was a little apprehensive....and...
20535 I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat - she is a great teacher, which if personal training is anything it is a psychologist/mentor/butt kicker/saint...so in my book that is a great teacher!
20536 !
20537 Case in point:
20538 A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving - mostly just my own mind being negative.
20539 So Heat said, "Next time we will try the very first workout we did.
20540 Cool?"
20541 I was game.
20542 Dude!
20543 I blew through that sucker - to the point were I was like "this is cake"...of course on the second and third time through the sets  (and I think fourth on this day...) it got harder and harder...and I totally kept up.
20544 It was awesome.
20545 I loved it.
20546 My Checklist:
20547 Sense of accomplishment (check)
20548 Strength building (check)
20549 Piece of mind, knowing I am taking care of myself (check)
20550 Good teaching and patience (check)
20551 In short, I love my time at Second Chance.
20552 I need to stop going here so much, but it's hard to stay away.
20553 Great fresh sandwiches!!
20554 The pastrami and caprese are absolute perfection!!
20555 The orzo pasta salad is spot on for the summer.
20556 Definitely a must id in mesa..they need more central location for sure!
20557 Excuse me.
20558 How in the world have I lived walking distance from Cornish Pasty Company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem?!
20559 Thats what I want to know.
20560 A friend introduced us to Cornish Pasty saying it is "the best restaurant ever".
20561 I best give it a try then right?
20562 The Tempe location is smaller than the Mesa location but I LOVE its vibe.
20563 A small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables, dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part, pretty good music.
20564 My man and I ordered the Mexican Pasty and the Rosemary Chicken Pasty.
20565 They were unbelievable!
20566 SO GOOD.
20567 The Mexican Pasty was definitely the better of the two but I'd order both of them again any day.
20568 A little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy.
20569 I respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options.
20570 What generation are you living in if you don't offer veggie options these days?
20571 Get with the program all you other restaurants.
20572 You know who you are!
20573 I loved the entire experience and can't wait for our next trip.
20574 Love Bagel Nosh!
20575 The staff is so friendly and of course the food is delicious!
20576 I have to admit that the pumpkin latte was no Starbucks pumpkin latte, but the pumpkin cream cheese was amazing!
20577 ( I do realize it's no longer pumpkin season, I was just wishing I had some anyway) It can get busy on the weekend mornings, esp since the bike shop opened up next door, but I find it well worth the wait!
20578 (Oh, and fyi it closes at 2:30 - so get your coffee early!)
20579 We live in Chandler, so we get take out here probably once a month.
20580 My husband is from the east coast and in both his and my opinion, these are the best cheesesteaks around!
20581 We love their spicy peppers (they are hot!)
20582 and while I am not really a cheesesteak fan, their chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are fabulous!
20583 The owners are hard working and really appreciate all of their customers and let you know it!
20584 We have been eating here for three years now and have never had a bad experience.
20585 Impressive!
20586 I dined at House of Tricks last week based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.
20587 The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal.
20588 I had trouble deciding what to eat, so I ordered 3 appetizers:   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Veal 2 ways, and Braized Oxtail.
20589 The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest.
20590 The "Veal 2 Ways" and "Braised Oxtail" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.
20591 I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.
20592 I can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.
20593 I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.
20594 Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy.
20595 Wow, that is some great BBQ.
20596 Probably the best I have had in Arizona.
20597 The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.
20598 I will be there again and again!
20599 20% off with a Yelp check in?
20600 SCORE!
20601 They have very unique, colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale.
20602 But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry!
20603 There's a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches.
20604 I snatched up two really cute vintage rings.
20605 They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes.
20606 Very good!!!
20607 I've been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time.
20608 Very authentic Korean food.
20609 This is my favorite spot now!
20610 !
20611 The dishes I had so far:
20612 Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang.
20613 All were very good.
20614 I can't wait to go back and try other food!
20615 Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days.
20616 I love their turkey and provolone cold sub!
20617 Delicious with pickles added.
20618 Really good, healthy food.
20619 Owner is super friendly.
20620 Would definitely recommend.
20621 :)
20622 I'm giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had.
20623 My family came here for my brother's birthday a few weeks back, and two of our four dishes came out undercooked.
20624 We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.
20625 They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.
20626 We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.
20627 However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.
20628 We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.
20629 Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.
20630 They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant.
20631 Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile, but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it!
20632 I will gladly return here as a result.
20633 I cannot believe all these negative reviews.
20634 First I'd like to start with the prices.
20635 Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite.
20636 AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees.
20637 And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs.
20638 And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more.
20639 To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80's when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit.
20640 If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done.
20641 The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine.
20642 I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA.
20643 But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing.
20644 The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced.
20645 As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me.
20646 I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA.
20647 This store - I have never had a bad experience.
20648 Always a good one.
20649 i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains.
20650 Mylissa has given my daughter and me the *best* cuts!
20651 If you can, see her.
20652 She will take great care of you!
20653 So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis.
20654 Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay!
20655 A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.
20656 I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...
20657 There I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use "Talent" or "Creativity") and in a pretty bad ass studio.
20658 The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas.
20659 One being a cure for cancer!
20660 Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.
20661 The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable.
20662 Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller!
20663 He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.
20664 It was sexy.
20665 Thanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS!
20666 You rock, alternatively!
20667 Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way.
20668 I was drooling with the flavors!
20669 Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style).
20670 I'm not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list!
20671 Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!
20672 We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center.
20673 Fantastic place!
20674 Unbelievable beer selection, great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience.
20675 Will definitely be back again soon!
20676 The kids love panda express.
20677 My 9 year old actually complains that they give you too much food.
20678 This is pretty much the only non chicken nugget or spaghetti or pizza food that my 5 year old will eat.
20679 And to be honest- I don't mind it either.
20680 Oooohhhh baby I loooove your way...everyday...yeeeaaaahhh.
20681 I wanna be with you night and day....
20682 Went back to the swizzle last night and fell in love again.
20683 With pool.
20684 With dives.
20685 With football.
20686 With beer.
20687 With diversity.
20688 With the random atrium.
20689 With the jukebox.
20690 With life.
20691 How can you beat pool and beer, combined with an awesome location, a diverse crowd, and a room full of people screaming at the TV because football is on?
20692 Then top that with the weird quirkiness that makes me warm and fuzzy on the inside...the atrium, a lovely bathroom and random bumper stickers at the bar.
20693 The End.
20694 Fantastic find for delicious, healthy food and good service!
20695 !
20696 A local friend said that they'd heard good things but hadn't been yet.
20697 They asked us to check it out., so we went for a late lunch mid-week and it was still jam packed (30 minute wait) at 1:30 p.m.. We sat at the bar and received terrific service.
20698 The fish tacos, steak tacos, bison burger and desserts were all delicious.
20699 It is an open-air style restaurant where you can see into the kitchen.
20700 All ingredients are super fresh and the culinary quality is extremely high given that they can make even the healthiest things taste wonderful.
20701 I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy food alternative.
20702 This review is based on an event I attended here.
20703 I did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar.
20704 I was a guest at the Etiquette Dinner put on by ASU and affiliates.
20705 From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt welcomed.
20706 Each employee I passed greeted me with a smile and professionality.
20707 I thought the hotel interior was really cool also.
20708 When I was leaving the event, I thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities.
20709 I should try it!
20710 Bad ass, just like the name.
20711 I've heard that this facility doesn't have any water restrictions so their course is lush & in tip top shape.
20712 It's definitely a challenging course.
20713 The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  $35 for residents!
20714 You have to check it out, it's a great deal.
20715 Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!!
20716 Boyfriend and I were both very impressed.
20717 We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant.
20718 Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices.
20719 Cheese trio platter was sooooo good.
20720 I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share.
20721 I had the beet salad which was very good.
20722 Love the candied walnuts in it.
20723 Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender, juicy and delicious!
20724 The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh.
20725 Even the coffee was good.
20726 It's very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think we've found it.
20727 Service was fantastic!
20728 Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered.
20729 Could it be possible I can't find anything to criticize?!
20730 I can't.
20731 Love this place.
20732 Wow!
20733 I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals.
20734 Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip.
20735 As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home.
20736 Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.
20737 Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.
20738 Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.
20739 Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.
20740 Simple, fresh, delicious...
20741 Just remember to bring cash
20742 If I was on death row and had to choose a meal for my "last supper" I would include the New Mexico Skillet (hold the chorizo) from Butters.
20743 I have searched high and low for any other breakfast place that compares to Butters and I cannot find anything.
20744 I thought that I had found a close contender in Perk Eatery in North Scottsdale but a second visit proved that they were not consistent.
20745 Butters is consistently amazing.
20746 The service is strangely fast but you'd have to be crazy to complain about that.
20747 Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food.
20748 I always want to try the crepes or french toast but I just can't bring myself to get anything other than the New Mexico skillet.
20749 Maybe one day I'll branch out.
20750 Beer heaven!
20751 What don't they have?
20752 The staff has a taste for heavy body beer so if that isn't your ONLY criteria for great beer.
20753 I would just go with your gut.
20754 Their staff does know their stuff.
20755 Great ambiance (though a tad noisy), food, service and views.
20756 For our meals, we got the following:
20757 [Amuse bouche]
20758 I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp.
20759 Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks.
20760 [Appetizer]
20761 Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning.
20762 Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me.
20763 Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor.
20764 [Entree]
20765 Halibut - Best dish in recent memory!
20766 Get this.
20767 Just do it.
20768 Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef.
20769 The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy.
20770 [Dessert]
20771 Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious.
20772 The rest of it was okay.
20773 After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view.
20774 We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster.
20775 Oh well!
20776 The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert.
20777 Two thumbs up!
20778 Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside.
20779 Woohoo!
20780 Lots of cool, cute and educational things here for my two kiddies.
20781 I stop in here for each birthday/Christmas to balance out the "junk" toys.
20782 I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books.
20783 :)
20784 Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon.
20785 The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus.
20786 Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.
20787 Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish!
20788 Had to update this review and rating because of it :D
20789 I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN'T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER!
20790 the vibe is young clean and fresh.
20791 the good is so delish..
20792 I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch (:
20793 One of my favorites.
20794 The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling.
20795 The prices are reasonable for what you get.
20796 Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or "no Tip" casual meal.
20797 Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific.
20798 Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family.
20799 You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit.
20800 Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson.
20801 We even have birthday parties here!
20802 The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.
20803 Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father.
20804 Thanks to Hubbard.
20805 I wish they had a "0" star option too!
20806 The service and food was awful.
20807 Just a bunch of kids running the place.
20808 The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.
20809 The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other.
20810 The manager was too busy flirting with the other help.
20811 We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress.
20812 We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening.
20813 What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place?
20814 NEVER GOING BACK!!!
20815 !
20816 This is not an Asian Topless Bar.
20817 It is an Asian "Tapas" bar.
20818 The guys I was traveling with spent the first ten minutes waiting for the show to start and were disappointed when I smacked them all for actually thinking I would take my coworkers to a topless bar.
20819 "Tapas" are little appetizer plates, and Sens is all about getting a little taste of everything.
20820 The atmosphere is fantastic - eclectic, moody and very, very cozy (so I recommend reservations).
20821 The little dishes are about four single servings, so you'll want to order several plates!
20822 Highly recommend the volcano flamed beef and the sugar cane pork.
20823 The food is very flavorful -- but everything is a bit spicy (garlicky-spicy), even the dishes they call "mild."
20824 Plates run about $6-$9 each, and each person in our party ordered 3 or 4 plates...we were all full by the time we left!
20825 Definitely get a cocktail, their mixed drink menu is fab (White Sin is absolutely sinful...and absolutely worth the indulgence).
20826 Good service but the food was horrific.
20827 The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.
20828 Could not eat the tamale it was so bad.
20829 Will not go back.
20830 I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach.
20831 By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley.
20832 The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look.
20833 Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch.
20834 I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart.
20835 It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up.
20836 If you havent been there-MUST GO.
20837 Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because I've stayed at just about every other resort in town that I've really wanted to check out.
20838 Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home.
20839 No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay.
20840 Score.
20841 We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.
20842 It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite).
20843 Life was grand.
20844 Until the morning.
20845 *bang bang*  WTF is that noise?
20846 *bang bang*  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn't happening on the bed.
20847 Are they really doing construction at 8:15am?
20848 It continued.
20849 My girlfriend called down to the front desk.
20850 The noise stopped.
20851 Then it continued.
20852 *bang bang*  We were about to lose it.
20853 They called our room, "do you mind if they continue working?".
20854 Actually, we had just fallen back asleep...
20855 So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests.
20856 No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal.
20857 A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn't even necessary.
20858 Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no?
20859 I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable.
20860 They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room.
20861 Nice place, the presidential villa.
20862 It's actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet,  you know...typical amenities.
20863 I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!)
20864 , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks.
20865 Naturally, if they hadn't done enough, they comped dinner as well.
20866 We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that.
20867 But they more than made up for it.
20868 They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately.
20869 I can't ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service.
20870 I would not hesitate to stay here again.
20871 note: the 5 stars i'm giving this place is for their happy hour menu, not the regular menu.
20872 if you order off the regular menu no amount of advice can help you.
20873 M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino.
20874 $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, such as 1/2 lb.
20875 burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc.
20876 don't order the fish chilli though, it tastes like A1 sauce.
20877 they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc.
20878 happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius.
20879 make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget.
20880 BUZZKILL.
20881 I love this place.
20882 You might ask "why does the free roving large land mammal love a place that makes him sweat so hard that he's puked, twice?"
20883 And here's why: if you can get me to yack during a workout from pushing me hard and coming up with exercises I've not done before (which is hard with 4 years in the Army, 17 years of Rugby, and 30 years of riding a bike) then you're doing something RIGHT!
20884 My special lady friend got me into the idea of this as a good way to dog stomp one another via a proxy named Jeff.
20885 Jeff is our trainer, and if you'll pardon my digression, allow me to share with you about Jeff.
20886 We have this song in Rugby called "The S&M Man."
20887 Its a less than politically correct song about a special person, usually someone who trains us or who is a hell of a rugger him/herself, who is so sick, so wrong, that he makes pain fun and delightful.
20888 And I use the word "pain" in the best way.
20889 Pain, after all, is just weakness, and in my case old pizzas, leaving the body.
20890 Jeff is amazing.
20891 He gets it done in 30 minutes to the point where I don't really want to do anything the next day.
20892 Its in and out, slam, bam, thank you ma'am with Jeff and Vitality.
20893 This is going to be a part of my training for the long term.
20894 I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.
20895 I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.
20896 Management handled this issue horribly.
20897 Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.
20898 You are treated only as a number.
20899 Do yourself a favor and stay away.
20900 I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.
20901 OMG!
20902 I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life.
20903 First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe.
20904 I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store.
20905 The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe.
20906 I asked again those models have maps of Europe?
20907 "Yes and Australia too".
20908 And you have those models in stock?
20909 "Yes."
20910 What is the price range?
20911 "$100 to $300".
20912 Thank you.
20913 FIRST MISINFORMATION!
20914 So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with "GPS Specialist" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!!
20915 He said the call center "is a bunch of retards" and that those were all last years models.
20916 Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units.
20917 When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them!
20918 (okay not confident in your product knowledge).
20919 Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps.
20920 SECOND MISINFORMATION.
20921 I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps!
20922 I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.
20923 So I drive back to Fry's.
20924 Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS.
20925 I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great).
20926 He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps.
20927 So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.
20928 THIRD MISINFORMATION.
20929 Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper.
20930 I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!
20931 !
20932 Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book.
20933 Awesome.
20934 Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!
20935 Great food!!!
20936 The French dip is to die for!!
20937 Great Service!
20938 Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!
20939 Def a hidden gem!
20940 My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
20941 Amazing!
20942 The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works!
20943 WOW!
20944 I have never been to a place with service this horrible.
20945 I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!
20946 I came in with a group of 4.
20947 We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.
20948 That was a mistake..
20949 As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.
20950 There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.
20951 We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.
20952 After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!
20953 It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.
20954 What a joke...
20955 **EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.
20956 I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.
20957 I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something
20958 YUMMMMMM!!!!
20959 I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it!
20960 Very clean and unique casual setting.
20961 Staff were very friendly, food was hot, fresh and amazingly gooy...definately a 4+ napkin kind of meal.
20962 So happy to see they serve Chicken philly -steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries!
20963 Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeee-licous food.
20964 This place is a must try!
20965 I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:
20966 THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open.
20967 If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted.
20968 I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed.
20969 Vitamin T will fail, there I said it.
20970 I am obsessed with this place!
20971 I cannot say enough amazing things...I love their exhibits...I love Arcadia Farms inside...I love the architecture and design of the building...I love the staff (they are so helpful)...the gift shop is fabulous (I got the cutest watch bangle)...I love the giant red t-rex out front...I love the kids area (or at least my son does)...I love the diversity of the art!
20972 I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family!
20973 You can have weddings here and they are beautiful!
20974 They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a member...at least just go once and you will fall in love!
20975 I'm not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever.
20976 A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly.
20977 SawTh[sic] Sense Christmas show for the second time last weekend.
20978 Great show - laughed my ass off.
20979 Thinking about going back for closing weekend...  :)
20980 The greatest community that I've ever been a part of!
20981 Gilbert Crossfit isn't just a place where you can get in the best shape of your life... it is a community of friends that share the same outlook on life, support eachother in everything they do and truly care about one another.
20982 Getting in shape and doing things you never thought possible is just the added benefit of being part of this group.
20983 If you are looking to get in shape, live a long healthy life, and have fun with a great group of people... come by Gilbert Crossfit.. You'll never go back to a Globo Gym again!
20984 Thank goodness for Sue at Mill Avenue Travel.
20985 We contacted Sue to book our honeymoon trip to St. Lucia at one of the Sandals resort.
20986 She was great with setting everything up, booking airfare etc.
20987 When our original airfare decided to cancel the flight, she made sure we had a comparable one booked.
20988 The best thing she did for us was encourage us to purchase travel insurance.
20989 When we arrived at our Miami hotel at 10:30pm the night prior to leaving for St. Lucia, we had discovered Sue had left us an urgent note to contact her.
20990 We found out a hurricane had hit St. Lucia and all of a sudden our honeymoon plans starting crumbling apart.
20991 Because of Sue and our travel insurance (thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one!
20992 ), we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didn't miss a beat.
20993 Sue was in constant contact with us, which calmed the craziness I was feeling (and I'm sure my new husband was relieved).
20994 The airlines even took care of our baggage fees on the way to the Bahamas.
20995 If we had booked this trip on our own, we would have been up a creek without a paddle.
20996 I most definitely would not have purchased travel insurance and our honeymoon would not have turned out to be the amazing trip it was.
20997 We will definitely be using Sue again.
20998 All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!
20999 We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good.
21000 Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.
21001 For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!
21002 Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.
21003 Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.
21004 For dessert we indulged on the "Best Of Phoenix" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan....
21005 OMG!!!!
21006 And the coffee was yummy too!
21007 We also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!
21008 As the sign over the door says... "Cha Cha Cha!"
21009 There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pm
21010 The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors
21011 I live behind this location but I may not return.
21012 There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street...
21013 I am writing this review only for the optical department.
21014 I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis.
21015 The receptionist asked me if I could come back in 5 hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me.
21016 She asked her and she said no she did not have time.
21017 I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years.
21018 I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not.
21019 Dont ever waste your time going here if you need immediate attention for an emergency because they will not make room for you.
21020 Oh boy..
21021 I usually LOVE LOVE Mucho Gusto.. but NO ME GUSTA today!
21022 We got a to go order, perhaps that was mistake numero uno.
21023 I got the nachos.. really, you can't mess those up... Or so I thouhgt!
21024 I mean Filiberto's would have been a better choice!
21025 Can you say cold soggy mess.. maybe that was my fault.
21026 I will accept the blame.
21027 I really should have known better.
21028 Mistake numero dos... What do you call Shrimp Cocktail with out the shrimp??
21029 Bad Service!
21030 Lack of quality control....Really.. Really?
21031 You forgot the shimp?
21032 How do you do that....
21033 Better question WHO DOES THAT?
21034 Mistake numero tres...lemme just say burned tasting chips (as opposed to my soggy nacho chips) and left an acrid taste in ones mouth and the most offending guacamole that I have ever had.
21035 Let me just say that my co worker and I eat here frequently enough that we can order for each other.
21036 We also know to order our guacamole with out the Grand Marnier galze thingy on top.
21037 Mucho Gusto you mucho FAILED me today.
21038 I hate leaving a bad review without first compaining to management so expect a phone call from me shortly.
21039 Big fan of this store - the owner tries very hard to create an inviting atmosphere for all levels of gamers.
21040 Further, the store provides for a host of niches, including euro-games, Ameritrash, role playing, and miniature wargaming.
21041 Good amount of supplies (both GW and P3, among others).
21042 Lots of tables for miniature gaming, board games, CCGs, and painting in the back (and a fridge with soda).
21043 They've started carrying MTG over the last few months, and that collection has grown.
21044 Always something going on here, but nothing intimidating.
21045 The owner is very, very helpful: willing to answer questions about painting, games, and to make special orders (even trips over to Gilbert at Battlefoam when necessary).
21046 Yep, big fan.
21047 Kids love Disney, and so do I.
21048 One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.
21049 Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids.
21050 This is one of the top three Dog Parks in the Valley.
21051 Plenty of room, well lit in the evenings, plenty of water.
21052 I've seen the attendance shift slightly in the last year with less hipsters and more kooks coming in.
21053 Not a problem though because there are always multiple groups to mingle with.
21054 For photos and a complete review of this park go to www.dogparkriot.com.
21055 Ok, I'll say this up front, I don't like chains.
21056 There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain.
21057 That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.
21058 Yes, it "seems" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.
21059 So much awesome unlimited red meat.
21060 Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!
21061 It's killer but don't fill up!
21062 And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed.
21063 hahahahaha.
21064 Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world.
21065 I love this place.
21066 It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands.
21067 I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business.
21068 The room was clean and the beds so comfortable.
21069 The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time.
21070 I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient.
21071 Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too.
21072 Great experience!
21073 love love love it!
21074 What a quaint little piece of heaven.
21075 Located south phoenix...I wasn't sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city.
21076 We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast.
21077 The food was wonderful and the presentation was great!
21078 I highly recommend it.
21079 It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower!
21080 !
21081 Wow!
21082 Food was great!
21083 But the service was even better!!!
21084 We got there early so we didn't have to wait a long time.
21085 Their computer system was down, so instead of asking for cash or taking our card numbers, they comped out lunch.
21086 So impressed with this place!
21087 And such a cool vibe!
21088 Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback.
21089 For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore.
21090 The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken).
21091 I must say, they are even more delicious!
21092 Is it your cheapest lunch option?
21093 Probably not.
21094 I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food.
21095 So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs.
21096 I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too.
21097 Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!
21098 Ok, so I know that this private shooting club has had it's share of problems with membership and maintenance issues but I have to say, in the last 6 months, under the direction of a semi-new board of directors, the range facilities have been greatly improved.
21099 The members can enjoy shooting pistols or rifles pretty much all day every day uninterupted except when a scheduled match is on the club calendar located at www.phoenixrodandgun.
21100 This new fully updated calendar is really cutting down on the number of scheduling conflicts between match directors and members.
21101 Also, since aquiring new Range Staff, the number of complaints about other members or range employees has gone way down.
21102 I do have to say, the range which is located right in central phoenix is affordable, practical and overall a great shooting experience.
21103 Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10.
21104 (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.)
21105 The food came very quickly.
21106 We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad.
21107 Dessert was great.
21108 The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldn't taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée).
21109 One of the best meals we had in Arizona.
21110 And we also really liked the decor.
21111 Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative.
21112 Not sure why anyone would ding them for that.
21113 Also, the portion sizes were just fine.
21114 We all left full but not feeling gross.
21115 We're from MA, and were unaware of the chef's celebrity.
21116 I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype?
21117 I'm outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension.
21118 Just thorough competence.
21119 Note: It's a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel.
21120 Under 2 miles.
21121 Polite friendly staff.
21122 Great, always clean place.
21123 The gym is great and never too crowded.
21124 I LOVE this place..
21125 This is my sushi bar.
21126 Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.
21127 I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.
21128 About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.
21129 With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.
21130 Especially if you like spicy (like me)!
21131 Even the non-sushi is great.
21132 This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.
21133 Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!
21134 $4.50!
21135 Go here.
21136 Try it.
21137 Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.
21138 I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!
21139 Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.
21140 Almost forgot!
21141 They have some big screen TV's!
21142 Watch sports here!
21143 They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..
21144 Just go.
21145 Now..
21146 Seriously.
21147 Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.
21148 You could be finding your keys..
21149 Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..
21150 Wear sandals.
21151 Save time.
21152 My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO.
21153 It was amazing!
21154 Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer.
21155 I also love the little grocery store.
21156 Very cute things to buy.
21157 Sunflower market is WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and has a lot more than Sprouts.
21158 It's my first choice of healthy grocery stores!
21159 They have the freshest produce around without it being full of bugs like Trader Joes.
21160 Their selection is very wide and their employees are really nice.
21161 Seriously I can't stand the employees at Whole Foods or Sprouts.
21162 They're such pretentious jerks sometimes.
21163 Whether I need lamb or bison meat, coconut milk ice cream, or almonds...this is always my first choice.
21164 They're also the only place in town that has every kind of vegan sliced cheese.
21165 Whole and Sprouts have some of them but which flavors are sporadic and random.
21166 I will never stray from Sunflower again!
21167 Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough.
21168 Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design.
21169 A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel.
21170 Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door.
21171 The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine.
21172 I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste.
21173 Score.
21174 I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili.
21175 Splendid.
21176 Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way.
21177 To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well.
21178 You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions.
21179 You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction.
21180 Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre.
21181 It will pay off handsomely.
21182 This charming little place not only has the BEST custom spray tan around - they can also whiten your teeth and have a rotating selection of adorable summer dresses on the cheap!
21183 If you are sick of being orange or baking under the harmful uv rays check this place out!
21184 First time clients get a discount!
21185 I will never go anywhere else!
21186 The Boulders was a first class experience all around.
21187 We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs.
21188 For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom.
21189 My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small.
21190 The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor.
21191 The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom.
21192 If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.
21193 The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list.
21194 Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall.
21195 A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.
21196 Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf.
21197 My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.
21198 There are places with cushier accommodations, but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulder's unique.
21199 I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff.
21200 I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.
21201 The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio.
21202 Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables.
21203 I really thought I was in for a great evening.
21204 Oh how wrong I was.
21205 My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door.
21206 Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair.
21207 I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back.
21208 It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.
21209 We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice.
21210 We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu.
21211 Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu.
21212 It's just so small that I missed it the first time.
21213 She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion.
21214 By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order.
21215 We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.
21216 While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages.
21217 It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress.
21218 She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table.
21219 When she did see me, she quickly ran outside.
21220 I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well?
21221 The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled.
21222 (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)
21223 Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters.
21224 It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad.
21225 My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager.
21226 I really, really regret that I did not.
21227 Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found.
21228 AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items.
21229 (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)
21230 Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was.
21231 My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay.
21232 He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware.
21233 The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.
21234 When she came back, I asked about my drink.
21235 With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink.
21236 It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3.
21237 Two seconds later, the food came out.
21238 At least we had silverware?
21239 1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay.
21240 Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?
21241 2) My friend's machaca was bone dry.
21242 Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible?
21243 All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal.
21244 Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone.
21245 This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.
21246 We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday.
21247 It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views...
21248 Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative.
21249 We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief!
21250 Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef!
21251 Nice touch...
21252 Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special.
21253 My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat.
21254 See pictures to see our meals.
21255 I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect.
21256 He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter.
21257 I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish...
21258 The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor...
21259 The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good.
21260 The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience..
21261 I can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!
21262 Great experience at Citizen PH...highly recommend the food and ambience trust me well worth the price!
21263 !
21264 You know when you get a really good cut and color..
21265 When the stylist is done and you look in the mirror and say "Wow, you did a great job.
21266 It looks awesome".
21267 Well that was my experience yesterday.
21268 I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy, but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous.
21269 It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them.
21270 My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life.
21271 I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months.
21272 She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect.
21273 The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked.
21274 I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me.
21275 I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color.
21276 When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldn't believe the price.. Cut and color for under $50.. WOW!
21277 I love the story time program here!
21278 I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat.
21279 The staff here is amazing!
21280 It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles.
21281 We look forward to this every week now.
21282 My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet.
21283 The first thing she does is come home and color it.
21284 I am so thankful for this free program.
21285 Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!
21286 :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.
21287 I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.
21288 Super neat place!
21289 :)
21290 ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning.
21291 thanks a lot guys!
21292 God Bless Lifetime Fitness.
21293 First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.
21294 Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.
21295 However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?
21296 Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.
21297 Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions.
21298 But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.
21299 First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.
21300 Especially at a gym.
21301 Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.
21302 Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.
21303 They love it.
21304 And I do too.
21305 WATERSLIDES?
21306 I mean come on.
21307 LoveitLoveit.
21308 Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.
21309 I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.
21310 You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.
21311 Who doesnt love that?
21312 You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.
21313 And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.
21314 My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.
21315 Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.
21316 I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.
21317 Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.
21318 Ingenious!
21319 I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.
21320 Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??
21321 Win-win situation.
21322 One of our Lexus car keys/key fob was cracked and needed to be replaced.
21323 Going to the dealer would be anywhere from $250-$400!
21324 I found Alcatraz on Yelp and called Todd.
21325 Todd did exactly what he said had to be done and the charge was $75.00.
21326 Todd is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing.
21327 Most other locksmiths couldn't do the job because they don't have the machine necessary to fabricate the key.
21328 I am a home inspector in the Phoenix metro area, and before I left with my new key, I took more than a few of Todd's business cards that I plan to give to my clients, so that when they move into their new home, they can call someone who is reliable, knowledgeable and trustworthy to help with their home security.
21329 Thanks, Yelp, as I found Alcatraz on your site.
21330 I love sakana.
21331 They have the best lunch time happy hour!
21332 Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced.
21333 :)
21334 Hard to find New York pizza that tastes like New York pizza.
21335 All the way from Morristown, NJ, this place is now the only place I order NY style pizza.
21336 I was here for the Yelp event recently and loved it.
21337 The facility was great and Yelp did a good job putting together the event.
21338 I noticed there was a lot to do there.
21339 I am already planning to come back with my nephews so I can have fun walking around the mock grocery store.
21340 I'm also looking forward to racing my nephews through the car wash on tricycles.
21341 Bring energy when you come and prepare to have fun.
21342 Empty tables.
21343 Told 15 minute wait.
21344 Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes.
21345 We left at that point
21346 Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !'
21347 I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place.
21348 I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.
21349 This was -not- a good bowl of pho.
21350 grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.
21351 Weird looks from the server.
21352 I don't think I'll be back.
21353 Not much else I can say
21354 Had a bad day yesterday and decided my health-conscious lunch would *not* cut it as far as getting me through my work day.
21355 I've always loved VSC & have had their menu at my desk but I hadn't been in a while.
21356 Put an order together w/ some co workers & called.
21357 I was read to go pick it up, but then they told me THEY DELIVER!
21358 I don't believe they did the last time I'd been there.
21359 Went out on a limb & tried the Dead Head wrap - soooo good and WELL worth the price b/c it's huge.
21360 I almost took off a star b/c their pasta salad is NOT what it used to be.
21361 I don't know if they changed it or if they are just inconsistent in making it, but it was kind of embarrassing that I'd told my coworkers how awesome it was just to have it come out not so great.
21362 What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.
21363 Jason is the best.
21364 The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.
21365 I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.
21366 Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.
21367 Well what can I say about this place?
21368 The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.
21369 Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.
21370 The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.
21371 Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.
21372 I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.
21373 Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.
21374 But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.
21375 I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.
21376 This place did not fail me.
21377 So will I be back?
21378 Umm that's a yes!
21379 Most horrible buffet I have ever been to.
21380 My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans.
21381 A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing.
21382 We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.
21383 Dear lord.
21384 The food is awful here.
21385 Inedible.
21386 Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.
21387 The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak.
21388 not exactly asian fare..
21389 I tried really hard to like this place.
21390 My boyfriend didn't like any of it either.
21391 I don't understand how they have such good ratings.
21392 The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt.
21393 It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland.
21394 haha.
21395 In short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage.
21396 Fantastic.
21397 Absolutely fantastic.
21398 I recommend OHSO for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill.
21399 I was really shocked when I dined at OHSO for a Sunday brunch.
21400 I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery; boy, was I wrong.
21401 This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer.
21402 Let me say this with more clarity: great food differentiates this place, not the huge variety of beers.
21403 This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food.
21404 The "Burger + Cheese" is simply awesome.
21405 A GREAT brunch dish is the "Breakfast Burrito" as well as the "Breakfast Flatbread."
21406 These guys are great!
21407 They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office.
21408 Easy to work with and good prices.
21409 Thanks!
21410 One of my favorite places  to get Indian food.
21411 I'm vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from.
21412 My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian.
21413 I'm so glad Udupi reopened.
21414 I suppose you could just put me in the "box" with "Luis T" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry..
21415 So i was here this week.
21416 Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.
21417 I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are "No Split Checks" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?
21418 We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.
21419 And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.
21420 Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.
21421 We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.
21422 How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!!
21423 Oh yes and D: Check please.
21424 We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.
21425 When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!!
21426 We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice "They are complaining about the service" to an audience that didnt exist.
21427 Damn right!
21428 and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.
21429 Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave!
21430 you should be ashamed!
21431 Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed.
21432 The people are great.
21433 The food is ALWAYS good & it doesn't matter what you get, they will cater to your needs & wants.
21434 Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here, you need to try it.
21435 Wow...
21436 I regress into some sort of '90s Valley Girl stereotype when chirping in delight over how good Switch is!
21437 How I was missing  a review for a Short List restaurant that I recommend to ev-er-yyyyy one I meet who is new to Phoenix and even remotely cool!
21438 ?
21439 Switch is reliably good food served in a reliably good atmosphere by reliably good servers.
21440 The combination of service, setting and grub makes Switch a go-to for affordable dining that has appeal for a wide variety of people.
21441 If I think that someone might be too uptight or too culinarily 'safe' to really enjoy Fez I know that I can take them to Switch, they can hone in on comfort food basics and I will still have an enjoyably awesome dining experience myself because all the basics are done with love, care and actual effort.
21442 I think I prefer Switch's menu to Fez's because of the combination of classic choices mixed in with flavor play and more diverse fare.
21443 And we end up at Switch a lot because they have awesome outdoor loungey space which works for friends who are smokers and for a quieter, more intimate chic and cool dinner-drinks and gossip night.
21444 It's really a gift to have this place in Downtown and a real gem in the Valley overall.
21445 We have on occasion had our asses kicked by the bar, specifically by the Drunken Italian Sodas which are so very, very good!
21446 Love their pizza and atmosphere.
21447 Their Caesar salad is really good too.
21448 They had a great deal during the summer, where we got 2 salads, 1 large pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine for $40.
21449 I recommend making OpenTable reservations, as this place is small.
21450 I had a great dining experience and I enjoyed the drinks and food.
21451 Margaret (sp) was a great server.
21452 I like to dine at local places like this, particularly those that make their drink mixes in house and use locally sourced food [when possible].
21453 The drinks I had were great: Aloe Arizona, The Kingston Rum Punch and Piña Colada Redux
21454 I had a dish with red snapper and vegetables; which was excellent.
21455 I had rice and peas on the side, the rice was not the best however; it seemed too dry.
21456 My friend had the prawns, I did not taste it, but the presentation looked good.
21457 She also had the coconut water which was served in a coconut - it was great and she mentioned it complimented the prawn dish.
21458 For desert I had a Créme Brûlée made with pineapple and rum.
21459 Fantastic place!
21460 we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem.
21461 Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked.
21462 They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house.
21463 The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price.
21464 Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!
21465 This place is the truth.
21466 It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine.
21467 The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama.
21468 The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell.
21469 Awesome.
21470 Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m.
21471 Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony.
21472 We enrolled our son in this program.
21473 It was EXCELLENT!
21474 Of our three children who have learned to drive we have observed that he is the most safety conscious and the best "new" licensed driver.
21475 Thank you, Driving MBA, for the peace of mind you have given us.
21476 I love this place.
21477 The food is clearly made with love and the folks there are so inviting and warm.
21478 Great vibe.
21479 Great food.
21480 Great price.
21481 You can bet the next time I visit Phoenix, I'll be coming back to Tiny's ;)
21482 Kind of surprised myself, but I have to give them a five.
21483 Let's begin with the drink was excellent.
21484 I had some kind of pom martini that was one of the best I've had in a while.
21485 I ordered the sirloin steak cobb salad.
21486 My salad arrived two minutes after the people I was eating with, and it was taken off the bill....they also brought us a free dessert and apologized...really?
21487 That's good service.
21488 They may have even gone overboard, but I didn't complain.
21489 The food itself was excellent.
21490 I loved my salad, and it was a nice size portion.
21491 All in all, a great experience.
21492 Awesome carne asada, veggie taco and just about everything else.
21493 Delicious and very easy on my wallet.
21494 This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.
21495 Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).
21496 I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.
21497 I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space.
21498 It amazes me that they have survived all this time.
21499 And, boy, am I glad they have.
21500 A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.
21501 If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.
21502 Heck, I'd even buy them a bigger place if I could!
21503 This is one of the last truly independent record stores.
21504 I'm happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well.
21505 Edit: They closed down on 12/31/10.
21506 I'm going to miss them.
21507 Hopefully they'll reopen somewhere else, even if it is only online.
21508 My regret is that I didn't have enough money to do one final run through there.
21509 Not recommended if you're not white.
21510 For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group.
21511 I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like.
21512 D&B bowling lanes are better.
21513 Let's talk about failure, baby.
21514 Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue.
21515 Go for it!
21516 I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).
21517 What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.
21518 The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).
21519 The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.
21520 This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.
21521 Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF.
21522 It's really *that* terrible.
21523 I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.
21524 This place is awesome.
21525 A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose.
21526 They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees.
21527 These are HUGE so come hungry!
21528 Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.
21529 The place is pretty divey but in a really great way.
21530 I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon.
21531 Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.
21532 They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it.
21533 I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.
21534 Highly recommend it if you are in the area.
21535 Huge fan of Bikram yoga!
21536 It's a 90 minute, torturous-at-times, sweat-filled  workout but when you are done, you feel insanely amazing.
21537 The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zen....Road rage?
21538 Gone.
21539 Annoying food cravings?
21540 Zero.
21541 Jeans?
21542 Fitting awesome.
21543 You really must try it, it can completely change your body.
21544 There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram, most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga.
21545 The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it, and I like it the best so far.
21546 They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well.
21547 Like other studios, this place offers first timers a week-long pass for around $20.
21548 What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice.
21549 I've have been going to another studio lately (for their first-time student deals) and their instructors bark out instructions non-stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time.
21550 So when you're staring up lying in your relaxed state, your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent.
21551 I'll very likely return here after I've exhausted the new student deals at the studios around the valley.
21552 Yoga can be expensive!
21553 Excellent food and service!
21554 GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERY
21555 With a little help you can drink & choose from about 25 beers, 8 scothes,10 whiskeys,8 Really good tequila's (just ask me) along with the every day vodka's & some pretty impresive wines (or whines).
21556 Don't miss this little gem in the rough & com listen to music or watch sports or just drink.
21557 Oh yea the owners are OK also
21558 Love this place.
21559 Great staff!
21560 Friendly, fun and knowledgable.
21561 The food is always good.
21562 What started out as a simple attempt to find a perfect birthday present turned into a life-long relationship with a fantastic jeweler.
21563 I wanted to get my fiancé (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style.
21564 I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst.
21565 I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to.
21566 Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices.
21567 I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park.
21568 The super friendly staff made everything easy for me.
21569 There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didn't want.
21570 They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person.
21571 After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom.
21572 At first  I was thinking "here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!
21573 ", but I was all wrong!!
21574 !
21575 We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds.
21576 I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers.
21577 I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park.
21578 In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow.
21579 Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me.
21580 I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want.
21581 So Hyde Park said "how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set".
21582 I was like, seriously?!!
21583 You can just do that??
21584 ?
21585 In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life.
21586 They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set.
21587 This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesn't have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision.
21588 Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me!
21589 I have concerns about Heirloom.
21590 Not about the food, which is fantastic (not quite 5 star fantastic, but 4.5 star fantastic).
21591 Nor the service, which is friendly and helpful.
21592 Nor about the atmosphere (well, somewhat about the atmosphere...it's quite lackluster).
21593 My concern is that Heirloom claims to be fine dining for our current economic times, when $50 entrees seem obscene.
21594 But what they've done is create a menu of less expensive small plates where you need to order at least 3 per person to be totally full, so you end up spending as much if not more as you would at other high-end establishments.
21595 On my visit, the place was practically dead.
21596 Granted, it was a weeknight, but I can't see how a place can survive with only 3 of its probably 15+ tables occupied.
21597 Especially not in such a high rent location, where restaurants have dropped out like flies.
21598 The menu changes weekly, which is really nice if you go to a place often, but who could possibly afford to come here often?!
21599 If you do go, they have a $25 off coupon on their website.
21600 Not 25 percent...25 DOLLARS!
21601 I would love to return to Heirloom every month to try chef Michael DeMaria's latest culinary creations, but that's certainly not within my budget.
21602 I'm afraid others have the same problem and that this place won't be around for long.
21603 Therein lie my concerns, because I really did love my meal!
21604 I don't drink a lot of coffee, but I'm a fan of tea.
21605 Especially strange tea that I probably can't pronounce right.
21606 Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch.
21607 Yep, I'm a fan of Lapsang Souchong.
21608 But I'm not a fan of "foofy".
21609 And that's one thing that Tea infusion is not.
21610 It's not foofy.
21611 It's funky.
21612 It's fun.
21613 And everyone who works there is really friendly.
21614 Beyond the teas, the food is good, too.
21615 I don't know that I'd eat there every night, but it's a wider variety than I'd expect at a tea place.
21616 This is a regular stop of mine.
21617 Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!
21618 We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in.
21619 I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed.
21620 We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it.
21621 The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience.
21622 My husband called me from work one day after a coworker had brought in several dozen bosa donuts and he said, "I've just had the best donuts I've ever eaten".
21623 Me, being a pastry lover, had to give it a try.
21624 We went early one morning and got one of every donut they had, they were awesome!
21625 The place is a little hole in the wall and had I not been told to go, I probably would have never gone in.
21626 The donuts were soft and fresh, the cinnamon crumble one was my favorite, and they were also reasonably priced.
21627 We live in ahwatukee so it's a little out of our way, but we will definitely be coming here again!
21628 The theater itself I have no problem with.
21629 Its the fact that we came out of the theater to a broken out driver passenger window, my doors unlocked and some Dumb Ass broke into my car and didn't even take anything.
21630 Really?
21631 ?
21632 I should've known better given the area but it was the only Harkins showing the movie we wanted to see.
21633 Security was nice enough to leave a note on my window.Can you believe there's No Cameras in the parking lot at all!!
21634 Ugh!!!
21635 Disappointed customer to say the least.
21636 Will not be back there that's for sure.
21637 I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.
21638 Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.
21639 I will definitely recommend them!
21640 Best Thai food!!!
21641 Order the dry garlic chicken.
21642 Tried Shorty's today, sadly it will be my one and only visit.
21643 To begin service was mediocre at best, portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider), and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger.
21644 That's when customer service went down the drain, all we got was a "that's weird" and an I'm sorry.
21645 If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back.
21646 Something, not just sorry for your luck.
21647 I will stick with RocketBurger, just up the street, cheaper, bigger portions, tasty and most important, they got great service.
21648 If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words I'd say"DON'T DO IT"!!!
21649 !
21650 San Felipe's Cantina will always have a special place in my heart.
21651 I've been coming here since it opened, and I haven't been disappointed yet!
21652 Here's some of my favorite things about them:
21653 Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley.
21654 Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30.
21655 You can't beat that!
21656 Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town!
21657 They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours.
21658 The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special.
21659 It works!
21660 Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea.
21661 It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka.
21662 As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce.
21663 A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)
21664 Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe.
21665 I'll definitely be back!
21666 The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)
21667 Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.
21668 I highly recommend the hog and chick.
21669 You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.
21670 * = best ever, ever, ever
21671 I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.
21672 Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!
21673 North Valley always has interesting articles to read and cool interviews with people like Alice Cooper and Young MC (Bust a Move!
21674 ).
21675 The magazine covers the entire north valley, which is very spread out.
21676 And you can find it in many different places, from Kierland to Anthem.
21677 It's free, but you can also get a subscription online.
21678 Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.
21679 If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in.
21680 The food quality is consistent.
21681 Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here.
21682 They are also serving cupcakes.
21683 Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.
21684 I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.
21685 Tasty.
21686 First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!
21687 honestly.
21688 We went here 3 times.
21689 all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were "past happy hour time" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.
21690 blah blah blah  P
21691 then they always have to "get a manager" to come to the table, which takes forever!
21692 (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS!
21693 THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!
21694 this is a definitely bait and switch!
21695 1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...
21696 2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.
21697 My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.
21698 The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.
21699 We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...
21700 3rd time...  took a friend there.
21701 again we ordered devils ale.
21702 on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.
21703 We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.
21704 I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.
21705 If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.
21706 We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.
21707 They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!
21708 oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have.
21709 Go here if you live in AZ.
21710 It fills the void in my life being a native Oregonian missing Deschutes Brewery.
21711 I must admit though, I've only been here once because its a difficult place to dine with a 15 month old child.
21712 Might want to get a babysitter for this one.
21713 Their emu oil is great.
21714 I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.
21715 I highly recommend it.
21716 We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.
21717 No dyes, fully refined, I love it.
21718 Worst customer service of any grocery store I've ever been in.
21719 EVER!
21720 I'd rather go to any other Safeway or any other grocery store.
21721 I'll drive the extra 10 miles just to avoid this place.
21722 I've only been to Postino's twice, both times for breakfast.
21723 And both times, I ordered the same thing: french toast.
21724 I'm not a big french toast kind of guy, but I absolutely loved them both times, and I look forward to the next brunch opportunity there.
21725 Might want to get here early though - we arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday and there were only a couple of tables still open.
21726 By 10am, there was a significant line.
21727 Best Italian sub I've had.
21728 Very nice owners.
21729 Just be aware there's no place to sit, so you'll have to get it to go.
21730 Decided to give this place a chance and was quite delighted.
21731 I am vegan and that's an issue sometimes.
21732 I tried the vegetable chow mein(medium spicy) and I love it.
21733 I get extra broccoli and there is so much flavor in the veggies and noodles.
21734 My husband has tried the General Tso's chicken, The BBQ pork chow mein, the mu shu pork and the garlic chicken and he loved them all.
21735 The great thing is that this is a family run business and it shows in the food.
21736 I highly recommend at least trying this place.
21737 it's reasonably priced and there are great lunch specials during the week.
21738 I really like this Urgent Care!
21739 Don't let their youthful looks fool you!
21740 John Altic PA-C and Dr. Brenden McRae are wonderful and very caring!
21741 In addition to having Urgent Care they are now opening a Private Family Practice -I can't wait for them to be my primary care physicians as well.
21742 Great job gentlemen and staff!
21743 So many great accessories and cute clothes!
21744 I got my accessories for my Wedding here, and they were perfect.
21745 Everything from clutches to earrings, from cute tops to watches, they have everything color coordinated!
21746 Cant say enough good things about Sens.
21747 Excellent food and excellent service.
21748 Okay, you might be asking yourself "who reviews a Taco Bell?
21749 or even looks up reviews for Taco Bell?"
21750 Well, I would ask myself that if I were you, but here we are.
21751 This Taco Bell is awesome.
21752 They have really nice and friendly people working for them, and my husband and I would eat inside because we liked the service.
21753 We lived a block away, and came every so often over 3.5 years and it was always the same.
21754 We appreciate that kind of good service, and it's not one you would expect to get from a fast-food chain.
21755 It is great.
21756 Great ambiance, food, and service.
21757 I love the rooftop bar too.
21758 My daughter's 128i BMW was horribly keyed this summer and we found Harvil's through State Farm Insurance.
21759 Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service.
21760 She dropped her car off on Monday I believe and she had the car back by Friday.
21761 His rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected, and what we liked about him is that he was very honest.
21762 My daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and hadn't gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around $500 and couldn't do that, but because Harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her $100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice.
21763 He also set us up with a rental car for her through Hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient.
21764 All in all, Fred Harvil was very pleasant to work with, timely, and left her car looking like new.
21765 Definitely recommend!
21766 Introduced to D'lish today by a friend.
21767 I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee.
21768 I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.
21769 When I ordered, the server suggested a "Sexy Dirty Chai", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla.
21770 The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink.
21771 The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem.
21772 The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)
21773 We love this place.
21774 We got Miss V washed up with the highest package with an extra leave-in conditioner for her super shedding coat AND she got some hand baked peanut butter doggie treats (all for $22).
21775 SO worth it.
21776 Plus: all the employees are SO nice!
21777 And now that they are starting to carry her dog food (Blue Buffalo), we'll be headed to Wag N' Wash for her chow too.
21778 LOVE.
21779 It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.
21780 Well my search is over.
21781 I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.
21782 Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.
21783 I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.
21784 The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.
21785 Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed....
21786 LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!
21787 always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!!
21788 BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)
21789 Not a fan.
21790 I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.
21791 As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.
21792 I did not have any cash on me so I took out my "plastic money" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.
21793 What store has a minimum nowadays??
21794 ?
21795 The customer service was also very lack luster.
21796 The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying.
21797 Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.
21798 There are so many other great dog stores...
21799 Wow.....  Not in a good way
21800 The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese!
21801 Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives!
21802 P.S.
21803 snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!
21804 With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (don't tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.
21805 We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.
21806 After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.
21807 Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.
21808 The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.
21809 After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.
21810 I hope we go back, but majority rules.
21811 I used to love Banana Republic.
21812 I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits, I wasted quite a bit of time in this store...to an frazzeling degree.
21813 The choppy layout of the new store is annoying.
21814 The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach.
21815 I was looking to dress sharp and professional, not wrinkled and hap-hazzard.
21816 I wanted short sleeves, not flimsy spagetti straps, long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (hello..its JUNE...and ARIZONA.)
21817 Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL.
21818 Kara is absolutely wonderful!
21819 She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon.
21820 The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person.
21821 I would highly recommend her!
21822 Never disappointed with this place!
21823 Get the brisket, get the pork.
21824 Get the beans.
21825 They're bangin'!!!!!!
21826 The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too.
21827 The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans.
21828 Do NOT skip the beans.
21829 Trust me.
21830 I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right.
21831 Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did.
21832 Makes for great leftovers.
21833 Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too.
21834 Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good.
21835 Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food.
21836 It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy.
21837 I've never actually dined-in at this place.
21838 I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window.
21839 They are pretty fast.
21840 My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner.
21841 Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner?
21842 Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends.
21843 I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!
21844 I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.
21845 There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.
21846 So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.
21847 And they think it's cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the "rawness" of this part of central Phoenix.
21848 And what is everything "Barrio Cafe"???
21849 ?
21850 Pretentious service.
21851 LOUD dining room.
21852 NO parking.
21853 Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime.
21854 High prices.
21855 Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.
21856 Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.
21857 It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.
21858 The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.
21859 I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.
21860 I guess that's capitalism.
21861 Like that new car, by the way.
21862 Hospitality Suite Resort was my home away from home this last week and although they are not a posh spa type resort, they were filled with heart and gave me everything I needed in the seven nights I spent there.
21863 Why did I chose Hospitality Suite Resort?
21864 I needed a place for seven nights (eight days) while I worked on my qualifying exams and worked on my dissertation in Phoenix.
21865 I had two basic needs, a place that was cheap and had free internet.
21866 That they had a daily breakfast was a plus, as was laundry facilities.
21867 They had the best price for all these options, so I jumped.
21868 After a flight to Sky Harbor, getting a rental car, driving to Scottsdale, I had a hard time finding the hotel.
21869 I finally asked another hotel on Scottsdale Ave. and she said, "OH yeah, the numbers are funny that way!"
21870 Ha!
21871 Very funny.
21872 After that first time, I didn't have any trouble finding my way back to it again.
21873 My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward.
21874 I was pretty much set.
21875 I was greeted by a fellow named J.J. who talked very fast (or maybe because of my travel and the time, I was processing very slowly).
21876 He gave me a room on the third floor that was "overlooking the pool" (P.S.
21877 all rooms are "overlooking the pool").
21878 He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was.
21879 It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands, but eventually I did.
21880 There were some British/French kiddos hanging out in the poor area, whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge, but it didn't matter, I was so tired, I could have fallen asleep in a airplane (oh, wait, I did that too!
21881 ).
21882 The next morning, I took in more of my surroundings.
21883 My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower.
21884 The was a lovely full-sized ironing board and steam iron.
21885 There was a coffee maker in the kitchen, along with a toaster, microwave, fridge (small) and hotplate.
21886 There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easy-to-use clock radio.
21887 There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs.
21888 The king size bed was comfortable, but not overly so.
21889 I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there, but I didn't have a trouble getting out of bed either.
21890 Perfect.
21891 Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts.
21892 The menus were laminated, meaning the that choices did not change, but that was ok.
21893 I chose two eggs, sausage, hash browns, whole wheat toast, oj and coffee every morning.
21894 By the second day, I was greeted by name.
21895 That was a nice touch, because I felt that I was very very far away from home.
21896 Instead of eating out every night, I went to Food City, just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro.
21897 I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn.
21898 Ahhhhh... all the comforts of home.
21899 Because I was up late working on my classwork, the partying didn't bother me.
21900 The pool was a magnet for people, even at night, because it finally was cooling down.
21901 I didn't go to any of the happy hours (friends don't let friend write on their dissertation drunk), but they sure looked like people were having fun!
21902 Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own non-reading of the map.
21903 I made this huge circuitous route because I didn't know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying.
21904 Next time I will know!
21905 !
21906 All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort.
21907 Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities (you don't need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby).
21908 Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good!
21909 Yep, next time I would stay at Hospitality Suite Resort, it's got it all.
21910 I LOVE the pretzels!
21911 Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip, but hey, garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups.
21912 Great atmosphere, can always see a game on one of the many TVs, even when my girlfriend thinks I'm paying attention to her!
21913 Milk stout is my favorite beer, but the light isn't bad either.
21914 Something tells me the others are good too, but it's hard to get me to stray from my patterns.
21915 Oh well, I'll leave someone else to review those.
21916 All in all, the food and beer is great, and the servers seem to know what they're doing too.
21917 I was very impressed with the service and food.
21918 St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.
21919 I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.
21920 My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.
21921 As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).
21922 Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.
21923 On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).
21924 I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.
21925 Wow.
21926 I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.
21927 The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.
21928 The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).
21929 Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.
21930 The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.
21931 The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.
21932 The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.
21933 Though I ordered the dish "spicy," the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.
21934 The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.
21935 I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.
21936 I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.
21937 I found the food excellent, but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety.
21938 Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side.
21939 It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didn't haven't issue about it.
21940 The menu isn't extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and they'd be willing to do it.
21941 I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large.
21942 Its a fatty, and I loved it.
21943 When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with.
21944 I was so happy.
21945 Most have no idea, and aren't very polite if you ask.
21946 She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there.
21947 I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night.
21948 Which was great.
21949 The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it.
21950 I"m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas)
21951 Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind.
21952 There is a difference!)
21953 Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film.
21954 Price is average sit down if not a little high.
21955 Expect 2 people = over 30 dollars.
21956 RUDE RUDE RUDE
21957 I wanted to book a diner for my wife and I ( our anniversary.
21958 .
21959 The website i was on did not post the times of operation.
21960 I left a message and today got a call back from a RUDE Owner.
21961 He argues it is right there.
21962 He did not ask anything about where i was o tried to help .
21963 He called to argue  with me.
21964  I can not believe i get a call at work and then when i tell the reason of the issue he argues with me and hangs up... childish behavior .
21965 I read the reviews on DEX and other sites and found that this is true across the board.
21966 Poor food prep and pretentious environment and owners... good bye Lon's  chief - ill never go to your location now.
21967 And my 12,000 Sedona list will  be aware of your bad manners.
21968 I am a native to Scottsdale and Lon's was a place that we went to almost 6 times a year.
21969 It was my mother's favorite place to eat.
21970 - until the food started going down hill.
21971 I believe it was these people who were at the helm at that time.
21972 I heard they were asked to leave.
21973 Hanging up on people.... this is incredible...   DO NOT GO HERE!
21974 !
21975 I love CK's.
21976 Their happy hour specials are great, service is awesome, and food is tasty.
21977 Try the adovada pizza...it's goooood.
21978 Ohhh this is the best place ever!
21979 Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
21980 My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short
21981 -Greeted immediately
21982 -Lots of variety
21983 -Meat lovers pizza is amazing
21984 -Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server
21985 -Will be back, loved the excellent service!
21986 !
21987 This has become one of my favorites.
21988 They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.
21989 My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.
21990 My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.
21991 One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.
21992 The sauces are light and fresh tasting.
21993 Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.
21994 When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.
21995 I have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant.
21996 You want good food?
21997 You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.
21998 You want scenery?
21999 Try desert.
22000 You want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight?
22001 Well you are in the desert so you'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first.
22002 You want a relatively close connection for your flight?
22003 Well tough shit.
22004 Oh yeah, they've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people's legs.
22005 Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.
22006 Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!
22007 ?
22008 Yummmmm .... so authentic
22009 This is one of the few mom & pop's type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic
22010 This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town, way better than the big chain like Brios (don't get me wrong, they are not bad either)
22011 It is not a fancy place but very cozy.
22012 And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia .... the owners are 100% italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients ....
22013 I had the best lasagna there, you can taste the texture of the noodle, the creamy-ness of the chess, the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes... totally awesome.
22014 Had tried the seafood linguine there too .... oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood ... definitely 2 thumbs up.
22015 During winter, make sure you make reservation ahead though .... this place seems to be snowbirds' favorite too
22016 What a beautiful hotel!
22017 The Clarendon is truly one of a kind.
22018 The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful.
22019 I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel.
22020 What an astonishing young man he is!
22021 I don't know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as "green" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door.
22022 I can't wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!
22023 My friends kidnapped me for my birthday (yes, because they are wonderful), threw me in the back of my friend Jill's van and rushed me off (blindfolded of course) to Radio Milano.
22024 My friend Lindsay knew I had been dying to go there (I love Postino--same owner and across the street--so I just knew Radio Milano was going to be amazing).
22025 I've never met the man that owns these restaurants: La Grande Orange, Postino, Radio Milano etc (Lindsay apparently once did, lucky girl) but whoever he is, he is a business genius.
22026 The atmosphere of Radio Milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight.
22027 Everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful.
22028 True to form for this restaurateur's style, there is a large vase of (fresh every day) flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general.
22029 Our server welcomed us with what were presented as "Italian Potato Chips" and a delicious dipping sauce.
22030 The homemade ginger ale is so strong in taste, really good.
22031 I ordered the special for the night which was a vegetable lasagna.
22032 It was soooooo good.
22033 I'm glad I have such awesome friends to kidnap me and take me to great places.
22034 We had a fantastic experience here!
22035 We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June.
22036 The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60.
22037 For Scottsdale, this is a steal!
22038 We shared an appetizer and a main entree.
22039 The appetizer was delish.
22040 Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus.
22041 Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter.
22042 For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach.
22043 Fantastic.
22044 The service was also great.
22045 I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't!
22046 Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience.
22047 After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican.
22048 I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas.
22049 We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed.
22050 Egads.
22051 Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street.
22052 And thus begins the saga.
22053 "Hi, are you here for happy hour?".
22054 We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway.
22055 At least we got a booth.
22056 Lucky us, huh?
22057 Joe "lots of product in his hair" brought us menus and took our drink orders.
22058 He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation "on the rocks with salt".
22059 My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered.
22060 The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time.
22061 .Really Joe product???
22062 Chips with the meal?
22063 FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them.
22064 It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table.
22065 At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo.
22066 The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table.
22067 Now the hubster's getting annoyed.
22068 It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table.
22069 Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop.
22070 Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table.
22071 By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge.
22072 Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager.
22073 Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head.
22074 Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house?
22075 Really?
22076 That's your solution?
22077 He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area.
22078 Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave.
22079 We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated.
22080 A free drink?
22081 Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright!
22082 As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry.
22083 I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them.
22084 Hubster had a steak and avocado salad.
22085 He said it was ok.
22086 This is a never return place for us.
22087 And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.
22088 The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good.
22089 I lived in AZ for a year whilst at JP Morgan.
22090 One of the few great experiences i had out there (back in LA now) was, going to their Good (yes, capital G) food places, they were really really, really Good...certainly on par with eateries I've experienced in London, NYC, Paris, et cetera.
22091 I finally found a neighborhood that had (gulp) personality: the Roosevelt district.
22092 I was so happy and comfy in my hundred-year-old guest house with hard wood floors, huge pre-air conditioning windows, a sizable green backyard, and an unobstructed view of the teenytiny Phoenix skyline.
22093 And just down the street from my extraordinary little residence was the absolutely amazing, wonderful and perfect Tammie Coe (the person AND the bakery) who had just opened their venerable doors.
22094 I was there every morning for their exquisite breads, cheeses, sweet things, perfect euro-standard coffee, lovely attendants....I miss it so much.
22095 It reminded me of Patisserie Valerie in London, or any good bakery in Paris...with a cool, fun and welcome American twist.
22096 I shall always go back to Tammie when ever I find myself in dreary Walmart-ized Phoenix.
22097 Tammie, you are an artist.
22098 My only hope is that you will consider opening a location in Los Angeles.
22099 Eat your heart out, Nancy Silverton!!
22100 !
22101 I am a G-Spot addict!
22102 Had to limit myself from going every week though.
22103 Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend.
22104 It was his first time to try gelato.
22105 He's a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato!
22106 The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!
22107 And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) "I eated it" and forgot to take a photo first.
22108 :)
22109 My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette!
22110 The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome!
22111 The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!
22112 !
22113 G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo.
22114 Baby C wanted something sweet!
22115 :D
22116 I take the light-rail downtown sometimes just to go here.
22117 I walked in the first time to a bustling, energetic, singing, cheering crowd and thought, "where the H am I??"
22118 I felt like I had left Phoenix and ended up in a far away magical land of wonder and excitement.
22119 Food is decent for a bar, great beer, great local music (it's the first time I saw The Waters).
22120 Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this.
22121 Great food.
22122 Good service.
22123 Salsa is the best.
22124 Enchiladas are very good.
22125 I don't know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!
22126 No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale.
22127 I went to Tommy V's for dinner last night with my husband and several of his clients...WOW!
22128 This is my new favorite restaurant in town!
22129 They have a private dining area that they can close off with curtains and turn the music off, which is perfect for a business dinner.
22130 I am vegan, one of his clients is doing the paleo diet, and another is gluten free, and they had DELICIOUS options for all of us, while also serving AMAZING pasta and fish dishes to others at the table.
22131 I can't recommend this restaurant enough.
22132 I am just sorry I haven't discovered it earlier.
22133 YUM!
22134 YUM!
22135 YUM!
22136 P.S.
22137 Very cool atmosphere, too!
22138 Update!
22139 Went back last night for dinner, this place is still awesome.
22140 I had the Las Vegas Rolls, they were pure deep fried goodness.
22141 Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world.
22142 Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list.
22143 Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed.
22144 And that is a lot of pizza.
22145 We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us.
22146 Bless her.
22147 Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery, adjoining, and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order.
22148 http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:4cXbhzxxtmExF9kRjmFViQ/src:self
22149 The only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours.
22150 So it goes.
22151 The pizza is worth the parking hassle.
22152 We're on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our "go" list again.
22153 The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time.
22154 A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.
22155 With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner.
22156 They really helped when we thought no one could.
22157 From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.
22158 Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype.
22159 I'm surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona.
22160 Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza I've had in the valley.
22161 The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza.
22162 The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent!
22163 Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table.
22164 Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family.
22165 It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time.
22166 ::Sigh::
22167 I love places like this.
22168 It is adorable and unique and intimate and perfect.
22169 The outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot (but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet) and the interior is small and intimate.
22170 I was surprised when I walked in as it was much smaller than I thought it would be- but who knows where I got the idea that it would be a gigantic place.
22171 Our server was hilarious and fun- he happened to be from Ohio and informed me he was a Buckeye (I'm from Michigan, but I'm not a Wolverine so Buckeyes usually don't hate me) and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state.
22172 He was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home (horrific sense of direction).
22173 I kind of wanted to be best friends with him.
22174 Anyway...
22175 I had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu (he brought me a sample first) and the Pasena.
22176 Both were great beverage choices.
22177 I also got to nibble on the tomato/mozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both.
22178 I'd go with the original.
22179 I dream of the day that I find such a cute little place on the West side (feel free to suggest one if I'm missing it).
22180 The atmosphere rocks, and the unique booze options only add to the charm of this place.
22181 We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.
22182 However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.
22183 When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.
22184 Never eating there again.
22185 I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy.
22186 But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.
22187 Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to.
22188 The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful.
22189 I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff.
22190 I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good.
22191 Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.
22192 Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.
22193 Tanzy, Yelp, and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event.
22194 I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing.
22195 I kept thinking we were done, but OH NO here comes another course.
22196 I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner.
22197 Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese.
22198 After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course.
22199 With never empty glasses of wine
22200 My Favs:
22201 Sweet Corn Risotto
22202 Scallops (cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm)
22203 Alaskan King Salmon
22204 Center Cut Filet Mignon
22205 Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts (Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING)
22206 4 hour braised beef short rib (Talk about melt in your mouth)
22207 Red Velvet Bread Pudding (I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter)
22208 I can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food.
22209 I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service.
22210 Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end 2012.
22211 I actually visited here about 5 months ago, but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words!
22212 I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place.
22213 It is part of their little slogan after all!
22214 I was not disappointed.
22215 I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus.
22216 Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious.
22217 And the portions were big, too.
22218 I didn't think I would be filled up after the meal, but I was stuffed!
22219 The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner.
22220 I was surprised they weren't getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court.
22221 They don't know what they're missing!
22222 i think this food is phenomenal.
22223 this was the first place i tried asian food in AZ when moving out here years ago.
22224 it has grown since then and the food is always top notch.
22225 for a late sunday afternoon lunch, the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy.
22226 our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled.
22227 it's been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i don't remember exactly what it was, but it had the big, wide rice noodles which i love.
22228 i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day.
22229 they ask how spicy and i've eaten thai food "spicy" and it is downright dangerous, so we opted for "medium" with a side of spice juice...which was HOT!
22230 we will continue to patronize Tottie's as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very, very, very good.
22231 and very reasonable prices.
22232 This place is beautiful, great patio with classic decor.
22233 Went to Happy hour...of course and had a few glasses of wine and  yummy calamari.
22234 Service was off the charts!
22235 We were sitting on the patio...a little hot and Schwetty...and the server kept moving the umbrellas to shade up as the sun set...WOW!
22236 I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens.
22237 They seem too precious, too "perfect" to be of much interest.
22238 And, let's face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost.
22239 That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic.
22240 Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, "wow, it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist."
22241 They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground.
22242 I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.
22243 The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two.
22244 Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk.
22245 I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.
22246 This place never grows old.
22247 It's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here.
22248 Great place.
22249 Hard to see behind Carl's Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!
22250 So sad to say, I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1.
22251 I had been a faithful customer of Katie's for years, at least 3 or 4!
22252 She told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.
22253 I was heartbroken.
22254 But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.
22255 Next appt I needed, I called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because Katie isn't doing nails anymore, right?
22256 I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.
22257 Very hurtful!
22258 I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.
22259 But needless to say, I don't go there anymore, haven't been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere.
22260 I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, "Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"
22261 I went there, and had an awesome time!
22262 Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon.
22263 I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it.
22264 Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name.
22265 It burned, but I loved it.
22266 I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy.
22267 (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course.
22268 I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good.
22269 She ordered the cheese enchiladas.
22270 (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min-
22271 Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while.
22272 Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food.
22273 It was fresh!
22274 Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros.
22275 Which is cool.
22276 Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's.
22277 I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want.
22278 Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that?
22279 Hatch chiles!
22280 I highly recommend them.
22281 I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles.
22282 It sets them apart.
22283 It brought the heat!
22284 After dinner, I ordered another margarita...
22285 This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation.
22286 Why do I do this?
22287 Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know.
22288 'Nuff said.
22289 He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name.
22290 It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say.
22291 Thanks!
22292 That's why this place gets 5 stars.
22293 It deserves it in my opinion.
22294 I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general.
22295 I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process.
22296 I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food.
22297 That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people.
22298 This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of.
22299 What a freaking great idea!
22300 Too hot for you?
22301 Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.
22302 I will surely be going back, and I won't have a bad time.
22303 The cool name of the place is the only good thing here.
22304 The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word?)
22305 messy.
22306 Fries, too greasy.
22307 Seating, not comfortable.
22308 Skip it!
22309 Good food, if all the Taiwanese comes here that means this is really good.
22310 This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!
22311 This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.
22312 Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!
22313 1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries
22314 2-Fresh ingredients and great prices
22315 3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out
22316 4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)
22317 5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)
22318 So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.
22319 Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here!
22320 But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10...
22321 I went to sears today to check on a layaway that I placed online but was going to pickup here.
22322 Margaret, the associate couldn't find me in her system so she personally called the sears.com help line to find out what was happening.
22323 She was friendly, professional, and extremely helpful in solving my problem.
22324 I went home a happy customer and am very thankful to Margaret for her help!
22325 This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here.
22326 There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.
22327 Shoes, and purses, and make-up - o my!
22328 Your sales totally RAWK guys!
22329 I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!
22330 I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.
22331 OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!
22332 Oooooooo, ya baby.
22333 All that glitters is NOT gold.
22334 (ok, it's the small things...)
22335 It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.
22336 Hey, I am a patient person....
22337 I stop for red - tags, that is.
22338 Great food, great prices, and great service.
22339 I am a big eater and could not even finish all my food for only 8 dollars.
22340 The orange chicken was fresh and tender with excellent flavor.
22341 The combo also came with fried wantons and spring rolls.
22342 Super far from my house, but worth the drive.
22343 Yes, before you ask, I still love Desert Stages Theatre, perhaps more than ever.
22344 This is Andrew's fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland.
22345 Normally, we don't ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so that's what we asked for this time during audition.
22346 And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.
22347 When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad.
22348 Why you may ask?
22349 Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.
22350 When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.
22351 I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment.
22352 He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.
22353 And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak!
22354 With each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.
22355 This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.
22356 It was great to see his awareness growing.
22357 I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.
22358 It will be an amazing experience!
22359 !
22360 Really, DST is about the kids.
22361 Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.
22362 Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.
22363 It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.
22364 It's all fabulous.
22365 If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.
22366 Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!
22367 For a boba drink fan like me, it is still rare to find a tea place that has authentic tea (and not just milk powder), hot or cold tea choices, and boba and tea that taste great individually or separately.
22368 I ordered an iced chocolate chai (yum!
22369 such a difference from plain old Oregon Chai used at most coffee houses) with boba.
22370 The only negative is that the drink was $4.91, but it was well worth it!
22371 Mmmmmmm love this place!
22372 My friend took me for a birthday lunch.
22373 John our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing.
22374 We shared the Stetson Chopped Salad and Fillet on Toast with leeks and homemade potato chips with blue cheese.
22375 The kitchen plate/split our fillet, always a plus.
22376 The salad with salmon, chicken is offered, was tossed tableside.
22377 CC always has it's own twist on offerings.
22378 The bread pudding and banana icecream were decadent.
22379  Wish I lived closer.
22380 well dang gummit....git on over here and by me some camo flawj....tha kind that has little dangly moss on it....and while yur at it, i need me a gun....
22381 too bad i already have a gun and camo.
22382 i use to be a big hunter....deer, dove, turkey, squirrel, ducks etc.
22383 it's what you do in south georgia when your fridge is empty and you're hungry.
22384 this bass pro shops is ENORMOUS!!!!!
22385 i love it.
22386 although i don't hunt anymore, my brother and father do, so every year i get gift cards for them from Bass Pro Shops.
22387 the gear and guns are more expensive than other places, but their selection is incredible.
22388 when my dad comes out here, i can't wait to take him here to see all the taxidermy and fish tanks...i know he'll love it.
22389 the staff is usually friendly.
22390 the firearms dept is a bit intimidating and the guys at the counter can be smart asses.
22391 but this place is just really neat overall.
22392 it is also a family retreat, so don't be surprised to see hundreds of kids running wild while their parents let them be terrors.
22393 I've been taking mine and my family's cars to Cathedral for more than a decade.
22394 We are always treated fairly, and always have a good experience - the guys always stand by their work and "go the extra mile" to be sure our cars are fixed properly.
22395 They work on both our new(er) cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s.
22396 Whenever anyone is looking for a mechanic, I will send them here without fail - and John and the guys at Cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone I send to them.
22397 In a business filled with some sketchy practices, I know that whether I send my wife, a friend, or a coworker to Cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly.
22398 Cars break and break down, that's a fact of owning one.
22399 I'm glad I have Cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so I can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible.
22400 Great happy hour specials.
22401 All the appetizers are delicious!
22402 Service is first rate and it's nice to sit outside on the patio.
22403 Great people watching without being too obnoxious!
22404 LOL
22405 This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata.
22406 That's about it!
22407 Yum!
22408 I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work.
22409 I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch.
22410 The deli is awesome.
22411 They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you.
22412 For 5.49 it's not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free.
22413 They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well.
22414 Very friendly, Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job.
22415 Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it!
22416 Imagine a white silk wedding dress.... black!
22417 Well, that may be a bit dramatic but it was pretty bad.
22418 More than 1.5 years after my wedding I took my dress in to Bell.
22419 They kept my dress for a couple weeks, called me when it was ready and I was so excited to see it almost new.
22420 They did a fantastic job and were careful not to over treat the lace and silk with chemicals.
22421 They made me feel like they really cared.
22422 The business is family owned and the man at the front is so nice to work with.
22423 And, the pricing was extremely fair.
22424 I paid $89 which was much more reasonable than other places I checked.
22425 I highly recommend Bell Cleaners.
22426 This is one super cool cafe/lounge.
22427 They serve coffee, cocktails, and some quick bites that can go along great with your drinks.
22428 There are several rooms you can choose from to sit and relax.
22429 Art decor surrounds this stylish joint and just had a great time here sipping on coffee and chatting with a friend who recommended this coffee shop to me.
22430 I noticed a younger adult crowd here but it doesn't matter.
22431 Wi-Fi friendly, too!
22432 Lots of "gay on gay" homophobia here.
22433 Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.
22434 Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.
22435 Oh well
22436 I hired Property AZ to rent my upside-down home in North Peoria (stuck with the house so we rent it out), they are very experienced and had great customer service.
22437 I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me.
22438 This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.
22439 Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.
22440 I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.
22441 This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.
22442 Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.
22443 Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.
22444 When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?
22445 After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.
22446 The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.
22447 Sazerac was tasty as well.
22448 Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.
22449 We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.
22450 We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts.
22451 (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.
22452 Soooooo good.
22453 As for the style of the place it is fantastic.
22454 Feels cool but not cliche.
22455 The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.
22456 As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while.
22457 Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner.
22458 It's both affordable and healthy.
22459 Thought it's usually  crowded with "Hipster" ASU students, I have yet to receive bad service.
22460 Our food has usually come out in a timely matter.
22461 As for the environment, It's very nicely decorated with art from local artists and it's very well lit.
22462 It's nice and open so you can see what's going on through out the restaurant.
22463 It's never to noisy, so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date.
22464 Almost every visit, I've always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap.
22465 The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful.
22466 The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink!
22467 Though I have not tried a lot on the menu, some of the food they bring out always make me say "Ooh, what's that?!"
22468 Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.
22469 First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.
22470 The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.
22471 They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake...
22472 I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.
22473 Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.
22474 Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy.
22475 Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics.
22476 The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall I'd say that the gig was pretty amazing.
22477 It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention.
22478 The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first.
22479 One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks.
22480 You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table.
22481 That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks.
22482 Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera.
22483 The show was wonderful.
22484 So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought.
22485 The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked :(.
22486 I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month.
22487 Yippee.
22488 You rock and we can't wait to try our hand at this exciting craft!!
22489 Huge props for Great customer service!
22490 !
22491 This restaurant has the best Italian food I have ever ate in my life!!!
22492 Definitely one of the best restaurants in AZ.
22493 I had the sautéed calamari for an appetizer, and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta.
22494 Their bread also melts in your mouth.
22495 Blown away by the service.
22496 Gilda was my server, and she was amazing.
22497 Everyone was super nice, professional, courteous, and sooooooo hospitable.
22498 I've never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson.
22499 SERIOUSLY.
22500 AMAAAAAZING restaurant!!!!
22501 !
22502 A must!
22503 One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley!
22504 Great service and quality, natural feed products for your dog.
22505 You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands.

22508 Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo.
22509 I've never seen critters so closeup before.
22510 At the Monkey Village, they don't even have cages.
22511 The giraffes came right up to us.
22512 I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays.
22513 It was a blast!
22514 We had great time!
22515 yow, bill
22516 PS - I've never commented on other people's reviews before.
22517 But jeez.
22518 When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkey's sake, get a clue!
22519 Great place!
22520 I've been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service.
22521 The servers are always friendly and attentive.
22522 I LOVE the sushi there.
22523 They have a lot of fun, new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille.
22524 The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too.
22525 Recently I've noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there.
22526 Baffled, I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling.
22527 Needless to say I'm excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille!
22528 They say you never forget your first.
22529 Well, Postino Central was my first Postino and I remember my first sip and bite like it was yesterday.
22530 The atmosphere here is very sexy at night.
22531 Candlelight and sexy music add to the already chic ambience Postino has.
22532 The food?
22533 Bliss.
22534 I can still remember how the creamy ricotta and sweet figs on my bruschetta tantalized my tongue that first night.
22535 I can feel the velvety red wine at the back of my mouth and drizzling down my throat.
22536 Parking is a bit of a hassle, but they have valet for a reason.
22537 If you're stuck waiting for a table, squeeze in at the bar and grab a glass of wine (or three).
22538 People watching is almost as fun here as eating.
22539 Now that there is a Postino in the East Valley, I am hoping Postino Central will get a little less busy... if only to serve my selfish purposes.
22540 I love everything about this place and I hope to be back soon.
22541 IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food.
22542 Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard.
22543 The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.
22544 The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good.
22545 I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily.
22546 The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.
22547 [update April 2, 2011]
22548 Why'd I go back?
22549 I hate this place now.
22550 We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast.
22551 I was excited to do this and was eager.
22552 I should've stayed home.
22553 My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy.
22554 The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.
22555 My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold.
22556 I sent it back and complained.
22557 I think she microwaved my plate.
22558 Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee.
22559 She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut.
22560 I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)
22561 Ok now it's three hours later.
22562 My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke.
22563 Seriously.
22564 The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.
22565 They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.
22566 This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least!
22567 Loved everything about the place.
22568 We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room.
22569 Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe.
22570 I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?)
22571 and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it.
22572 We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!
22573 !
22574 Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy John's?
22575 Or is that just when it's delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee?
22576 I've noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75
22577 That's not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub I've had.
22578 They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on.
22579 I'd much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy John's :-)
22580 everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to Karsh's.
22581 our intent is to buy bagels and we do, but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies.
22582 all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great.
22583 as for service, always with a smile and friendly attitude.
22584 we used to go here all the time when we lived on n. central, but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place.
22585 so please open one near us too.
22586 I took a cooking class with Chef Eddie Matney (Eddie's House Restaurant) and his recipe called for Vanilla bean olive oil from the Olive Mill.
22587 First off, what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there!
22588 I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his "bad boy favorite."
22589 I don't know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since I've had his food and was quite impressed.
22590 I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich.
22591 Such a cool atmosphere inside.
22592 It's like a trader joes/gift shop/paradise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel.
22593 You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.
22594 I couldn't believe the kalamata sandwich!
22595 If you go there and order anything else....you're wrong.
22596 Freshest ingregients I've ever tasted.
22597 I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden (which they do have there).
22598 Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there.
22599 Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well.
22600 Make for some unstoppable pancakes.
22601 Tried the gellato and wasn't all that impressed.
22602 But in all due fairness, I'm not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all I've had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon.
22603 Definitely worth the drive!
22604 Great place to bring the family.
22605 This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow.
22606 That's what they're licensed to sell.
22607 They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to).
22608 They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so.
22609 If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos.
22610 I love their milk.
22611 As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low).
22612 Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price.
22613 Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health).
22614 SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste).
22615 It's never made us sick, and we've been drinking it for 2 years.
22616 It's a miracle that this metro area actually has a dairy willing to sell fresh milk to the public!
22617 Thank you, Save Your Dairy!
22618 I've been to several local dermatologist and havent seen results or been fond of any; the staff is extremly friendly and very helpful!
22619 I highly reccomend this dr, he is knowledgeable & helped me attain the results I was looking for!
22620 Great movie theater----staff so friendly!!!
22621 If you love movies and comfy, clean theaters at reasonable price, check it out!!!!
22622 Parking so easy and close as well.
22623 Other restaurants have come and gone but this one has been there like what my wife said about 20 years existing in the area.
22624 Congratulations!!!
22625 I loved the old recipe sourdough pizza.
22626 I enjoyed it very much.
22627 Neighbors please help our local business survive.
22628 We need them to support our local community.
22629 I can summarize this in one word.
22630 YUCK!
22631 We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.
22632 We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.
22633 The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.
22634 We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as "well done" anyway.
22635 Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.
22636 At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.
22637 My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast, go somewhere else.
22638 This is how Caribbean food should be done.
22639 Excellent jerk chicken, perfectly cooked plantains, very good patties.
22640 I highly recommend this place if you are at all a fan of Caribbean food.
22641 Beautiful ,wonderful and very romantic ambient setting sets the tone for a romantic dinner with the one you love .
22642 We first experienced El Chorro back in early April ,and were so enchanted with our patio dining experience ..beautiful view of Camelback MTN.
22643 lovely flora and landscaping ,and their adorable organic garden area.
22644 That we have returned a few times ,and every visit has been wonderful -impeccable service and delicious fare.
22645 Dinner High-lights ;
22646 Niman Ranch Steak ,twice baked potato ,asparagus.
22647 Free Range Chicken, mashed and peas
22648 Chopped salad and the Chicken Cobb salad both fresh and delicious.
22649 Veggie pasta with shrimp .
22650 Drink High- lights ;
22651 Honey pot ( jack daniels lemonade drink)
22652 Mojito ( strawberry and Jalapeno) sooo good!
22653 The sticky buns are just sick !!
22654 we always take an order home .
22655 Fabulous !
22656 every time.
22657 I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation.
22658 I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often.
22659 However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices.
22660 I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe.
22661 Kudos on that.
22662 This is more than most places provide.
22663 However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free.
22664 Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct.
22665 (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)
22666 So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.
22667 When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above.
22668 However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp.
22669 I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.
22670 The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered.
22671 I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.
22672 As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable.
22673 But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.
22674 A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered.
22675 Except the pasta was undercooked.
22676 I don't mean really firm al-dente.
22677 I mean some were still way under done.
22678 Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me.
22679 But that bowl was almost inedible.
22680 The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl.
22681 I declined and soldiered through it.
22682 We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal.
22683 The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems.
22684 Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.
22685 I do not intend to go back.
22686 Dr. Farnsworth is the Jam.
22687 I had my first ever eye exam, and she was kind enough to take good care of me.
22688 She did a complete, and thorough eye exam, and explained each test, and the importance of them.
22689 After the exam, we determined, that I indeed needed glasses.
22690 At that point, my prescription was handed over to the very sweet optician who took care of me and let me try on about a dozen different frames before I found the winning pair.
22691 I've sadly lost them in Vegas, but I will soon be back to buy my next pair so that I am not blind as a bat.
22692 LOVE YOU GUYS!
22693 Wow this place was steps below horrible.
22694 I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night.
22695 The food was greasy, and flavorless.
22696 Everything on the plate was flat...
22697 Ya I said it.... Flat.
22698 Bland, disappointing food.
22699 Save your money and eat at taco bell.
22700 You will thank me later.
22701 Second to worst dining experience of all time.
22702 Our waitress was a little timid, which is fine, but it we shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.
22703 Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive, and while our friend's steak came out hot, our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.
22704 Sent it back to be warmed, they offered to pay for it, which is great.
22705 Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff, and made sure everything was great.
22706 That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.
22707 We finished our meals, and 10 minutes later, had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter, and to bring us cheesecake menus.
22708 We always get the Dulce de Leche, but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.
22709 I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said "no thanks, I'll just pass on the cheesecake."
22710 He looked surprised, and later said we didn't have to pay for that cheesecake.
22711 Well I'd sure hope not!
22712 Two hours of my life are gone.
22713 I usually like this restaurant, but tonight's service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again, free food or not.
22714 Hands down the best Vietnamese food we've found in metro Phoenix.
22715 Enormous bowls of delicious pho, served quickly with friendly and efficient service.
22716 Our "go to" place for pho now.
22717 Cheap too!
22718 Really, if I could, I would give this place zero stars, because it is a disgrace.
22719 If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/).
22720 It's also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it''s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel.
22721 At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.
22722 VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way.
22723 VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers.
22724 The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress.
22725 All they want is your money.
22726 They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an "emergency exam."
22727 We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).
22728 Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a "biohazard waste fee") that are irrelevant to the "service" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone?
22729 Conversely, our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less.
22730 VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham.
22731 Outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind.
22732 Real good.
22733 You don't expect to find a good restaurant in a strip mall, next to Costco, but Upper Crust is all of that.
22734 They have fantastic food, including fresh made mozzarella (made at the restaurant), really good chicken wings (ask for them crispy!
22735 ), and, yes, great pizza.
22736 There's always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate, which is great for both families and the no-kid crowd.
22737 And, now, that it's cooling off, you can finally enjoy the patio!
22738 From the outside you wouldn't guess the kind of school it is - its in a strip mall, its small, not very well known - but if you took the chance to come inside and see for yourself you would be very surprised and impressed.
22739 This is by far the best dojo I have ever run across.
22740 You are welcomed when you enter the door, all your questions are asked whether they seem stupid or not.
22741 You are treated kindly and with respect from the get go - a very warm place to walk into.
22742 I was so impressed with this place I signed my kids up immediately.
22743 They have so many types of classes and the variety and time schedule they really try and have it work around your family so you have your time as well.
22744 The teachers here are amazing and always do their best to make it the best class you have every time.
22745 I would recommend this dojo to anyone that asks me - and I do.
22746 If you haven't come into this place and tried it or have your kids try it then you should - you are missing out.
22747 Believe the hype.
22748 That's all I can say.
22749 This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds.
22750 I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i don't like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port.
22751 the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.
22752 i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!
22753 cheaper then the wine stores).
22754 they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.
22755 this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.
22756 despite it location it is a great place for a date...
22757 Truckin' Good Food is by far my favorite part of the Ahwatukee Farmers Market!
22758 So far, I have tried the Veggie crepe and the Bean and Cheese crepe and both were spectacular.
22759 For various reasons, it had been about a month since I had been able to meet up with their tent on Sundays and today I got my fix!
22760 Jeff and Erin are both so sincere and friendly, which makes it easy to hang out and chat while your crepe is made right in front of you.
22761 The care and attention put into each and every order really makes TGF stand out from the rest, the fresh, quality ingredients don't hurt either!
22762 Next week, I've got to try the PB&J!
22763 !
22764 Okay, so I admit it.
22765 Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of it's competitors.
22766 It took me a while to cave on this one.
22767 Too long in fact.
22768 Everyone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to!
22769 My latte was supremely delicious.
22770 The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service.
22771 I absolutely love the patio area.
22772 This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me.
22773 The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly.
22774 I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer.
22775 There's room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return.
22776 My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere.
22777 A+ for all in my humble estimation.
22778 I was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway.
22779 Not worth comin here.
22780 I'm all for food like this but this restaurant sucks.
22781 They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good.
22782 The meat was dry and the rice was cold.
22783 Not worth it.
22784 great service, efficient bartender, the place was packed and he flew around that place serving brewski's nonstop...awesome outdoor patio and great view of camelback...happy to see this little gem and will be back
22785 The best of all the Harkins.
22786 Better array of munchies and really friendly staff.
22787 Also, I wasn't overly carded on my inexpensive purchases.
22788 At the Superstition Springs location, I'm carded four times between the parking lot and my seat.
22789 Chances are...if I steal a credit card, I'm not gonna sit in the same spot for three hours awaiting the po-po.
22790 So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning).
22791 Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning.
22792 Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you can't beat it.
22793 The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good.
22794 I laughed when I got my latte in a "So I Married an Axe Murder"-esque cup.
22795 We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central.
22796 There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables.
22797 I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, you'll never get to sit there.
22798 That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time.
22799 My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past.
22800 Love it, love it.
22801 This place has really good mexican food and a very nice ambience.
22802 Finally a place where my kids and I both love the food that doesn't serve chicken nuggets and fries!
22803 My kids love Blue Burrito's kids chicken quesadilla, especially the churro that is included.
22804 I love their salads and taco plates.
22805 The free chips and salsa bar is a big hit with the family.
22806 The place is always super clean and the staff is very friendly.
22807 The perfect place for lunch on their new patio now that the weather is cooler.
22808 So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM!
22809 This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.
22810 The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!
22811 The Chefs Board is pretty good too!
22812 My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.
22813 Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff.
22814 The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.
22815 The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says "Complimentary" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want.
22816 We just completed our third tour with Taste It Tours and we've been impressed with all of them.
22817 All 3 tours are distinct and are loaded with excellent restaurants.
22818 I've spent quite a bit of time downtown, but it can be daunting and I haven't ventured much to explore and try new things.
22819 The tours take you to the places you may not notice as you whiz by, give the history (yes Phoenix has history), and overall just slow you down to take in the sights, sounds, and of course, food!
22820 Can't decide which tour to take?
22821 Start with the Original, then the warehouse and finally the evening.
22822 Really, they're all good!
22823 Tips: Have a light snack before starting the tour.
22824 Yes you do get a lot of food, but keep in mind that the tours start at 2pm or 6pm.
22825 You have introductions, overview, some history and then a short walk to the first restaurant.
22826 If you're skipping lunch, you might be very hungry when you arrive as the first restaurant.
22827 2) Wear comfortable shoes.
22828 You will be walking about 2 miles.
22829 Nothing strenuous or fast paced, but just be conformable (also wear comfortable clothing as you will get full).
22830 3) Pace yourself!
22831 Don't eat everything that is in front of you.
22832 Each restaurant gives a fair amount of food, now multiply that by 3+ more restaurants that remain on the tour...You get the idea.
22833 You will be full!
22834 Highly recommend for anyone: locals, out of town visitors, guests of locals, team building, etc.
22835 Really, who doesn't like food!
22836 Side Note: Taste it Tours was founded by a few Phoenix locals who love food and their city.
22837 They have only been around about a year now and have been doing extremely well.
22838 They base their business around supporting local businesses (local supporting local).
22839 I'm excited to see how well they've done and wish them all the best (More tours are in the works and I will definitely be taking them!)
22840 I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio.
22841 I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.
22842 I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos.
22843 I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more.
22844 To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos.
22845 She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos.
22846 She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for "side cheese."
22847 The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, "can you please put a little more cheese on my taco."
22848 This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito.
22849 I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.
22850 All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, "this will be extra."
22851 They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end.
22852 I will not be visiting this establishment again.
22853 As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money.
22854 Even though I've only been to Bosa once I've had the donuts from here several times.
22855 My parents have been coming here regularly (like, multiple times a week regularly) since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know I'm hungover in bed.
22856 Now, I'm only reviewing this place for the donuts.
22857 I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself, but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well.
22858 That being said, when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets.
22859 They're soft, chewy, and all around yummy...that goes for all varieties (well, the ones I've tasted anyway).
22860 Another good thing...they're CHEAP!
22861 It's not like donuts break the bank anyway, but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing.
22862 The place itself is not much to look at, but who cares!
22863 All I want is the donuts!
22864 Surprised this place isn't closed by now.
22865 Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.
22866 Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit.
22867 They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts.
22868 My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me.
22869 Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!
22870 I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.
22871 We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.
22872 And then we waited, and waited and waited.
22873 We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.
22874 But he was too busy talking.
22875 We got up and left.
22876 No one even said a word when we left.
22877 Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult.
22878 They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay!
22879 Enter, the Children's Museum of Phoenix!
22880 The facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy!
22881 After you pay your standard $11/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME!
22882 There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth.
22883 The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child!
22884 After your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor.
22885 Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as "Plinko-esque".
22886 Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms.
22887 My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...it's a shame she'll ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.
22888 After Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room.
22889 After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room.
22890 Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag.
22891 Such simple activities...such great opportunities!
22892 After cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor.
22893 Here, children get to play grown-ups.
22894 There's a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store.
22895 After shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery.
22896 We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest.
22897 We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels.
22898 Being only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling!
22899 How on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?
22900 I found this place completely by accident and it was great!
22901 I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente.
22902 I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh.
22903 ....
22904 Nothing is fried!
22905 The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me.
22906 The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot!
22907 Love it!
22908 Can't wait to go this week!
22909 The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently.
22910 Hopefully, they'll extend their hours soon.
22911 :)
22912 Great service!
22913 Great Value!
22914 Best in the valley hands down!!!
22915 !
22916 I am a second generation customer and as far as i can remember my mom has always took my clothes here, from my 8th grade promotion dress, my HS prom dress, my college graduation dress and now i take my husbands suits here!
22917 Park Avenue has been there for all of my wonderful growing years and hopefully will be here for my future children as well!
22918 !
22919 My mother always told me, if I didn't have anything nice to say, say nothing!
22920 great place to go and the pizza ia great too
22921 A couple Saturdays ago, went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen.
22922 We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes.
22923 The personal banker was great - in-out-done.
22924 Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM.
22925 They were quite busy, apparently.
22926 When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.
22927 I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it "shouldn't be long."
22928 30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take.
22929 Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers.
22930 My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.
22931 45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer.
22932 Jennifer said curtly, "We're busy."
22933 Apparently, on Saturdays, they're busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend.
22934 I don't recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years...
22935 Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be "two more minutes", as I had to go through their background check to be a member.
22936 They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number).
22937 After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my mom's account.
22938 I asked for Jennifer's card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.
22939 To that I received a reply she did not have one.
22940 The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays.
22941 My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me.
22942 I can make other arrangements or come in during the week.
22943 Being told first, "It shouldn't be long," and then, "We're busy" is not an excuse.
22944 If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait they're likely to experience because of the queue.
22945 Or don't open on Saturdays!
22946 As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor.
22947 After doing some searching for a new home for mom's money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK!
22948 I'm normally a big fan of member-owned institutions, but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union, I'd say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them.
22949 One of my fave places in Phoenix.
22950 Well stocked and friendly staff.
22951 I don't normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look.
22952 That's when Border's became one of my fave places.
22953 I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD.
22954 I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before.
22955 I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness.
22956 For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for.
22957 I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in.
22958 Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at.
22959 I bought that too!
22960 I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!
22961 Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service.
22962 The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare.
22963 You'll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since she'll trail behind you and fix the spoons.
22964 Yogurt sucks as much as the service, so I don't recommend.
22965 This is going to be brutal.
22966 Hide the children.
22967 If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba.
22968 That is, until you start eating.
22969 Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.
22970 Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.
22971 The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.
22972 The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the "other" place.
22973 On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.
22974 And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.
22975 But not these.
22976 About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.
22977 If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.
22978 Pretty much explains it all.
22979 Avoid at all costs.
22980 Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero.
22981 Having spent lots of time in Sonora, Mexico over the years visiting family, I have always sought a place here in Arizona that provides an honest and quality duplication of the food I have had south of the border.
22982 At Sonora Mesquite Grill, I have found such a place that makes food on the spot, using only fresh ingredients, and genuine care for your experience.
22983 You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster, maybe have a plasma TV in your face, but I'm willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave.
22984 Celina, the kind and welcoming owner, wants people to receive the absolute best food possible.
22985 This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire.
22986 No, there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners.
22987 Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat.
22988 Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone?
22989 Perhaps not, but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic, modest, great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora.
22990 If going for the first time, make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas.
22991 Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill.
22992 Simple and great flavors at their very best.
22993 The food was absolutely delicious.
22994 Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix.
22995 We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab, Phnom Penh noodle soup, and the lehong noodles.
22996 All were delicious and very SE Asian.
22997 I could not believe how great the food was.
22998 But the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood.
22999 Can't wait to try the other dishes here.
23000 A definite must try here in Phoenix.
23001 I just got back from my first visit ti Jacks All In Social Club.
23002 I'll be go back.
23003 I found the place a nice place to play a hand or two of Texas Hold'em poker.
23004 The owners are nice couple want to provide a nice, clean, and safe place to play poker.
23005 They have succeed.
23006 When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later???
23007 This is exactly what I am doing about the "Arrogant Butcher."
23008 I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work.
23009 We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark.
23010 He truly made the experience AMAZING!
23011 His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears.
23012 You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.
23013 The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!
23014 Why doesn't every restaurant have these???
23015 The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING!
23016 We shared several desserts, one which was a peanut butter cup......stand back Reese's......you have competition now!!
23017 =)
23018 The manager came in later and had a professional, yet funny, manner about him as well.
23019 What a great team they are.
23020 Love love love this place!
23021 Great eats at this joint.
23022 New York strip was awesome!
23023 Pear salad was bomb and service was superb.
23024 I'll be back march 10th!
23025 The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds.
23026 The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike
23027 I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place.
23028 Apparently, one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called.
23029 We got a Baileys cupcake, a chocolate cupcake, and a carrot cupcake all of them were DELICIOUS!
23030 Seriously most gluten free pastries are horrible but these were great.
23031 We will definitely be going there frequently.
23032 Not being a big fan of chain restaurants, I wasnt super excited to eat here last night.
23033 I was however, starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuel's.
23034 OMG I loved it!
23035 The salsa's (especially the hot!)
23036 the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!!
23037 I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuel's menu and there they were, just how I like them!
23038 SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards!
23039 JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating.
23040 It was so good though that I'm craving it again today.
23041 We will definitely be back!
23042 This is the only Ben and Jerrys that has successfully withheld the recession in AZ.
23043 This means that this is the only one left as well.
23044 Its located in a beautiful plaza called El Pedregal.
23045 They have live music on Sundays.
23046 I found out this information from the friendly owner who told about the history of the store since I asked him if their location was really the only one open in all of AZ.
23047 The location is very North Scottsdale.
23048 I am not sure how it does for business, it is far from commercial areas.
23049 On my drove over, I mostly noticed many well built homes.
23050 This is the only Ben and Jerrys left, and I strongly encourage those who enjoy this ice cream to go out and support their business.
23051 They had Kool Aid!
23052 i was so happy to see it :)
23053 The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it...
23054 yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isn't ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water
23055 If you're ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!
23056 !
23057 PIECE OF **** manager wouldn't put air conditioning on yesterday.
23058 It was 90.
23059 They just lost alot of business.
23060 Postino's is a great date restaurant.
23061 Especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special.
23062 You can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only $20.
23063 Major win.
23064 The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite, followed by the artichoke, brie and apple, and salmon and capers.
23065 The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice.
23066 If you join their mailing list, you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurant's birthday.
23067 I also love their sea salt caramel sunday - it's the most delicious dessert ever.
23068 You have to try this place.
23069 It's just great.
23070 This is my current first choice in eateries.
23071 The spring rolls are made with rice paper and such an array of fresh bite sized vegetables, it melts in your mouth, and there are so many different kinds, ave price 3-4.00.
23072 Did I say they are HUGE?
23073 It's a weight watchers dream.
23074 Everything on the menu that we have tried has been delicious and presented beautifully.
23075 The sauces accompanying each dish are always intrigueing and tasty as all get out.
23076 The best thing of all, though, is the Ginger Creme Brule.
23077 Wow, sir.
23078 It doesnt get better than that.
23079 If you like Viet food, Thai food, or just plain fresh, good food, then this Vietnamese restaraunt should pique your interest.
23080 My goal is to try everything on the menu.
23081 This wasn't the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.
23082 All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.
23083 Not only the food, but the service.
23084 Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.
23085 I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious.
23086 I cleaned the plate.
23087 Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.
23088 The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right.
23089 The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.
23090 Dad cleaned the plate.
23091 From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.
23092 Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.
23093 When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.
23094 Not here.
23095 Everything was the way it should be.
23096 I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.
23097 Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.
23098 But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.
23099 Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.
23100 I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.
23101 Gratzi and Buon Natale.
23102 Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try.
23103 Deceptively fantastic.
23104 Like Lady Gaga.
23105 Pizza A Metro is the Lady Gaga of mid-range Italian restaurants.
23106 It's so unassuming from the outside that I was pumped when pulling up.
23107 Oh, man, Ben, we could get in a knife fight at a location like this!
23108 Sweeet!
23109 It's not that bad.
23110 But the food is righteous.
23111 The pre-meal bread with the tomato + balsamic + red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil.
23112 We split the antipasti (yes, the portions are comically large... we maybe cleared a layer (a delicious, delicious layer) of very fresh, yummy artichoke hearts, prosciutto wrapped canteloupe, and a smattering of other favorites.
23113 We then had the pizza with sausage and broccoli.
23114 Perfect cheese, perfect crust, yum sausage, perfectly crunchy fresh broccoli.
23115 It's clean and warm on the inside.
23116 Try it.
23117 You like it.
23118 And tell no one that I mentioned liking Lady Gaga.
23119 Hate long lines at the DMV?
23120 Hate dealing with the DMV for any reason?
23121 Then you should check out Desert Title Service.
23122 I had a complicated Title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the DMV office the last day of the month but I knew I had to do it.
23123 So today my daughter and I went over to DMV and waited an hour before deciding to call Desert Title Service.
23124 Had I known I could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer I would have checked them out sooner.
23125 I called their office while sitting in the DMV and drove over.
23126 In less then 15 minutes I had the title released and the title transferred.
23127 Daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5.
23128 If you need anything to do with your car I urge you to call them and/or visit their office.
23129 You will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is.
23130 I will never visit the DMV unless I have to.
23131 If we were able to give 0 stars...
23132 I would ask to give -1.
23133 I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.
23134 Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.
23135 They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.
23136 *Disgusting.
23137 The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.
23138 Possibly way before the barista started her shift.
23139 *Gross
23140 And finally.
23141 The milk.
23142 She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.
23143 This was a huge red flag.
23144 Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.
23145 Well, both were accomplished.
23146 The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.
23147 And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use.
23148 Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.
23149 I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.
23150 Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.
23151 AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.
23152 If you own a coffeeshop.
23153 Coffee should be your passion.
23154 If you own a bait shop.
23155 Fishing should be your passion.
23156 If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.
23157 Never going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday.
23158 So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it!!!
23159 BEST red kool-aid ever served in jars!!
23160 BEST waffles I've EVER had!!
23161 BEST red velvet cake I've EVER had!!
23162 I also did enjoy their chicken, mac & cheese and collard greens, but none were the best I've ever had, but very good.
23163 I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake, I don't know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but it's absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup, but who'd want to do that?
23164 the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist, the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness.
23165 I can not wait to indulge in this treat again, but since I'm far from being the only one who loves this place, it is always packed and the wait is long, at least on the weekend.
23166 Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Lo's run =P
23167 The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.
23168 I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals.
23169 It said "Regularly $140".
23170 What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100.
23171 However, we were charged tax on the full $140.
23172 Second, even though on the voucher it says "PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."
23173 (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.
23174 Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140.
23175 It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.
23176 Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.
23177 I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal "$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG.
23178 $165", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it.
23179 Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix.
23180 2.50 petite martinis after midnite; yes please!
23181 Love this place.
23182 Buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing.
23183 Love the atmosphere too!
23184 This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered.
23185 Second and last time I will be ordering from this place.
23186 The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time.
23187 Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add).
23188 11:54 comes and goes.
23189 Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind).
23190 Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM.
23191 They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM.
23192 My "hot sub" is ice cold, there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again.
23193 This place probably has a "good taste potential".
23194 Unfortunately, like most "hot food" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours.
23195 If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DON'T GET DELIVERY!
23196 This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.
23197 As Charlie Sheen would say "Winning!!!!"
23198 I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.
23199 The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.
23200 I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.
23201 Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.
23202 Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.
23203 I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.
23204 The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.
23205 I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.
23206 I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor
23207 Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.
23208 You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.
23209 Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.
23210 They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.
23211 After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.
23212 We always enjoy shopping at Von Hanson's.
23213 the owner was dishonest, she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic, and then charge higher pricing menu inside.
23214 she also charge me 12% sales tax, which is illegal in tempe, which suppose to be only 9.3% very rude manner, not recommended
23215 Only reason for 1 star is 'cause I got arrested here for underaged drinking years ago.
23216 I blame the Diamondbacks, for no legitimate reason.
23217 After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.
23218 I ordered the pho dac biet.
23219 The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.
23220 The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon.
23221 Puttanesco pizza (artichokes) was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient..
23222 They even have gluten free pizza crust.
23223 Happy hr drink is 1.00 off all drink choices which I love since I can order whatever I like
23224 What can I say about Execucar.
23225 I love their service.
23226 It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me.
23227 I make a reservation on-line, get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation.
23228 The cars are always nice, clean, and fresh smelling (yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA!)
23229 The drivers are always in shirts, ties, and slacks and they are professional and courteous.
23230 I have never had a driver be late (knock on wood) and they have always gotten me to the airport on-time.
23231 Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them.
23232 Can we say bonus!
23233 Since I have ranted recently on poor customer service, and in the spirit of balance, here is a shining example of how easy it really is.
23234 Late last summer  I came home and was shocked to see two of my sunscreens looking quite vandalized.
23235 Upon further inspection, it appeared that while using a back mounted leaf blower, one of the landscape crew had brushed against them.
23236 The exhaust pipe must have ripped and burned the screen material as well.
23237 It was quite the nasty burned melted scar.
23238  After staring at it for several hours, I realized there was no virgin Mary, no Jesus, hell it just looked like burned grilled cheese without any deity or lesser apparitions whatsoever, regardless of the angle or my squint.
23239 So deciding there was no money to made on eBay, I set out to get them repaired.
23240 Did some online searching and decided to call AmeriZona.
23241 I explained the situation and was told they could repair them, but I would have to bring them in.
23242 These are some pretty large sun screens mind you and packing them into the convertible would have been a challenge.
23243 While pondering what to do the person helping me on the phone asked me if I could hold on.
23244 I could tell it was one of those thinking on your feet light bulb went off type can you hold requests.
23245 She came back on the phone, informed me that she had a crew that was working close by and that she would ask one of the crew to swing by and pick up the screens for repair.
23246 She could not promise when they would be repaired, but for that convenience alone I was on board.
23247 She had already quoted me the price to repair the screens, and it was very reasonable considering some other online comparisons.
23248 Someone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens.
23249 He could not have been more accommodating, and it was obvious this guy had been working all day and was on his way home.
23250 A few days later, Mark  phoned me to tell me my screens were ready and to tell me he was going to drop them off on his way home!
23251 Needless to say Mark was also very pleasant to deal with.
23252 I believe he was at the time the sales manager.
23253 When he arrived, the screens looked great, matched the color of the others, even with the sun bleaching over several years.
23254 He even offered to put them in!
23255 This experience was way beyond any customer service expectations.
23256 No extra charges for any of the above and beyond the call of duty efforts.
23257 Outstanding, and quite refreshing.
23258 They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it.
23259 I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding).
23260 Old school steak house.
23261 Best 22oz ribeye I've had in years.
23262 Bread drenched in broth was curiously delicous.
23263 Waitstaff hustled.
23264 THe only aspect was the salad, a waste but at Durants, there is so much good meat, why waste it on vegiies!
23265 Get your passport, we're going to Mexico.
23266 Can't find your passport?
23267 Still waiting for it from the State Department?
23268 No worries, pack your bag and head to the Ranch Market!
23269 This place is the best!
23270 The food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes.
23271 And the produce department is crazy!
23272 2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents, 8 cucumbers for a dollar, 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro, 7 -- YES, SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents.
23273 You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank.
23274 The tamales are huge and the tortillas, oh the tortillas.
23275 Don't be frightened, don't get intimidated, it's just a grocery store people!
23276 This place is the best!
23277 They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky!
23278 they do have them call before you go!
23279 Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside.
23280 Take away only.They also have another location!!!
23281 Yea!
23282 In a strip mall on 51 ave & orangewood.
23283 They do serve "tacos" at this location!
23284 I came here today for a manicure and pedicure...
23285 I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.
23286 Although today I was solo:(.
23287 The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.
23288 Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!
23289 I was out of there in a hour.
23290 They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.
23291 Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.
23292 I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.
23293 Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.
23294 Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.
23295 Wow!
23296 I enjoyed staying here!
23297 Huge rooms!
23298 We had three adults and two children and everyone had plenty of room!
23299 Highly recommended!
23300 I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area.
23301 I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here.
23302 The staff is very cute and helpful.
23303 The people in the shop remind me of the bay area.
23304 I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth.
23305 The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.
23306 I strongly recommend this cafe!!
23307 !
23308 Donkey-
23309 Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.
23310 If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.
23311 Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
23312 This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.
23313 I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner.
23314 I received the show only because it was from an outside source.
23315 The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served.
23316 They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of.
23317 Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table.
23318 The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food.
23319 The people who did get food complained that it was terrible.
23320 Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food.
23321 When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it.
23322 The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying "f---k those people no more orders!
23323 not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back.
23324 We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 .
23325 Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life.
23326 Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund?
23327 unbelievable
23328 I LOVE this bar.
23329 My first visit was in 2004 when it was known as Bar Nun.
23330 I'd just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name.
23331 Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair.
23332 Since I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar.
23333 The staff was friendly and so were the patrons.
23334 Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety.
23335 As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!
23336 The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like.
23337 I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich.
23338 And the wings.
23339 They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus.
23340 In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.
23341 Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band.
23342 Usually classic rock or 80s stuff.
23343 They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.
23344 I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance.
23345 Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off.
23346 That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.
23347 Wow, I kinda wanna move back now.
23348 CK's I miss you!!
23349 !
23350 Thank God there were some Mesa firemen standing outside this place when I pulled up as my wife was very uneasy about exiting our car and heading in.
23351 Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it, did not ease her fears.
23352 After a unanimous "Defnitely, it's awesome!"
23353 amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my "Is this place worth going to?
23354 ", we parked the car and walked on in.
23355 This place is a definite hole in the wall (read: DUMP) and I/we LOVED it!
23356 Great chicken tacos, awesome machaca (shredded beef) burros, delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular (homemade of course).
23357 It's located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix, due west of the airport, but it's totally worth going to.
23358 It has become my new "first stop" after I get off the plane at Sky Harbor.....unless I land too late at night....
23359 Have been here twice.
23360 Everything is excellent as far as food quality.
23361 It's pretty busy on most evenings and that can slow things down so if you think you might be in a hurry I would recommend something else.
23362 Service has been outstanding each time that I have been.
23363 The food is good and they have a reasonably diverse wine lists with mostly national wine offerings.
23364 The prime rib is superb.
23365 Most meals will cost in the range of 15-30 dollars depending on pairings and w/o drinks.
23366 Definitely worth it for a nice night out.
23367 Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?
23368 Great place for a "home office" morning.
23369 One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating.
23370 Always busy - they offer breakfast & lunch, their food is awesome!
23371 Very generous portions.
23372 Best gyro in town!
23373 We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often.
23374 I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed.
23375 Service is great and they always take good care of us.
23376 This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to.
23377 I was up-charged for something I didn't order.
23378 When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face.
23379 Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile.
23380 He took my change, receipt and food.
23381 After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible, too much paperwork.
23382 Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him.
23383 Right.
23384 I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number.
23385 I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake.
23386 Not sure what could have been done to it.
23387 The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue.
23388 I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, he's the owner and CEO of the company.
23389 I highly doubt that.
23390 I love scallops, and the scallops at The Breadfruit were simply the best.
23391 On the weekend, The Breadfruit is open till 11pm and its Rum Bar is open till midnight, which makes this a great late-night haunt: pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening.
23392 The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily, offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes.
23393 The Breadfruit is located at 108 East Pierce, which is south of Roosevelt and just east of First Street.
23394 Put this place as a must on your late-night hit list.
23395 This place hits everything on my "it's Awesome" list.
23396 First off it's a family run little place.
23397 Second it's in a hole in the wall area.
23398 Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house.
23399 Fourtherly it is awesome
23400 We were in Gilbert staying at a friend's house for spring training, GO DODGERS!!!
23401 We hit the usuals, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts, Dodger Dogs at the game, and our friends asked do you like sandwiches?
23402 If there is one food group that I love, it has to be the Sandwich group, and
23403 this place is one of my top 5 sandwiches stops of all time.
23404 We ate in the Lounge(y)(ie) area, which has a more adult vibe going on.
23405 We first started with their fresh bread, and tomato basalmic vinegar salsa(y) thing.
23406 Which was great, we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages, and waited on our sandwiches.
23407 I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad, and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich, with pasta salad.
23408 My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork.
23409 I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes.
23410 While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me.
23411 Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me.
23412 This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on.
23413 After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting.
23414 The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream.
23415 Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect.
23416 In fact I am planning another trip out that way, just for that ice cream.
23417 My husband and I chose Binkleys for our 5th anniversary dinner.
23418 We don't usually spend that much on a meal, but for a special occasion we decided to splurge, and we are soooo glad we did.
23419 We decided to do the 4 course tasting meal, and with the many amuse bouche's throughout the meal we left so full, I couldn't even finish my wonderful seared foie gras.
23420 The atmosphere was cosy and inviting, the wait staff friendly and helpful.
23421 The three hours we spent enjoying our meal was well spent.
23422 We would both like to revisit and enjoy another taste adventure with this lovely resturant.
23423 They have a mechanical bull.
23424 Need I say more?
23425 Probably the most serious restaurant for food in Scottsdale.
23426 Great attention to detail from the chefs, management and servers.
23427 Shin does warm up after a few visits - we've been there probably 10 times in the last 18 months.
23428 ShinBay is a must for anyone truly into food.
23429 Given the ingredients - both the sheer number of them and the overall quality I would actually call the pricing here a downright bargain.
23430 I've been a patient of PFD for a few years, recommended by a friend, and have always been happy with the attention I've gotten.
23431 I actually go to the Gilbert location now, but I have been to the Tempe office once and had a good experience there.
23432 It's a family owned business, I think they've been around for 30 years.
23433 They have always been pleasant and honest when talking teeth.
23434 I wanted to mention my hygienist specifically, Jackie.
23435 She is super nice, calm and gentle, which is important to me since I don't particularly like going to the dentist.
23436 Check them out if you're in the market for a dentist.
23437 i love the army, but they make me wake up wicked early.
23438 then i work, work, work and when lunch rolls around, me want tasty goodness FAST.
23439 mamma mia's is the solution.
23440 i got their 2 slice deal, mushrooms.
23441 this cost me $4...that alone makes it rockstar, but you have to ask yourself...does it get any better?!
23442 oh yes, it does!!!
23443 the crust was crunchy, the cheese ooey-gooey and the mushrooms PLENTIFUL, which made me disgustingly happy.
23444 i think pizza places never put enuf mushrooms...today, i met my match.
23445 the joint is hoppin, but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes.
23446 plus, you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait (young, cute blue eyes, not the older, less attractive version) and listen to the tv blaring.
23447 and if you are me, the QUEEN of movie trivia, you enjoy your wait as a time to school co-workers in "the Game" while you wait for your AWESOME slices.
23448 moral of the story, go, young ones and enjoy.
23449 the food is plentiful and cheap, atmosphere friendly but small.
23450 its easy to miss...KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!!
23451 !
23452 Great Great Great salon!!
23453 They offer all sorts of services and Karyn, one of the nail techs is amazing!
23454 I'm a little obsessive with perfection when it comes to my nails and she does an absolute perfect job!
23455 Pays so much attention to detail!
23456 She is always creative and can make designs if you wish.
23457 She has many many color options.
23458 I would recommend EVERYONE to her and this salon!!
23459 Plus they won Best Salon in the East Valley!
23460 The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets.
23461 Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip.
23462 I hope I spelled his name correctly, he's just wonderful.
23463 He's very patient and very kind with my Sushi-poo and I'm comfortable leaving him in Chip's hands.
23464 Been here a few times, and each time it it's the best Thai food I have had in Az.
23465 Service has been consistently great.
23466 Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait.
23467 Lots of mid day food and drink specials.
23468 I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent.
23469 Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants I've tried in the east valley, while menu prices are below the average.
23470 I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back.
23471 I'm convinced that anyone giving this airline more than one star is most likely associated with them and is concerned about their job.
23472 I've been flying with them for 7 years back to NC to see my aging mother.
23473 I fly 3X/year on the same flights.
23474 The service and attitude of the employees has been getting progressively worse.
23475 I am also a pilot (20) years and I understand the weather and air traffic control VERY well!
23476 This rant is not about operations, security or delays.
23477 It is about the customer service by pissed off employees.
23478 My wife said that if she was not with me on my last trip she would not have believed what happened.
23479 I forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in Charlotte.
23480 The beverage service was 2 hours into the flight!
23481 This old, cranky b#$%^ came by and said, "what do you want?"
23482 I said I would like to have a soda and a water.
23483 She said you can only have one or the other.
23484 I was so thirsty I asked for the water.
23485 It was a very small glass that I drank very fast and then ask for a refill...please!
23486 She said, "I told you that you could only have one"  and pushed the cart away.
23487 Even the people around me were in shock.
23488 The check in personal were equally as rude.
23489 If you are watching the internet news, there was an article a few weeks back that rated customer satisfaction and US Airways was at the bottom!
23490 I for one will never fly with them again.
23491 i've been eating at bison witches for 7 years now.
23492 i started in tucson when i went to UA, and even though this one is on ASUs campus, i'll go because the food is that good.
23493 i almost always get the soup and sandwhich combo - the sundevil (in tucson its the wildcat) and the cream of brocolli soup.
23494 yummm!!
23495 they give you plenty of soup in a bread bowl, and if you're like me and like to dip, they give you the top of the bread bowl that they cut off.
23496 they also give you the insides of the bread bowl too!
23497 as everyone else has said, the sandwhiches are huge!!
23498 you could order just half a sandwhich and be good, but you would be missing out on some deliciousness.
23499 and you get all this food for just $7.75 (when i first started eating here, it was only $6.50, which was perfect for the poor college kid).
23500 i've also had their chicken cheese nachos, which is a cafeteria tray filled with tortilla chips, covered in lettuce, tomatoes, queso and cubes of chicken.
23501 it's an appetizer, but could definitely serve as a meal for 2.
23502 also tasty their chili and chili con queso.
23503 yummm....
23504 Best Subway anywhere.
23505 Super-friendly staff and always really clean!
23506 Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving.
23507 Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager).
23508 What a disappointing holiday.
23509 I have visited a few nail spas in Scottsdale and I like this one the best.
23510 ;)  They do the best work and they don't rush.
23511 The environment is clean and well decorated.
23512 They don't try to pressure you to get little designs on your nails.
23513 (At least, from my experience).
23514 If you want to chat, they'll chat.
23515 If you want to zone out and enjoy your pedicure, they'll let you.
23516 Just try to book your appointment in advance.
23517 They have availability for walk-ins sometimes, but your best bet is to secure your own spot.
23518 I have been to a great many Ross store-- and I can safely say that this one is my favorite.
23519 Even when it is busy, it is still manageable, unlike some of the others.
23520 I am also consistently pleased with their selection.
23521 Now, I often go in there without much of a purpose, just to see what's there-- but I recently found ALL, that's right, all of my Christmas gifts.
23522 Perhaps I went in on a lucky day, but I can't think of a time when I didn't walk out of there with at least something.
23523 I was sorry to read the previous review, because I have had such a consistently good time at this store.
23524 As for the store having a security guard, the one who works most of the time is a kick in the pants.
23525 He'll chat with you if given the opportunity.
23526 Also, every Ross has at least one, if not two, security guards working while the store is open.
23527 I hope more of you are encouraged to visit now that you know what a great time I have had there.
23528 It's one of the smaller Ross stores that I have been in, but it certainly packs a punch.
23529 Happy bargaining!
23530 The closest thing I have to a neighborhood pub.
23531 Not bad.
23532 They sell loads of Belgian and Canadian beer.
23533 That is all that you need to know.
23534 Saw CAKE there last year.
23535 Nice grass, beautiful venue, great night!
23536 I really adore this place.
23537 They've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy.
23538 I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork.
23539 Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly.
23540 Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant.
23541 Do yourself the favor.
23542 If you're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal.
23543 They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli.
23544 Mmmm!
23545 I LOVE BURRITO EXPRESS.
23546 My fiance has been going with his friends since they were in high school and he finally took me to try the only thing his group ever orders: a steak, potato and cheese burrito.
23547 EPIC.
23548 This burrito was so awesome that they have never tried anything else on the menu and I feel the exact same way.
23549 The tortilla is huge and fresh and the burrito itself is gigantic.
23550 I can never finish mine but the boys seem to eat it right up!
23551 Don't leave this place without trying the horchata either, it's so good.
23552 I've been to other Mexican places like this and the horchata tasted like gross water.
23553 Burrito Express however does it right and I will always go back to this place whenever I'm up for the BEST BURRITO EVER.
23554 This is probably one of the more unique, trendy looking places in Phoenix-metro to lounge at.
23555 Everything about AZ88 is eye-candy, literally., from the furniture to the drinks to the decor and of course, the patrons.
23556 Drinks are made really, really tasty.
23557 My usual choice of cocktail is the French 75.
23558 My go-to appetizer is either the waffle fries that comes with three flavorful dipping sauces or the shrimp ceviche!
23559 The menu is pretty diverse with a little flair.
23560 What makes this place a hit for me are the contemporary, artsy decor making it a refreshing scene to come to compared to other Phoenix-ish ambiance.
23561 Of course, you can't have all these modern, sophisticated attributes without a DJ playing fresh beats and sounds!
23562 Bottom line is the look and the vibe makes me feel like I am back in New York or Los Angeles.
23563 I had given a 4-star prior, but I can honestly say AZ88 can hang with the big boys.
23564 Fantastic place to learn Krav Maga and workout.
23565 My two sons have been going to React Defense Systems, RDS, for years and they finally convinced me to go.
23566 I love it and it's too bad I didn't go earlier!
23567 The instructors and facility are top notch.
23568 As a beginner, the instructors made me feel welcome and motivated even though my skills were untrained.
23569 After two weeks, I can feel, see, and hear the difference.
23570 I love smacking the bag with sweaty fists and feet and seeing the sweat fly.
23571 If you are looking for intense conditioning, then RDS is the place.
23572 If you are looking for life saving skills, then RDS is still the place.
23573 Learn a great life skill, become fitter, and have fun.
23574 I agree with AZ Central: RDS is the best boxing/martial art facility in Arizona.
23575 In closing, I'd recommend RDS to anyone and I apologize to everyone for not being creative enough to think of something funny or flippant.
23576 Oh did I mention this is one of the few places in the world where parents and their kids can legally beat on each other and enjoy it?!
23577 When was the last time your son hit you?
23578 ;-)
23579 What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband.
23580 The store is filled, ceiling to floor, with all varieties of toys for all age groups.
23581 Shelves upon shelves of brands and models you've likely never seen if your main toy-shopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart.
23582 The store's management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store -- toys are sprawled across the store,  ready for the next child's little hands.
23583 Yet, it didn't feel messy in there.
23584 The aisles are wide and smooth.
23585 The store is organized into various zones.
23586 (Dolls, science, blocks, books, baby, etc.)
23587 This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where you're always hard-pressed to find non-chain stores.
23588 My wife and I just got married at Blackstone, and I'm still amazed at how awesome they are to work with.
23589 Elizabeth, Megan, and Alicia all worked tirelessly to make our wedding memorable.
23590 The location couldn't have been better, I'm still getting compliments on how beautiful it was.
23591 We read the glowing reviews prior to booking, and all I can say is that I agree with them 100%.
23592 Awesome pool.
23593 Don't bother with this place.
23594 I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.
23595 We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.
23596 When we got home the order was totally wrong.
23597 Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.
23598 The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.
23599 I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.
23600 Never going back, such a complete disappointment.
23601 Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again.
23602 I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO.
23603 It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it.
23604 The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!
23605 I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town.
23606 I have no idea why people go to Subway.
23607 Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it.
23608 Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for.
23609 The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working.
23610 $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better!
23611 They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods.
23612 I discovered this place by going on one of my usual 20 mile bike rides along the canal until something cool popped up.
23613 I sat outside and sipped a nice chamomile tea as the first rain of winter fell unleashing an amazing scent.
23614 The staff was top notch and I was delighted to see several tannat wines from Uruguay on the menu.
23615 I can't wait to return some evening to share a bottle of wine and tapas with my girlfriend.
23616 Awesome staff.
23617 Great prices.
23618 Left feeling relaxed and refreshed.
23619 A must try.
23620 yuk!
23621 service and food sucked never a
23622 gain!
23623 I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night.
23624 Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival.
23625 Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade.
23626 However, this is where the pleasanties end.
23627 Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes.
23628 No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers.
23629 When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.
23630 The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later.
23631 Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita.
23632 We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed.
23633 The entire duration of dinner, it never came.
23634 Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.
23635 An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches.
23636 I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour.
23637 Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served.
23638 The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.
23639 Slightly expensive, I can see as justified.
23640 But many agree that time is worth much more than money.
23641 I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night.
23642 Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off.
23643 I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.
23644 I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH).
23645 A++
23646 Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee.
23647 I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!)
23648 with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads I've ever had!
23649 I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side.
23650 I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.
23651 This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too!
23652 One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.
23653 We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I can't take another lunch with her on my lap:)
23654 I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible.
23655 I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family.
23656 The more we go, service decreased.
23657 Our water cups never get filled.
23658 The very last time I was there, I found a gnat in my pho.
23659 Although I have eaten about 50% of the medicore pho, they asked if I wanted another bowl.
23660 I said no; I was there on my lunch break.
23661 No time to wait for another bowl.
23662 I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation.
23663 I am disappointed with them and will not be back.
23664 We have been eating here for years.
23665 I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food).
23666 I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesday's, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days.
23667 The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc.
23668 Highly suggest.
23669 There are a lot of places to visit on Mill Avenue .
23670 .
23671 .
23672 however, there is no place like Fat Tuesday!
23673 When we visit Tempe, we always make it a point to stop at "Fats".
23674 We have always visited before the night time crowd comes.
23675 When we walk in the door, the bartenders remember us, suggest yummy drinks, ask about us .
23676 .
23677 .
23678 treat us like we are special.
23679 We have struck up many conversations with other patrons who enjoy going to Fat Tuesdays as much as we do.
23680 During the day it''s a great place to just get out of the heat, cool off with their daquiris and eat a delicious Po Boy.
23681 Jason is our favorite bartender .
23682 .
23683 .
23684 and we have lots of laughs with him!
23685 I am counting the days until weI will be back in AZ to go to Fat Tuesday!
23686 When I was a dancer I always came here for everything.
23687 Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories.
23688 They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want.
23689 I'm not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio.
23690 The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing.
23691 Dance shoes can get confusing!
23692 There are at least three different kind of tap shoes!
23693 Dee's also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dee's can help you out with that too!
23694 Thank you Yelp...
23695 I only wish i had six Stars... Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars...
23696 This place is THAT good!
23697 I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for 'third wave coffee' (those who know what I mean by this will just know... everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again) while I was traveling in Tempe.
23698 I don't 'like' coffee, I LOVE it (insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here)...
23699 I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z11 and pride myself on my espresso skills.
23700 Simply put, I will never pull a shot like i had here.
23701 Off the chart awesome!
23702 So that's the first 5 Stars...the Sixth star??
23703 I just can't believe they have GOOD pastry too!
23704 I understand they produce in-house and if that's true then it's completely astounding.
23705 Easily the best croissant I've had outside of Paris.
23706 Run, don't walk to the Coffee Lab; it is worth the flight to Tempe.
23707 If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new - this is the place.
23708 Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it.
23709 We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing ... again ...
23710 I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them.
23711 That is the main reason I went back - I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out.
23712 I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it ... the tint was perfect.
23713 They use only the top quality film, and do quality work.
23714 I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long!
23715 If you are looking for a detail job, or window tint, this is the ONLY place you should be looking!
23716 Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done..
23717 I'm a complete dive bar junkie.
23718 Whether I'm in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots.
23719 I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants.
23720 After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away.
23721 It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge!
23722 The bartender was very attentive and adorable.
23723  I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals.
23724 Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time.
23725 Great bar!
23726 The perfect burger.
23727 Awesome BBQ!
23728 NEVER a bad meal!
23729 Why'd the chicken cross the road?
23730 To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!
23731 I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work.
23732 Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it.
23733 While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)
23734 During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right.
23735 It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way!
23736 Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness.
23737 Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too.
23738 Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.
23739 This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes.
23740 Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food.
23741 Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's.
23742 This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!
23743 This place rocks!!
23744 We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing.
23745 They helped us every step of the way.
23746 We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable.
23747 I will absolutely go back when we re-do the floors in the rest of the house.
23748 And the prices are the best.
23749 I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project.
23750 I researched prices all over... online, in stores, with contractors, etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices.
23751 The entire floor cost less than $1500 in tile, materials, and tools.
23752 It looks beautiful and I couldn't be happier!
23753 How have I NOT reviewed Four Peaks yet?
23754 !
23755 Awesome.
23756 Even when its wall to wall packed.
23757 Even after waiting in a 2 hour line for the special St. Paddy's day breakfast and festivities.
23758 The beers are great.
23759 the food is oh so good.
23760 you really cant go wrong w/ anything that includes their beer bread.
23761 And their breakfast!
23762 If you can brave the crowd that comes out for it, seriously do it.
23763 One of the best breakfasts in town.
23764 Ive had almost every item on their brunch menu, and I cant think of one that disappointed.
23765 GO.
23766 i moved to the tempe area about 2 weeks ago from socal, the mecca for asian restaurants.
23767 since moving out here, my only taste for asian food has been panda express.
23768 well, i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here.
23769 tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out.
23770 as soon as i walked in the door, i was greeted by the old man...from across the joint, behind the counter, mind you.
23771 he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny!
23772 checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming!
23773 they have every teriyaki dish available, and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices, and for those that like rabbit food, vegetable dishes.
23774 i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menu...was bummed out about that.
23775 i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah W.'s review of the house chicken, so i went with that.
23776 i went with a large order and let me tell you; if you're hungry, you definitely will be stuffed after a large order.
23777 the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom.
23778 i love mushroom!
23779 the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick, it wasn't the "spicy" i was used to from asian joints in socal.
23780 i wish it had a bit more rice, though.
23781 either way, the dish was great!
23782 i would definitely order it again!
23783 i highly recommend this joint.
23784 you will be treated well by the cool old man behind the counter, the place is clean, the servings are generous and the  price is cheap!
23785 As many other people have said in other reviews, Betito's is similar to Filibertos.
23786 However, I thought Betitos tasted a little better.
23787 The food was less greasy than Filibertos.
23788 My family had Carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, a chicken chimichanga, and the super nachos.
23789 They all tasted excellent.
23790 My favorite was the carnitas burrito.
23791 Now, Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
23792 I haven't tried their tacos yet, but I intend to try them in the future.
23793 I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!
23794 Food and service are equally good.
23795 Fries are to die for.
23796 great pho , boba :) and vermicelli .. awesome !
23797 Their Alfredo the Dark is probably the best pasta dish in Phx.
23798 And then there's the Pazookie...
23799 Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult 1 1/2 mile hike (Just up, 3 miles total) that I have ever been on.
23800 While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half.
23801 The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking.
23802 You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at:
23803 http://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.png
23804 The walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-25 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else.
23805 The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment.
23806 There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike.
23807 The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is.
23808 There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time.
23809 This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.
23810 The rest at the top is wonderful.
23811 The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone.
23812 Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit.
23813 The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long.
23814 Be careful on the way back.
23815 It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon.
23816 Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.
23817 Don't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside.
23818 When my youngest son graduated I took him to Buzz Boys when they were in the Food City complex.
23819 He is now 25 and still goes.
23820 I gave a family friend a gift certificate for Fathers day.
23821 He still goes and so does his 30 yr old son.
23822 My oldest son is out of the Army and he started going.
23823 These men compare this to a spa for men.
23824 Hot towels, straight razor shave, etc.
23825 Hey I should get commission lol:)
23826 The worst Thai food I've ever had!
23827 This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!
23828 Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...
23829 don't bother with this place.
23830 Went there for a quick bite before the theater.
23831 Had the buffalo sloppy joes, and they were disgusting--dry buns, thin sliced pickle.
23832 Then had the duck spring rolls--also bad.
23833 Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate, ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp, and they were just adquate.
23834 Very disappointing!
23835 I have been here many times and have always had good food and service.
23836 I heart Rome's Pizza!!
23837 Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza.
23838 I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right.
23839 When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road.
23840 I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza).
23841 Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts?
23842 ?
23843 The food is always fresh.
23844 The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large.
23845 The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style).
23846 I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for.
23847 The man that owns it does most of the deliveries.
23848 When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street.
23849 Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him.
23850 He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house.
23851 I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?).
23852 But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem.
23853 How refreshing!
23854 In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!
23855 !
23856 Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American.
23857 Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist.
23858 I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson).
23859 I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions.
23860 There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland.
23861 The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup.
23862 I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it.
23863 He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year!
23864 After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.
23865 But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in.
23866 Needles to say I will not be returning.
23867 Jake's been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years.
23868 He's very trustworthy and fair.
23869 My new favorite place.
23870 I love this pizza.
23871 I became a vegetarian in March.
23872 So cheese pizza with mushrooms and olives is very important to me.
23873 And Mamma Mia's is cheap and delicious, my favorite combo.
23874 And my constant companion, my 9 year old daughter born in Philly and a fan of hoagies, loves their turkey subs.
23875 I'm just in it for the pizza.
23876 And if you sit outside you can watch the people going to the liquor store next door and watch the people playing frogger to get across the street to the Vig.
23877 Pretty good people watching.
23878 I will never make another purchase from this company ever again!
23879 The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items.
23880 After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items.
23881 I cannot recommend this to anyone.
23882 So.......I love Defalco's.
23883 My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista, which is JUST PERFECTION, with and without the prosciutto.
23884 I've had someone describe their service to me as "New York style" and I agree with that assessment, so if you cant hang with it, then go be a baby somewhere else.
23885 The food is fresh, delicious, and incredible.
23886 Their lattes are bomb, and the cannolis pretty great too.
23887 I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food.
23888 Just your typical warehouse club right?
23889 I guess that depends on your definition of typical.
23890 Sam's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am.
23891 You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you.
23892 All you do is go in a pay for it.
23893 They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.
23894 The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.
23895 They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card.
23896 In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know "clearance" section at each Sam's.
23897 You just have to know where it is.
23898 Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a "1".
23899 Most common is .71 or .81.
23900 I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret.
23901 They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.
23902 They also will give cookies to children.
23903 My boys also love the cafe where they get their "pizza and drink please."
23904 Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.
23905 Prices are very reasonable though.
23906 They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!
23907 If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.
23908 Their refund policy is really good as well.
23909 I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!
23910 Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.
23911 They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.
23912 Mm!
23913 I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.
23914 That smell is unforgettable.
23915 I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.
23916 The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.
23917 The caramel apple martini is the best!!!
23918 Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!
23919 They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!
23920 For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.
23921 (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)
23922 This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.
23923 The dcor is pretty rad too.
23924 The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate...
23925 Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State...
23926 Sure, it's a man-made water source, and yes - it's pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but it's gorgeous during the day and at night too!
23927 I've done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well...
23928 With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter what's going on there...
23929 My only words of wisdom - don't swallow the lake water!
23930 This place is so unbelievably cool.
23931 In a city desperate for arts, this is perfect!
23932 "Her Secret is Patience" is a bold statement for downtown, a sign of youth, renaissance, and complexity.
23933 It's serenity and over-looming stature make it something to admire.
23934 I wish more public spaces in the Valley were this awesome.
23935 It's worth checking out, even if it's not your taste in art, you've got to admit it's pretty interesting.
23936 Be sure to see at at night too!
23937 Lot's of beautiful colors accent the homogenized office buildings.
23938 :)
23939 I resisted eating Zoyo for months after they opened because I was afraid I'd get hooked and be there every day.
23940 And, yep, it's addictive.
23941 They always have new flavors to try, but right now my fave is salted caramel.
23942 It's incredible.
23943 I usually pass on toppings.
23944 As other have suggested, it'd be nice if they had smaller containers.
23945 But I am impressed that they can keep the store so clean with the giant roll-up doors open.
23946 They lead to a nice patio that's sufficiently removed from the street that you're not just breathing exhaust.
23947 Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.
23948 Love their drinks and raw food menu.
23949 Just wish their prices would come down bit.
23950 This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.
23951 I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.
23952 I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.
23953 Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.
23954 If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.
23955 Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.
23956 Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?
23957 Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.
23958 I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.
23959 Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.
23960 But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.
23961 Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try.
23962 ...The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted!!!
23963 Crab Wontons melt in your mouth!!!
23964 Excellent service... GO !!
23965 !
23966 Was I there on a bad day or what?
23967 I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.
23968 They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.
23969 Gross and bland.
23970 I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was.
23971 Yuck!
23972 being that i'm fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food.
23973 also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from.
23974 for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town.
23975 i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door.
23976 :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good.
23977 everything is like it should be.
23978 their spring rolls are pretty decent.
23979 what i really like is it doesn't pretend to be something it's not.
23980 it's a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are.
23981 the food is great and the service is quick.
23982 Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.
23983 Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!
23984 ), creative and authentic.
23985 I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!
23986 Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative.
23987 I can't say enough good things about this place.
23988 I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).
23989 This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.
23990 All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though.
23991 After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband.
23992 Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos.
23993 He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos.
23994 In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now can't get enough of them too.
23995 They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous.
23996 If you are looking for great food and you're not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further.
23997 We miss you Los Taquitos.....
23998 The Rusty Spur has the distinction of being the oldest cowboy bar in Arizona and a gen-u-ine registered historic landmark.
23999 It's even got a hitchin' post for yer horses out front.
24000 The Spur has been patronized by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood -- although never while I've been there.
24001 There's great live music four afternoons and six nights a week.
24002 Other good things include plenty of parking, no cover, and a fun venue to people-watch.
24003 veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty.
24004 I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front.
24005 I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
24006 Tommy V's is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious.
24007 The atmosphere matches the name - just oh, so chic!
24008 and the staff is always very gracious!
24009 We will return many times this summer with the new special app & entree deal too!
24010 When I set out to go to happy hour last week, I didn't expect Prince Edward Island Mussels and a most fantastic wine that our waiter recommended!
24011 Tommy V's has the recipe for success in good cuisine, wine, and ambiance!
24012 We love Niro's!
24013 The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite!
24014 The Greek salad is big and fresh.
24015 The gyros are also excellent.
24016 I'm a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix!
24017 Service is fast and prices are good.
24018 The owners are almost always there and make us feel so welcome!
24019 Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better ...
24020 The Capriotti food is heavy ... and it doesn't taste as good as you think it should taste
24021 On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea.
24022 Very cute store and great personable staff.
24023 Nice selection to baked goods and great taste.
24024 What nice find in the downtown area.
24025 I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown... North and South is covered for those sudden cravings... now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city.
24026 Great food as always.
24027 The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)
24028 The service is great.
24029 Homemade breads.
24030 Extremely generous portions.
24031 I would highly recommend this restaurant to all.
24032 Service is good...
24033 The newer waitors tend to forget you're there.
24034 Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning...
24035 Cheesecake is magnificent...
24036 The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!
24037 This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale.
24038 Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center.
24039 As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands.
24040 One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke & Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles.
24041 Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway.
24042 Ruby is always getting new stuff in so it's a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine.
24043 Two thumbs up!
24044 I'm ashamed that I haven't left a review for this place yet.
24045 I've eaten here for a good while and I've never been disappointed with the food.
24046 Well, there was this one time, but it was because it was sold out.
24047 I'm okay with that, it tells me it was really popular that night.
24048 Anyway...
24049 The prices are good, the teas are good, and it's just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt.
24050 Every friend I've brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal.
24051 I'm a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand island.
24052 You know what, look at the average review score.
24053 I really think that's the most telling part of this place.
24054 Really.
24055 Go.
24056 Eat.
24057 Enjoy.
24058 Delightful experience!
24059 I came in with my 2 little ones alone.
24060 Jay was our waiter, and a very good one.
24061 He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing, because I am highly allergic to mango.
24062 He was very accomodating.
24063 I also had the seared tuna tataki, which was also excellent.
24064 My kids had miso soup and their fried rice; both were very good.
24065 I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious.
24066 Thumbs up!
24067 !
24068 This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).
24069 The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.
24070 My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so don't be surprised if you eat something you like and it's not there next time.
24071 What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.
24072 I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.
24073 The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries.
24074 I can't wait to return.
24075 This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!
24076 The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there.
24077 First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious.
24078 Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot.
24079 My wife loved the fish tacos -- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is fantastic.
24080 You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it.
24081 theres a gun check upon entry.
24082 i often forget AZ is quite different than CA....
24083 my first and only experience at cabela's was on black friday.
24084 i honestly havent participated in black friday much in past yrs and questioned deals really being deals.
24085 but HELLO deals at cabela's.
24086 first of all, they gave away rifles to the first 800 people we were there on black friday.
24087 again, im not in cali anymore!
24088 this place is an outdoors lover dream.
24089 and on top of selection and discounted prices...its almost like an amusement park:
24090 aquarium room with freshwater fish, back natural history museum-eque taxidermy displays, heads of animals and maps of where they originate from hanging throughout the huge main room, a chocolate shop, and entire cafeteria.
24091 basically, you can make a day out of cabela's.
24092 we were there for 4 hours and i didn't even realize.
24093 but now lets talk about the deals....the deeeeaaallssss.
24094 "i could easily spend $1,000 in one trip here."
24095 - my guy, as we finally left the building.
24096 a stranger chuckled who overheard, "yeah, no kidding."
24097 the damage on my credit card was...

24115 thats not even the tip of the iceburg at this place.
24116 campers paradise, fishers paradise, hunter's paradise.
24117 also, single ladies...id say 80% of the customers in this place are always male so... ;)
24118 Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi.
24119 Sakana is hands down the best in town.
24120 The fish is fresh, the rolls are huge and nothing beats the .50 cent appetizers when you buy a beer!
24121 I recommend going on a weeknight, Friday and Saturday nights can fill up pretty quickly so you might have to wait.... but it's worth it.
24122 Wow.
24123 Wow Freakin' Wow.
24124 I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER.
24125 I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.
24126 I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York.
24127 She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie.
24128 We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink.
24129 It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka.
24130 Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice!
24131 And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.)
24132 Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones.
24133 I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is.
24134 It was very nice and relaxing.
24135 Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.
24136 When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table.
24137 She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy.
24138 We loved her.
24139 She reminded me of Joan Cusack.
24140 Sounded just like her!
24141 The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.
24142 We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls.
24143 I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex.
24144 The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled.
24145 Fabulous.
24146 But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off.
24147 I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment.
24148 I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.
24149 She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign.
24150 For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine.
24151 I re-live that moment over and over.
24152 MMM.
24153 But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come.
24154 I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me.
24155 It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon.
24156 The poor salmon!
24157 It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister.
24158 Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.
24159 Amy got the butterfish.
24160 We licked our plates clean.
24161 Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.
24162 For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle.
24163 How good was it??
24164 Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.
24165 Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing.
24166 The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like.
24167 I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum?
24168 (also very good)
24169 It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better?
24170 They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.
24171 Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through.
24172 The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???)
24173 (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)
24174 THUMBS WAY UP!!
24175 !
24176 I recently decided to accompany a couple friends on their quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix.
24177 A few weeks ago we started here at Yasu Sushi Bistro.
24178 While I'm not as committed to the quest as they are, I would be surprised if Yasu didn't rank among the top five sushi places in the Valley.
24179 We had an incredible dining experience at Yasu.
24180 Our server was perfect: she definitely knew sushi and had many great recommendations.
24181 I'm still somewhat of a sushi novice, but you don't have to be a pro to know when you're eating a fresh, creative meal.
24182 My recommendations: start off with miso soup with clams and try the hamachi carpaccio.
24183 At the end of the meal ask your server to have the chef make you something special.
24184 He made us tempura avocado wrapped in eel, topped with foie gras and served it to us personally.
24185 It was amazing.
24186 Yasu provided one of the best dining experiences I've had all year.
24187 I just thought I'd post an update.
24188 I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.
24189 I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.
24190 As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).
24191 My gag reflex is going off as I type this.
24192 My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food.
24193 My wife and I have a timeshare nearby and when we were doing a morning walk we saw this place and we asked our concierge she raved.
24194 We went and fell in love with the place.
24195 The service, the food, the friendship.
24196 We go back every time we are in town and the staff remembers you.
24197 Also my wife loves gnocchi and says that these are as good as her grandmother's.
24198                                    Dave A
24199 We had a bad experience in May with a person at Charleston's we thought to be a manager (see review).
24200 The next day my husband and brother-in-law contacted the restaurant manager, Chris, we had great and immediate communication with him and he encouraged us to give the restaurant another try as we had been happy there before.
24201 Recently, we had a large party of family members dine at the restaurant and the service and food was perfect.
24202 Chris made a point to check in with us at the table and at the end of the meal.
24203 Great job, Chris and team!
24204 We look forward to dining at Charleston's with you again soon.
24205 I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location.
24206 The staff looks miserable and are SLOW.
24207 The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back.
24208 Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean.
24209 The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy.
24210 Never again!
24211 My home airport and one of the nicest terminals in the USA!
24212 Great food, cool things to see and do, you just can't get bored here!
24213 no chip manicure: no drilling, no filing, no damage, no dry time!
24214 we offer over 100 colors form opi , shellac, gelish, Experienced Tech, Professional service and Satisfaction guaranteed.
24215 I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation.
24216 The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless.
24217 It took several months to get but it was worth it.
24218 This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer.
24219 This is our DEFAULT happy hour.
24220 I won't be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there.
24221 I'm not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like.
24222 And I've been told they have a martini specials, but you don't go to a beer place and get martinis... come on.
24223 Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?)
24224 is on the half price happy hour menu.
24225 You know what that means?
24226 Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars.
24227 (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack).
24228 In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words.
24229 Heck.
24230 Yes.
24231 Divine,  the Carne Asada was so tasty,  flavorful and tender.
24232 Everything we enjoyed tasted fresh and authentic.
24233 The guacamole was knock you socks off, traditional and limey, (I took my extra home and enjoyed the next day).
24234 I liked what the previous reviewer who said also that the beans and rice are not an afterthought here, they are also amazingly well executed.
24235 I am eager to get back an try the Chicken and Barbacoa as well as the roasted green chile cheese dip.
24236 If your in the area of 44th Street and Thomas, forgo the big chain of Chipotle and show this lovey Phoenix gem some love, your taste buds will not be disappointed.
24237 Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place.
24238 Food was average at best and thats being kind.
24239 Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.
24240 Just an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates.
24241 Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate.
24242 So we shall see.
24243 If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would.
24244 I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.
24245 Barely average fast food quality and taste.
24246 Avoid!
24247 I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning.
24248 Surprise, surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to.
24249 I'm pretty mad about this.
24250 I am new to Jamba, however i am surprised at the AMAZING customer service that this store dishes out.
24251 One of the workers there has always noticed me as a regular customer.
24252 He has a stellar personality, gave me a 20% off card and sometimes has my order ready by the time i finish paying the cashier.
24253 He's always very bright and smiling or laughing with his co-workers, I believe his name is Christian.
24254 He suggested a banana oatmeal with peanut butter the other morning and i have to say that it has been the most incredible oatmeal i have ever had!!!
24255 (You must try this) At times i visit the store twice a day simply because i cannot get enough Jamba Juice!
24256 !
24257 I stopped by here last night after the Suns game.
24258 It was cheap and fast.
24259 Also, it was by far the best carne asada I have ever tasted.
24260 It was tender and juicy, and not at all rubbery.
24261 I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery, but that was also from a 'bertos joint.
24262 I enjoyed the way this place is set up.
24263 Walk up to the counter, order and they bring you your food.
24264 It is quick and efficient.
24265 We got the dinner for 2, 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips and drinks for $20.
24266 The tacos were great, as were the burros.
24267 I will definitely be back.
24268 Oh the 5 stars are specifically for the quick, efficient service... and the BEST carne asada around.
24269 Great sports bar!
24270 Shows most UFC, Boxing and WWE pay per views.
24271 Friendly staff, good food....  draft beer selection could be a little better, but other than that, one of my favorite local pubs.
24272 good place to kill an evening.
24273 I used to spend my time here many moons ago.
24274 good coffee at good prices.
24275 Do you hate shaving as much as I do?
24276 Do you find waxing too painful and expensive every 6-8 weeks?
24277 Well I have the answer for you!!!
24278 Go see Cindy Semerdjian at Cosmetic Laser Solutions.
24279 I was introduced to Cindy through a friend AND NOW I AM HOOKED!!!
24280 Not only do I no longer have hair, it is very inexpensive!
24281 How much did it cost for you to get waxed...what would you say if I told you for a few dollars more the hair would be gone...PERMANENTLY!
24282 Cindy offers a free initial consultation.
24283 A few prices that I have experienced on a per session basis is: underarm - $100 ; bikini (brazilian) - $100; full leg (both) - $250.
24284 I highly, highly recommend going to see Cindy!
24285 Tell her Jillian sent you!
24286 So get started today to get ready for summer!
24287 This place is awesome they r going to replace a bad  tire for me for free that another discount tire put on they r awesome
24288 This is the pub burger you have been looking for.
24289 Nothing fancy, just a good solid burger with a ice cold beer.
24290 Be aware this is cash only, but unless you fall in you wont need much.
24291 Wow these folks know customer service!
24292 We like the fact there are always managers on the floor keeping things moving and tables clean.
24293 Food is good and at a good price point.
24294 A nice friendly well run place!
24295 This location is great and there grooming service is good as well.
24296 If you are looking for a good vet, you have to read this.
24297 If you are looking for a vet that is COMPETENT, a vet that REALLY CARES about animals and a vet that is INEXPENSIVE and reasonably priced, then you really have to check out Dr. Howard at Grayhawk Animal Hospital in North Scottsdale.
24298 He is worth the trip.
24299 I am so impressed by Dr. Howard and his EXCEPTIONAL STAFF.
24300 Every time we come here we leave satisfied beyond our expectations.
24301 Since my last review, we have used them two more times.
24302 Once when Spencer got neutered, and once when he had to have his nails trimmed.
24303 I have to say I am so very impressed.
24304 I was holding back on reviewing them again until I could be certain that it would be an accurate review and to be certain that they are consistent with their outstanding service and pricing.
24305 Well, I can say confidently now that they most certainly are.
24306 Spencer was neutered here some time ago with no complications and no outrageous fees.
24307 When he was done his procedure, I received a happy, completely alert dog back from them.
24308 His incision was minimal, the sutures were tight and he healed quickly.
24309 It was done so well that he did not even lick at the area.
24310 It was like nothing ever happened.
24311 More recently, Spencer needed his nails trimmed, and because he was a rescued dog from a very abusive situation, he does not trust people and has a phobia to anyone touching his tail or feet.
24312 It is so bad that when I try to nicely, calmly approach him to trim his nails, he urinates all over himself and hides for the rest of the day.
24313 Spencer was really abused and as a result, grooming is really difficult.
24314 Well, I discussed this with the doctor's office and we decided that sedation (unfortunately) was our only option.
24315 His nails were getting too long and painful and something needed to be done.
24316 Well, we just got him back from the office and they were so good about it that they did not even have to sedate him.
24317 I am impressed, but what I am more impressed with is that they first tried to trim his nails without using sedation and had his best interest in mind.
24318 They really care about the animals they treat.
24319 They could have sedated him.
24320 It would have been quicker and easier and more profitable for them, but they didn't.
24321 They really did not want to use a drug on him if they did not have to - and so they didn't.
24322 They trimmed his nails up well and did not even cut into the quick or make him bleed.
24323 He left there, again and as usual, a happy, well taken care of dog.
24324 And we left there ecstatic!
24325 The bill was so inexpensive and Spencer was taken care of so well - like he was their dog.
24326 I just can't say enough good things about this Veterinary Office.
24327 I think that everyone knows that good medical professionals are hard to find - for humans and/or animals.
24328 So often, they just don't care about the patient.
24329 Well, not here.
24330 It appears to be their top priority.
24331 Dr. Howard is a very happy, well educated man and it shows in his practice in every way - right down to all of the people he hires (they are all equally happy and competent!).
24332 You will not be disappointed if you go here.
24333 They are honest and kind and not out to rip you off or get as much money from you as they can.
24334 They are truly exceptional.
24335 So if you need honest, competent & friendly care at very affordable prices, you owe it to yourself and your pet to make the trip over to see Dr. Howard at Grayhawk animal hospital.
24336 You will be in good hands!
24337 You will save money, and you won't be disappointed in the least.
24338 They are truly exceptional, but that is the end result of really caring, really liking your profession and really knowing what you are doing... And we love them for it!
24339 Best in town!
24340 !
24341 I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back.
24342 Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay.
24343 Third time, yesterday?
24344 Enough to say we wont go back.
24345 Ever.
24346 Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda.
24347 Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross.
24348 Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water.
24349 I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair.
24350 Gak.
24351 We got up and left our food.
24352 Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'.
24353 Um.
24354 A better experience???
24355 Seriously?
24356 15 dollars?
24357 Ugh.
24358 Heather is awesome.
24359 She did my initial set of lashes and I've already gone back for a fill.
24360 Her prices are great and she does beautiful work!
24361 The compliments are rolling in.
24362 Absolutely recommend!
24363 I love love Barrio Cafe.
24364 The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy.
24365 Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. I'm not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while it's not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures.
24366 I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer.
24367 With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy).
24368 I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice.
24369 The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked.
24370 Every time.
24371 Love this place.
24372 I'm a pho snob, my hitlist is impressive.
24373 In Olympia, I ate pho literally every single day.
24374 Test me, wannabe purists...
24375 Nam Sao is the best.
24376 The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet.
24377 Great service, my drink never goes empty, and the table is set in traditional pho-joint style: a metal caddy with spoons, forks [...], chopsticks, napkins, and all the delicious condiments.
24378 The menu is enormous, so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious, never-watered-down noodle soup, you can try something else.
24379 The spring rolls, I love them.
24380 The boba tea is great too, I've had it thicker and more rich at Pho Hoa in Oly but I like the less creamy variety served at Nam Sao.
24381 Fast service, cheap filling meal, wonderful server..
24382 I literally cannot think of anything bad to say about Nam Sao, except it's so small it's kind of hard to find if you're new to the spot.
24383 Just go to the right of Fry's and you'll see this little piece of heaven with its lights on, welcoming you in.
24384 Great quality, great prices.
24385 If only they had longer hours, delivery of large items, and a gift registry, it'd be heaven.
24386 I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to.
24387 Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar.
24388 As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well.
24389 The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had.
24390 We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle.
24391 As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face.
24392 We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point.
24393 We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer.
24394 I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food.
24395 I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management.
24396 Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week.
24397 Horrible.
24398 Most livable city my eye!
24399 Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.
24400 I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.
24401 Avoid at all cost.
24402 This place is awful.
24403 I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile, and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments.
24404 They wont accept a tip from your debit/credit card which is pretty inconvenient if you don't carry cash.
24405 They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky.
24406 My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit.
24407 I don't like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business.
24408 Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike.
24409 Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging.
24410 Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout.
24411 All I can say is "yum!"
24412 I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated, to be honest.
24413 I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.
24414 I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink.
24415 The first time we went there, we sat at the "outside" bar.
24416 The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude.
24417 When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, "well, there's not a button for it so I don't know."
24418 He then rolled his eyes and walked away.
24419 I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off.
24420 I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude.
24421 My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.
24422 After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us.
24423 When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello.
24424 I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself.
24425 She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice.
24426 (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar.
24427 For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender.
24428 But how is that my fault?
24429 I didn't know that.
24430 And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.)
24431 That was the "straw that broke the camel's back" for me.
24432 We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.
24433 We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service.
24434 The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service.
24435 The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us.
24436 I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot.
24437 The worse food and service.
24438 I have never given a bad review.
24439 I ordered a shrimp dish with brown rice.
24440 The waiter brought out white rice.
24441 The sauce was horrible and bland.
24442 The calamari salad was not fresh.
24443 The dressing was bland too.
24444 The waitress checked on us and we asked for check immediately.
24445 She never asked if anything was wrong or if the food was good.
24446 I would never recommend or eat here again.
24447 The service and food was horrible.
24448 I was visiting from out of town and was hoping to get a new experience.
24449 This was not it...
24450 Excellent pizza, great service, family environment in a beautiful setting.
24451 That sounds like a tagline on a website, but it's legit.
24452 The diavola and the salsiccia are my faves.
24453 Just amazingly tasty, simple, pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven.
24454 Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you don't want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.
24455 And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time..
24456 The quintessential Brewery with a wholly fantastic kitchen.
24457 Best spinach artichoke dip in the valley, period.
24458 From fried to gourmet Four Peaks has it all.
24459 Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent, fish and chips, bavarian pretzels, french fries, daily specials, I really haven't had an item that I didn't like!
24460 The weather is perfect right now for a sunny patio lunch or fresh air dinner.
24461 Let's not forget the beer.
24462 My favorites are the Oatmeal Stout or the Peach.
24463 Their peach beer is legendary with low sweetness and a crisp refreshing taste.
24464 If you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor, this is your beer.
24465 The oatmeal stout is thick and hearty with no bitterness.
24466 Seasonal beers abound, pumpkin porter in the fall, I've seen an orange blossom, belgian white, barleywine, etc.
24467 Parking close can be a challenge on weekend nights, best to ride your bike if you're close enough.
24468 http://www.fourpeaks.com for a complete menu.
24469 Just go there already!
24470 A small bite goes a long way.
24471 I first was introduced to these brownies in '09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas.
24472 I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper.
24473 After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan.
24474 The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week.
24475 The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months.
24476 I used it for baking - cookies, breads, cakes, etc.
24477 My faves: Cream Cheese, Espresso Nib, Toffee Crunch, and Caramel.
24478 The sprites are just the perfect size because it's just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming.
24479 I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon.
24480 I'm a subscriber of their email so I've been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping.
24481 It's so hard to resist.
24482 Lucky me, I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of 24 Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping.
24483 I was going to take the time to write a scathing review, but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it.
24484 1 star.
24485 That's all I can say.
24486 Excellent staff.
24487 Always knows how to make my drinks.
24488 Always remembers my orders every time I come in too.
24489 Vintage sodas sold by bottle, all of your grandmother's favorite childhood candy, an abundance of gag gifts and novelty items... you just can't dislike this place.
24490 Each time I'm in, I spend a good hour just perusing the countless Fred & Friends products and debating whether or not I should buy the stick-on-mustaches or 10 of the Chinese finger traps.
24491 But, let's be honest here.
24492 I mostly go for the photo booth.
24493 By far the best photo booth in town... good quality pictures (not cheap like the ones inside the mall) and they have little masks, glasses, and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case you're tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face.
24494 Soda.
24495 Candy.
24496 Toys.
24497 Photo booth.
24498 Don't kid yourself.
24499 You're never too old for that ish.
24500 I will never go here again.
24501 So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog.
24502 But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday.
24503 The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold.
24504 All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us.
24505 So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming.
24506 That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale.
24507 I'll continue going to to petsmart.
24508 Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service
24509 Brown bag chicken sammich, mac n cheese, fried okra, and the bourbon drink.
24510 Nuff said.
24511 A few weeks ago, I was receiving quotes to have my AC unit replaced due to the hail storm we had back in October.
24512 I had few companies come out but no one and I mean no one was as thorough as Dale with Mason Mechanical was.
24513 He spent 90 mins going over everything including climbing in the attic to check things out.
24514 He explained the differences between different units as well as what he and his team could do, which included taking out my furnace and installing a new ac/heat unit, pricing.
24515 etc.
24516 Fast forward 3 weeks later and I was able to get the appt set up to have my unit installed.
24517 Crystal set up everything for me  and she was fabulous, especially since I had to cancel the first time around due to my work schedule.
24518 (Thank you for your patience Crystal!!)
24519 Mike, the tech who was in charge of installing the new system called me promptly at 7am to let me know he was on his way and would be at my house within 30 mins.
24520 Fast forward 10 hours later and my new unit is installed.
24521 He explained everything to me including how to work my new programmable thermostat, made sure everything was in working order, sealed off the area in my now new closet (where the furnace was), made sure everything was cleaned up, and was just all around great.
24522 I am very happy that it was nice mild day here today because I don't know how they can do this in the summer.
24523 Thank you to the entire team at Mason Mechanical!
24524 A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.
24525 It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.
24526 Oh well, we went anyway.
24527 Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.
24528 When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.
24529 We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.
24530 Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.
24531 We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.
24532 All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).
24533 Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.
24534 Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.
24535 The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.
24536 Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck.
24537 Horrible service.
24538 Barely acknowledged when you first walked in.
24539 Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself.
24540 Will not come again.
24541 I recently had sunscreens installed in my entire  home by CC Sunscreens....i did research and found CC had the best prices...Carl the owner was amazing....he came to measure the day after i called.
24542 He answered all of our questions.
24543 He gave us a great price and in less than a week the screens were professionally installed.
24544 The screens are not only of the highest quality - they look great and make our home look brand new.
24545 We noticed an immediate difference in the coolness of each room -   and we look forward to saving on our energy bill too!
24546 We cant thank CC Sunscreens enough -   They are simply the best!
24547 Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!
24548 I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.
24549 My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.
24550 We found we didn't splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.
24551 We didn't break $30, which surprised me.
24552 5 stars for value and great sushi!
24553 Domo Arigato!
24554 This is not a fancy place.
24555 It's address is on Scottsdale Road, but it's easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.
24556 It's split into two sections.
24557 As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.
24558 I can't really say that I've spent any time in that section.
24559 We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.
24560 If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.
24561 The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who don't, but that's to be expected).
24562 We've been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.
24563 It's casual, and very reasonably priced.
24564 The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.
24565 The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for.
24566 I needed new tires & 2 months later my husband.
24567 Both experiences the staff went out of their way to either get it done on time or make it work price wise!
24568 I have always used them for my tire needs and we travel for jobs so we need them a lot,
24569 The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing.
24570 The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat.
24571 It's similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this.
24572 Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on.
24573 Rock on.
24574 My wife and I moved from Seattle in November of 2006.
24575 We thought we would find great, modern Mexican food all around the Valley.
24576 Fortunately we found it, but only at Barrio Cafe (so far).
24577 Barrio Cafe is a sure hit with anyone who loves Mexican food without a half plate of gray, canned refried beans.
24578 Their menu is excellent, thought put into the dishes inspired and the ingredients are fresh.
24579 It's well worth the hour wait.
24580 Downright awesome and extremely hip.
24581 A non-traditional, very out there, but very hidden coffee joint.
24582 You can't see this place from the street.
24583 It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange.
24584 It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop.
24585 As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there.
24586 Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, "what can i get for you..." Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.
24587 I gotta have my lattes.
24588 I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte.
24589 Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks.
24590 Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee.
24591 The latte here was PERFECT.
24592 The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte.
24593 Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it.
24594 Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes.
24595 This is my new coffee place.
24596 Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop.
24597 Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine.
24598 Skip the Starbucks and "Sex in the City" sorority girl drinks and come here.
24599 Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large.
24600 That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion.
24601 Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte.
24602 I learned of this company through a living social deal.
24603 I emailed them to set up an appointment.
24604 The earliest available date was a month later, I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time.
24605 One month went by,  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1... NO ONE shows up.
24606 I wait, at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?...
24607 I've yet to get a response or an explanation.
24608 There are many cleaning companies out there, my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all.
24609 I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out.
24610 It turned out to effen awesome.
24611 Fresh quality food!
24612 ChiChi- lisous!
24613 Be on the look out for these guys!
24614 Chow down baby.
24615 I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door.
24616 My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.
24617 After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).
24618 We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.
24619 Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.
24620 There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.
24621 I'll pass this one up from now on.
24622 Caught Louis CK here last night...
24623 Beautiful theater... absolutely stunning.
24624 It was clean, the staff was really nice, and parking was a breeze.
24625 The sound was great, the seats were comfy, and I can't really find anything to complain about.
24626 Truly one of the most gorgeous theaters I've seen - down to every detail - it's my new favorite...
24627 I love it.
24628 L.O.V.E.
24629 If you twisted my arm and forced me to complain - well, in the lobby where they were serving drinks, the line got a little excessive.
24630 It wasn't so bad really - but I tried both of the wine they were selling and I kinda hated them.
24631 This is more of a bit of advice for you to booze it up before you get there than it is a complaint.
24632 I can't recommend this place enough.
24633 Andrea has been a lifesaver- literally!
24634 She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out  in July and we were across the country.
24635 She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken, but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded.
24636 She's been our creature sitter several times now, thankfully with less craziness.
24637 Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you.
24638 Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done (like picking up the paper and bringing it in) and was very thorough.
24639 Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services, she's knows things to cover that we had not thought of!
24640 She's very professional and is licensed and insured.
24641 Your animals will thank you!
24642 I had the terrible decision to make to euthanize my 20 year old cat, Bandit.
24643 I was going to go to the Emergency Animal Clinic off of Scottsdale Rd.
24644 further north but I had previously had a bad experience there.
24645 I saw there were some good reviews for this Emergency Animal Hospital and, thank God I did.
24646 They were so kind and compassionate.
24647 They let us take our time, never rushed us.
24648 They knew it was a very painful thing to have to do.
24649 They made one of the worst things I have ever had to do as 'easy' as they possibly could have.
24650 They eased my nagging doubts about it without putting words in my mouth.
24651 I am ever grateful for their kindness on that incredibly sad day and would recommend them to anyone who has an animal friend who needs some emergency care.
24652 I love this Gelato!
24653 My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip.
24654 Weird but wonderful.
24655 I am rarely down this way, especially since I've moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!
24656 I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here.
24657 So far it is the best Gelato I've had, although I hear Arlecchino's is pretty fantastic as well.
24658 I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon.
24659 I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio.
24660 I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common.
24661 This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while.
24662 (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy.
24663 The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.
24664 While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers.
24665 The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints.
24666 Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina.
24667 The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it!
24668 So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio.
24669 Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners.
24670 Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.'
24671 No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is.
24672 Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah.
24673 That was him.
24674 Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic.
24675 Waiters are very attentive and helpful.
24676 I've eaten here twice in the days (conference) and I would go back.
24677 Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again.
24678 ...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'!
24679 Killer Mexican Food!
24680 The chips 'n salsa kicks ass!
24681 You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip!
24682 Hellava start!
24683 A kick-butt margarita!
24684 Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST!
24685 Cannot wait to return!
24686 Great ambiance.
24687 Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself.
24688 Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.
24689 I also like that they are not "all over you" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door.
24690 I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!
24691 Went here for a work function today.
24692 What can I say, this place is awesome!
24693 A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection.
24694 My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!
24695 Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.
24696 Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.
24697 Simply awesome stuff!
24698 Taking the wife when I can.
24699 I'm not going to lie - I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90-minute Insights tour.
24700 His spirit and convictions were brought to life by FLW and being in this incredible complex where he lived, worked and taught was indescribably cool.
24701 The tour takes you around the property and through many of the rooms, restored to various periods of Frank's life.
24702 I was a bit dismayed at the disrepair some of the rooms are in, so I spent money in the gift shop hoping it will go to repairing some sad looking chairs and windowpanes.
24703 Overall, the tour guides are genius at describing and making you feel like you're seeing things through FLW's eyes with his vision on architecture and lifestyle.
24704 This is not to be missed!
24705 Donuts are worst I've ever had.
24706 I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life.
24707 All the donuts were dry and stale.
24708 I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme.
24709 Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh.
24710 These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!
24711 This is the best Cajun place in Arizona.
24712 The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice.
24713 I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent.
24714 Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food.
24715 the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.
24716 The Rosson House Museum is a restored home from the 1895's.
24717 And it's also conveniently right next to the Teeter House Tea Room and across from Pizzeria Bianco.
24718 For under $5, you can take a guided tour of Rosson House and learn what life was like for its residents so long ago.
24719 It's a really cool activity to do, and since it's close to so many great restaurants, you can go for dinner and drinks after your tour.
24720 Walking through the home, it's easy to imagine the lady of the house sipping tea in a dainty cup with her lacy gloves on.
24721 Or maybe it's just me.
24722 Houses like this tend to creep me out.
24723 I half-expected to see a ghostly woman in a pinafore around every corner, but let me tell you, I'm glad I didn't.
24724 Either way, coming to Heritage Square and exploring the historic buildings in it is a great way to spend an afternoon.
24725 Dr. Dairiki is terrific.
24726 She is professional, listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about.
24727 I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions (plus it is done in a timely fashion.)
24728 These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand.
24729 They are honest and very smart.
24730 They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning).
24731 I would never go anywhere else!
24732 I have been coming here since 1996 and the food just keeps on getting better!!!
24733 The jerk fried rice and emerald chicken are to die for and he snicker doodle cookies....oh my goodness.
24734 Every time I'm in phoenix, this is my must go see do eat spot!!
24735 The owner Frank is awesome.
24736 I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here.
24737 I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.
24738 Let's begin with something that impressed me.
24739 When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.
24740 Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.
24741 Second, the food was great.
24742 The duck fries were really good (and free)...
24743 I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect.
24744 (I never eat those).
24745 My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.
24746 My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.
24747 The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.
24748 (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.
24749 All in all, the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky.
24750 It's about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with S.F.
24751 and NY.
24752 Our server Amanda was awesome with her suggestions and service!
24753 Would go here again in a heart beat!
24754 Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?
24755 We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality, fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.
24756 :(
24757 We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...
24758 The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.
24759 The sauce that went with them could not revive them.
24760 The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!
24761 The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed.
24762 The snap peas were stringy and overcooked.
24763 The General Chow's Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet.
24764 Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court.
24765 It wasn't cheap...and I'm not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame!
24766 I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head...
24767 Isn't there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!
24768 This QT is one of my favorite locations!
24769 It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat!
24770 The hula burger was awesome!
24771 Great service.
24772 The hostess is very kind and sweet.
24773 What a great find!
24774 Found this place through Yelp and a Yelping buddy so there you have it...the power of Yelp because we absolutely LOVED this place.
24775 Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy, eclectic little joint.
24776 From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service.
24777 We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server.
24778 The pasta fries were unique, light and paired with great tasting sauces.
24779 A definite dish you have to try.
24780 We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.
24781 Also very good & savory.
24782 But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!
24783 My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.
24784 The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
24785 The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.
24786 All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.
24787 The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.
24788 I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.
24789 Then I would go back and get it again.
24790 Great place we will frequent often.
24791 P.S.
24792 They make their own tonic.
24793 Yep, their own tonic.
24794 GREAT tasting!
24795 Try it with the vodka they serve (haven't heard of it before but was very pleased).
24796 Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.
24797 The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the "WBC" and they've discontinued making their bread salad.
24798 (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.
24799 I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.
24800 I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.
24801 After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.
24802 The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!
24803 I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.
24804 The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.
24805 This type of service is what makes a customer for life.
24806 There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping.
24807 Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered.
24808 In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale.
24809 Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible.
24810 Red Velvet, Check
24811 Parking, Valet for Free, Check
24812 Ratpack ghosts, Check
24813 Fun People, Check
24814 Strong, yet good drinks, Check
24815 Good happy hour place, Check
24816 Been Around for Ever & Deserves it Rep, Check
24817 Every item that I tried was amazing.
24818 Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice.
24819 A must try in Central Phoenix.
24820 While visiting Arizona we were told we must try Macayo's.
24821 The margaritas (fruit flavored and blended) were a bit on the sweet side- to the extent that I was worried I might get a tooth ache.
24822 The prices here are very reasonable.
24823 I had the fajita quesadilla, delicious- I cant stop thinking about it.
24824 The service was friendly and somewhat efficient.
24825 This isn't a place you go for decor and ambiance- but they do have outside seating, always a plus in my book.
24826 Oh, how I miss this Goodwill store, which opened in September 2011.
24827 I moved to North Carolina in March 2012, and have not been able to find anything like it here.
24828 Large, clean, and very well organized, this store is thrift shop heaven.
24829 And it's all for a good cause: there's a job center right on site that helps people find work.
24830 Go on Thursdays, if you can, when a designated tag color is just $1.
24831 I've purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for $1 per piece.
24832 You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price.
24833 I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for $12.50.
24834 This place is so good, I would not be writing this review if I still lived in Arizona, because I would want to keep all the bargains to myself.
24835 So freaking good.
24836 The drinks are great too.
24837 Ask for "the icon" not on menu, but very good!
24838 Love everything I had there!
24839 Service is great and food is absolutely delicious!
24840 Wish I lived closer!
24841 Chipotle is my go to place when I feel like picking up a quick meal, and this happens to be my local one.
24842 Always busy, and you'll almost always see someone you know getting some delicious Chipotle as well.
24843 Portions are huge, but no complaining because it's all delicious!
24844 I remember when this was Fry's...back in the 70's.
24845 I think it's great when these older buildings are put to good use instead of being torn down for another new strip mall.
24846 What a perfect place for an Antique Mall.
24847 This is a store that you could spend hours and hours really looking at everything.
24848 This Antique Mall has TONS of GREAT Antique finds...like REAL antique and retro STUFF, not recent overpriced crap that most Antique Dealers throw in their booth and try to pass off as something worth a lot of money.
24849 There are things here that I haven't ever seen at other Antique stores before.
24850 I quickly walked down the aisles, the prices seemed pretty good and yet some that seemed OVERPRICED.
24851 I wonder if Antique Dealers are wanting to sell merchandise or pay monthly rent to store their museum.
24852 Believe it or not, you can still get BETTER deals on ebay.
24853 Several of the booths seemed like they had a theme, like stepping back into that time era... they were merchandised nicely.
24854 The restroom even looked like some grandmother's tacky bathroom decor, it really fit in well with the antique feeling.
24855 I will definitely come back here when I have more time to shop.
24856 .
24857 This review is based solely on service - not the food.
24858 I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this - that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra.
24859 I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8.
24860 When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out.
24861 We waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the "stink eye".
24862 I am sorry that you are 18 years old, work for $8 and have a stick up your butt, but do not make us feel unwelcome.
24863 My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom - the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing - not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob.
24864 From here on out ra is ruined for me.
24865 One of the best restaurant in town.
24866 I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time !
24867 The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things.
24868 The service is great and the food is amazing !
24869 We are going again this Saturday and I can't wait to taste their New Years eve menu.
24870 Happy New year :)
24871 Was in a few weeks ago and had the white bean chicken chili.
24872 superfantasticdeliciousness.
24873 i've only had one meal out of about 20 here that i didn't like.
24874 Wildflower is one of our favorite afternoon places to grab a bite.
24875 Thanks, Louis!
24876 hamburgessa heaven.
24877 Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious.
24878 I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat.
24879 Also, the condiment BAR is brilliant
24880 FILLY-B's!!!!!
24881 only 8 reviews??
24882 NINE now!!
24883 !
24884 wow do i miss THIS place:
24885 - 24hrs
24886 - drive-thru or walk up only
24887 - ridiculously cheap
24888 - ridiculously tasty
24889 of course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good.
24890 i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.
24891 wow.
24892 color me silly and call me sally.
24893 they have bomb horchata too.
24894 really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos.
24895 damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober.
24896 Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town.
24897 Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied.
24898 I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far!
24899 I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!
24900 If you haven't been to this place - go!
24901 Seriously.
24902 It's amazing.
24903 It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find.
24904 And it's cheap!
24905 Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner.
24906 The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.
24907 Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America.
24908 It's amazing.
24909 There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.
24910 Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me.
24911 It's definitely the best one.
24912 These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!
24913 The other dishes are really good, too.
24914 For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's.
24915 They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.
24916 I honestly LOVE it here.
24917 If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner.
24918 For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.
24919 I can't recommend this place enough!
24920 Honey jalapeño chicken lollipops and sweet potato tots are probably some of the most delicious things ever.
24921 I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever.
24922 I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults.
24923 I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.
24924 I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game.
24925 She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.
24926 The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.
24927 Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door.
24928 Seriously?
24929 Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and I'm sorry that I spent the $68.
24930 I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out.
24931 If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would.
24932 It was unbelievable.
24933 I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better.
24934 I don't think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago.
24935 I struggled to give 2 stars, but figured the wings were decent .
24936 #1) No celery salt on the Dog
24937 #2) No cucumber on the Dog
24938 #3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO, was not off a spit it was processed
24939 #4) Also, living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins.
24940 #5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki
24941 #6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100% New York
24942 #7) Wings are a 6 out of 10
24943 #8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST??
24944 ?
24945 #9) I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star...
24946 PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU"RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!
24947 !
24948 Don't think I will give this place another shot no reason
24949 I am in love with this place.
24950 Everything is delicious.
24951 I have been in a few times now and hands down the best thing there is the asian mushroom soup.
24952 The portion size is perfect for lunch.
24953 They offer a sampling of 3 soups with bread, which is perfect since I can't ever make up my mind.
24954 Last time was in Janet was serving roasted red pepper and sausage frittatas and bacon and egg soup both of which were excellent.
24955 I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.
24956 It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.
24957 I was COMPLETELY wrong.
24958 This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.
24959 The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.
24960 They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.
24961 The food in Deseo is amazing.
24962 I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.
24963 I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe.
24964 We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).
24965 They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities.
24966 Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.
24967 When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.
24968 This was a very thoughtful touch.
24969 If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.
24970 I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.
24971 Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.
24972 Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.
24973 Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.
24974 When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort.
24975 I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars.
24976 I'm a giver.
24977 Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time.
24978 Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink.
24979 Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home.
24980 I could live there.
24981 Exposed brick?
24982 Me too!
24983 Felt right at home.
24984 I love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists.
24985 I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking.
24986 However, no problems there - thankfully.
24987 :)
24988 i don't say, too many prayers
24989 saint or sinner, i don't care
24990 which is worse, which is better
24991 corinthians, apostles' letters
24992 don't read the bible, preach the word
24993 no born again, but i have heard
24994 of saintly acts, around this town
24995 the volunteers, each morning bound
24996 unselfishly, they give their time
24997 a day, an hour,  can remind
24998 you how, sometimes, the way things go
24999 to count your blessings, never know
25000 hungry, homeless, most are blessed
25001 St Mary's cares, for all the rest
25002 feeding famished, forty years
25003 donations come, from far and near
25004 warehoused, sorted, then sent out
25005 deserving families, who, no doubt
25006 would otherwise, just not be fed
25007 but gratefully, they go to bed
25008 with bellies full and filled with hope
25009 thanks to St Mary's, most can cope
25010 with unemployment, cost of gas
25011 mounting bills and dwindling cash
25012 humbly they come, take what they need
25013 a box or two, enough to feed
25014 their families, ease their malaise
25015 for weeks, or just, a couple days
25016 so volunteer, you wont regret
25017 it's what you give, not what you get
25018 easy to say, you could, or should
25019 but doing good, will do you good
25020 we just showed up, put us to work
25021 boxes of apples, stand and sort
25022 with kids from SARRC, autistic, all
25023 http://www.autismcenter.org/default.aspx
25024 joked and laughed, sacked and hauled
25025 bags and boxes,  we 'gotter dun'
25026 side by side, some old, some young
25027 so be a saint, they need your help
25028 then write and post, reviews on yelp
25029 that maybe, someone else might read
25030 and too, will help, good folks in need
25031 Love this store!
25032 Were really helpful when I helped plan a replica white house dinner for DESERT SHADOWS MIDDLE SCHOOL for 370 7th graders.
25033 Gave me a discount on the party supplies I purchased for the event.
25034 Even called others stores to find me the extra stuff they didn't have.
25035 Love their halloween section too.
25036 It's my one stop shop for parties!
25037 Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompie's has been the only option for good Jewish deli.
25038 In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompie's They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat.
25039 She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better.
25040 So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies.
25041 I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup.
25042 I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered.
25043 As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient.........
25044 THE SOUP!!!!!
25045 When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order.
25046 This was more than screwing up a order.
25047 This was forgetting the soup in SOUP.
25048 They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container.
25049 I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup!
25050 I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.
25051 I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food.
25052 You will be highly disappointed with Chompies.
25053 This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp.
25054 My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these.
25055 I hope you take my advice.
25056 Warning, don't get deterred that there aren't any seats for you when you walk in... that's a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.
25057 I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and I'm glad I did.
25058 It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.
25059 I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.
25060 The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.
25061 The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum!
25062 Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal.
25063 I can't wait to go back!
25064 I chose this place because of the 100% rating on urbanspoon.com & the proximity to the hotel my family was staying at.
25065 We were absolutely blown away.
25066 Don't let the location of a strip mall deter you from this place.
25067 The food is absolutely perfect.
25068 I had the bouillabaisse while my 2 table mates had steak.
25069 Each dish was prepared perfectly.
25070 The service was also some of the best service we have ever had at any restaurant.
25071 The waitress was so attentive & detail oriented.
25072 I never had to ask for anything, she always knew exactly what I needed.
25073 My water & iced tea was never below halfway.
25074 At the end of the meal, the owner/chef came out to greet us & that was such a nice gesture.
25075 We were so happy to compliment him & his restaurant.
25076 My visiting family even said that they would gladly come back to this place on their next visit.
25077 This place is so great & you just need to go visit it!
25078 Mojo's was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!
25079 Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!
25080 Went here before a Phx Suns game.
25081 DELICIOUS!
25082 Everything on the menu looked amazing.
25083 I forgot what it was called, but the open-faced steak sandwich was my favorite!
25084 All the dishes were even presented nicely!
25085 Will definitely eat here again!
25086 i love, love, love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care.
25087 i recommend them to all my friends.
25088 good service, nice people, great prices, reliable.....  what more can you ask for?
25089 Only 10 min away from walking distant.
25090 This is really really really good, also really really really bad.
25091 I am almost finished with trying each soynami....
25092 So far and not a fan of the one with banana.
25093 YET EVERYTHING is.... just... just good.
25094 Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing, dance, and exclaiming goodness oozing.
25095 Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate.
25096 RL:
25097 NOTE: Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands.
25098 10min?
25099 Worth the wait, worth the walk, worth the extra chocolate ;)
25100 Great restaurant!
25101 I had the brisket sandwich and loved it.
25102 They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal.
25103 The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere.
25104 If you want some good ol fashion barbecue- try this place out, you won't be let down
25105 Sushi is not just a meal, it's an experience...Everything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art.
25106 The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette.
25107 Yasu's does this like no other sushi place...The fish is pristine, the rice like air, and the flavors intense and varied.
25108 My wife and I live a stone's throw from this place you would never see it if you didn't know it was there.
25109 It's like a little secret that is starting to get out...All I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix, period.
25110 Get the fried oyster rolls, get the grilled mackerel or trout...just try it!
25111 01/04/2012
25112 I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of "Daddy Long Legs," ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!
25113 The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.
25114 It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?
25115 Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.
25116 It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?
25117 However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!
25118 I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend "Daddy Long Legs" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!
25119 (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)
25120 I'd go back the next time I'm in town.
25121 Its friendly in here.
25122 My friends and I just went in here to peek but we were presented in glasses of rose.
25123 It was good, so I checked their stores of champagne (I like it pink).
25124 I should have bought a bottle but we were on our way to an interview or dinner.
25125 Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is.
25126 However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st.
25127 It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top.
25128 Be very careful it's easy to loose the trail on that side too.
25129 Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend.
25130 Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.
25131 Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians.
25132 Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched..
25133 I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time!
25134 Thanks Micky!
25135 Love massages and facials!
25136 I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.
25137 Great technique.
25138 Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs.
25139 This place is so unique!
25140 I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I won't hold that against them!
25141 This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome!
25142 My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown.
25143 The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars.
25144 You definitely get a good sized drink!
25145 The beers are cheap, the food is so-so.
25146 I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand.
25147 The boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing.
25148 Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times.
25149 I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time.
25150 Sometimes it's rap, others rockabilly and oldies.
25151 On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and I've been really wanting to try that!
25152 i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised it's not packed all the time!
25153 Haven't been here since 1997!
25154 Man, now all the memories are back and can't wait to get situated in AZ for a couple days!
25155 ;-)
25156 Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst?
25157 Because I'm a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations.
25158 Not so.
25159 Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.
25160 Nice all around.
25161 Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.
25162 I did not check by the glass.
25163 Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected.
25164 Husband had:
25165 Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious.
25166 Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly.
25167 Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.
25168 Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato).
25169 I had:
25170 Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You can't imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.
25171 A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.
25172 You might as well as shaved gold on the side.
25173 Sliced filet - I'm not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES!
25174 (Is it fantastic?
25175 Is it cooked to perfection?
25176 Is the flavor wonderful?
25177 Is it a great cut?)
25178 Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.
25179 Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.
25180 Service - Our server was so outstanding I'm going to contact the manager at this location.
25181 Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy.
25182 We could not hear our neighbors.
25183 Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation.
25184 Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate.
25185 Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic.
25186 Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup???
25187 Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us.
25188 I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro.
25189 They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.
25190 Update 11/8/2010
25191 Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.
25192 I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.
25193 I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.
25194 We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.
25195 I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.
25196 There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.
25197 Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.
25198 We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.
25199 The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.
25200 The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.
25201 Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.
25202 4 stars for the place itself and it's food/coffee.
25203 0 stars for the service, or lack there of.
25204 My business partner and I were in town for a convention.
25205 We heard we should check out Lola.
25206 So we did.
25207 We were excited.
25208 The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.
25209 We asked a few questions.
25210 She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.
25211 An example.
25212 We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.
25213 She mumbled something about the bar/table.
25214 My partner walked over and saw no cups.
25215 She came back and asked where the cups were.
25216 On the table came an exasperated retort.
25217 I walked over to inspect for myself.
25218 There were no cups on the table.
25219 So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.
25220 She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!
25221 10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.
25222 IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.
25223 I watched this lady serve other customers.
25224 It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.
25225 Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.
25226 My suggestion to management, adjust her attitude or get rid of her!
25227 She is not good for business.
25228 Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch, and wow!
25229 This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School & 48th Street is a must visit if you're in the Arcadia area.
25230 The food here is amazing, and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots (even sweet potato tater tots) and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen.
25231 You get a good sized portion as well.
25232 Thank goodness for take-home boxes!
25233 The restaurant is very spacious, and the staff is really friendly & laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time.
25234 It gets better; the price of the food is VERY reasonable, in fact, I'm kind of shocked how inexpensive they are.
25235 A well deserved five stars!
25236 First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever.
25237 I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold.
25238 We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies.
25239 The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 24 hour notice that their "gourmet tamales" require for such a large order.
25240 The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili.
25241 The "hot Sauce" they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added.
25242 Next time I'll just go to Del Taco where two dozen .40 cent tacos do not require a 24 hr notice from a family of 6.
25243 I went to cowboy ciao for my birthday and was very pleased with it!
25244 My family typically likes to get a bunch of stuff and share so we started with a chopped salad, the shrimp appetizer and the mushroom appetizer.
25245 The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were really flavorful and delicious, however, the chopped salad was the star of the night!
25246 It was so good I ended up ordering another one because the first one was devoured so fast.
25247 I typically don't think of salads as memorable dishes but this is by far the best salad I have ever had and I would come back just for the chopped salad.
25248 To finish it all off, the server brought me a huge piece of delicious chocolate cake on a plate that said happy birthday which was a nice touch!
25249 I would definitely recommend this restaurant - great atmosphere and even better food!
25250 Love it here.
25251 Come regularly now lol thanks to everyone on yelp.
25252 Great food cheap price great service.
25253 Tho not 100 percent authentic Chinese food still great
25254 Absolutely beautiful grounds.
25255 Golf course, restaurants, shops, botanical gardens, tennis courts...it's all beautiful.
25256 Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel - I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but it IS a different (and smaller) building.
25257 Our room itself was nice, but the view was what made it amazing.
25258 From the balcony, you can see the golf course, the mountain, desert views, cactus...everything.
25259 And the service was great.
25260 The only complaint is that when I booked my stay, I was told that each guest would be assigned an "Ambassador" who would help ensure a great stay, or whatever.
25261 But throughout my weekend, this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didn't show up.
25262 Not a big deal, but if you're going to promise that service, then you better deliver.
25263 Otherwise, great stay.
25264 I would highly recommend this hotel.
25265 Great for a relaxing weekend.
25266 What  a beautiful facility.
25267 Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his / her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job.
25268 If you want a high end place to stay.
25269 This is a good choice.
25270 When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here, I got the deal of the century!
25271 I am sure the rack rate is high, but if you want comfort and great facility.
25272 this would be a wonderful choice!
25273 Oh yes, Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice.
25274 The gardeners,  the cleaning staff, the front desk, the parking attendant, all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service..
25275 I moved to AZ about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other "salons."
25276 I wear my hair in a short pixie cut and it's very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so I don't  end up with a mans cut.
25277 I found Epic Salon here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.
25278 I could not be more pleased.
25279 My appointment yesterday was with Chey and she's wonderful.
25280 I am very exacting when it comes to how I like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so I can articulate what I want.
25281 Chey listened very well and understood what I wanted.
25282 She totally delivered.
25283 I am so very relieved to have found her.
25284 And at $26 (cut only, no blow out) it's a real deal.
25285 I do love rum and should review the Rum Bar separately but both the Rum Bar and the Breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome!
25286 Great recommendations from the waiter... Brown Stew Chicken and Jerk Chicken are really good... really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me!
25287 I'll take my plantains baked over fried any day!
25288 SO GOOD!
25289 Really great place to go for not so typical food!
25290 The entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way.
25291 Their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu, environment and service, which is rare to see in restaurant employees.
25292 Not to mention a perfect location ... very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix!
25293 Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that it's not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.
25294 It also is so understaffed it's impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.
25295 I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.
25296 I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.
25297 I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.
25298 I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.
25299 Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.
25300 so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?
25301 I say sure do and hand it to her.
25302 Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.
25303 I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.
25304 She says I've never heard of that before.
25305 Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.
25306 she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.
25307 She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.
25308 My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.
25309 Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.
25310 So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.
25311 They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.
25312 And that's not even the bad part!
25313 I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.
25314 Each time I explain it's a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.
25315 they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.
25316 I wouldn't shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellip's it's a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.
25317 It's well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.
25318 They have even  framed two other items while I'm still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat.
25319 This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.
25320 They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.
25321 So I thank them for that!
25322 Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.
25323 They take an added effort to get to know their customers.
25324 They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.
25325 Bleh.
25326 Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time.
25327 It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place.
25328 It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.
25329 Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side.
25330 And whales.
25331 And scary looking people.
25332 And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.
25333 We ordered two beers and sat down.
25334 Why not give it a chance, right?
25335 Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound.
25336 Like a squealing sound.
25337 Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?!
25338 Why God, why????
25339 ?
25340 We chugged our beers and left.
25341 From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you don't get to see everyday.
25342 Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, "Welcome to our business".
25343 I don't normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite.
25344 They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!
25345 So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out.
25346 Since then we have both been in to have work done.
25347 My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened.
25348 I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.
25349 She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle.
25350 I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.
25351 My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.
25352 I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work.
25353 Again gentle and quick.
25354 My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful.
25355 They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.
25356 I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors.
25357 The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge.
25358 That might be something they want to work out.
25359 Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone.
25360 I've been to this Pita Jungle a few times, about 3-4 and ordered carry-out once.
25361 Every single time my experience was great.
25362 Great service, great food, and great atmosphere.
25363 I've ate at the patio once during a rare cold winter night, and the waiter, without us even asking, put a heater right next to us.
25364 It was really nice and kept us warm while we ate our food.
25365 At times it gets busy, but the wait has never been too long and annoying.
25366 This place is great, and compared to other Pita Jungle's I've been to (the one on Shea, Tempe, and Downtown Phoenix) this Pita Jungle has to be the best.
25367 The ambiance is nice, and the decor is very welcoming.
25368 A big open room for the dinning space works well.
25369 Picazzo's is a freaking miracle for gluten "allergies"!
25370 Almost everything there is gluten free, and you can get something besides gluten free pizza.
25371 I highly recommend going during happy hour and just eating the starters - meatball sliders are awesome!
25372 Pizza is very good as well.
25373 More reasonably priced than a lot of the chain places that get their (really friggin' expensive) dough from somewhere else.
25374 People with celiacs:  rejoice.
25375 Picazzo's is legendary.
25376 Yes, she did go to another...it's a hobby what can I say.
25377 By far, this is the LARGEST club I've been in!
25378 But my list of places to visit is still very long, so there may be bigger.
25379 I liked it here, the girls and managers, and this is important to me, were chill and nice.
25380 Some variation in looks for the girls but not much, but then again, maybe there is more to select from at night.
25381 I'm a day club visitor, because I hate to pay cover and other unnecessary costs.
25382 This place has a nice size bar, and a freaking huge main stage, with three, yes count them, three two-story tall poles (And some of the girls climb all the way to the top!).
25383 And it doesn't end there, there was a more private but large room toward the back with another stage and tall pole.
25384 There's an upstairs to this place too!
25385 I like to wander, I have a curious sense of adventure.
25386 I found multiple smaller private rooms up there, along with small mirrored rooms with single chairs.
25387 You know for that kind of one-on-one that no ones all up in your business about kind of room, just you and the dancer...Then there is the balcony that wraps around the upper floor, plenty of seating, with DJ in the center, spinning whatever the ladies on stage ask for (this is rare, some DJ's will tell you to take a flying leap if you demand a song, so I've been told...).
25388 This place is lit well too, not enough to make you run out screaming of blindness, but good enough to see.
25389 May I add that this is the first time I didn't have to go through a dressing room full of half-naked women to get to the restroom, it was separate and had more than one toilet in it, yes, amazing I know!
25390 I've been won over, lets see the other places on my list top this!
25391 Absolutely adorable!
25392 This place made our 5 (yep you heard it here...5) hour wait much more enjoyable.
25393 I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for 5 hours, I may have gone nuts.
25394 Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal.
25395 We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner.
25396 Not only is this bar a great 'waiting room' before Pizzeria Bianco, but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink.
25397 Cheers!
25398 I think I may be addicted to this place.
25399 This location is a  bit out of my way, but after a terrible experience at the Superstition Springs Buffalo Wild Wings this became my go-to place.
25400 All of the servers are incredibly nice and efficient, and my order always comes exactly as I ordered.
25401 I've been here twice during the 2011 Stanley Cup finals and was happy that they had the sound on loud enough in the bar, but not too loud that you had to shout to the other people at the table.
25402 The food is consistently perfect, the atmosphere is great, and all of the employees I have encountered are friendly.
25403 The drink specials aren't too bad either.
25404 You can't go wrong!
25405 AZ 88 is a great date location.
25406 The atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display, usually great music.
25407 If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin, I'm definitely taking them to AZ 88.
25408 The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool, and the proximity to a number of the "old" Old Town bars is really convenient.
25409 The food is reasonably priced, with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10.
25410 They have a good sized bar selection, with some really interesting imported beers.
25411 I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce, and it's really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them (even despite disliking bacon!
25412 ).
25413 The best Chinese food I have had since leavong Chinatown in California.
25414 The crab puffs had crab, not Krab and were much more crab than puff.
25415 The food was cooked perfectly and delicious.
25416 I strongly recommend the Mu Shu Pork!
25417 !
25418 Four Peaks baby.
25419 This spot is awesome.
25420 Great place to meet up with a crowd, grub, and pound some craft brew.
25421 The food is great: dope appetizers , rockin' burgers, decent pizza, and daily specials.
25422 The beer is fantastic, hop knot being my fave.
25423 They have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers, a light night menu, TV's, and a pool table.
25424 I've gotten mashed here more than a few times.
25425 Sunday brunch is killer, and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake, a little known secret, but good for the sweet toof.
25426 Don't miss out on the Peaks.
25427 My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo.
25428 Good choice on our behalf!
25429 We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft).
25430 They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza.
25431 Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.
25432 I was VERY impressed by their beer list!
25433 They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere.
25434 When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a "Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch).
25435 I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did!
25436 I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store.
25437 Two thumbs up!
25438 Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great.
25439 Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I.
25440 Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.
25441 Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back.
25442 I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone.
25443 If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out!
25444 I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their "team trivia nights" soon - sounds like a blast.
25445 awesome and delicious place!
25446 good for groups!
25447 I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.
25448 This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.
25449 The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo.
25450 Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better.
25451 The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.
25452 It was outta this world good.
25453 I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good.
25454 It's my fav starbuck cuz it's across the street form my house.
25455 It taunts me daily.
25456 Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime.
25457 The people who work there remember the regulars and offer suggestions and even help you save money by working the angles to get you the combination special price.
25458 Also a good place for people watching or picking up a little something on the way to the light rail or antiquing up 7th Ave.
25459 We went to this place for my birthday, wanting to try out something new.
25460 We'd never had Ethiopian food and we were very adventurous.
25461 Be warned, we had a GPS and we had a very hard time finding it, it's tucked away in a little corner!
25462 Once we found it and stepped inside, we were definitely wow'd!
25463 The waiter answered our questions about the food, and suggested that if we really want the Ethiopian experience, to try out the Strictly Vegan combo.
25464 We ordered Tikil Gomen, Misir Watt, Kik Misir Watt, Gomen Watt, Shuro Watt, and the Dubba.
25465 We fell in love with the Shuro and the Misir Watt.
25466 The Shuro is chickpeas in a cinnamon/spicy sauce, and the Misir is spiced lentils.
25467 Soooo tasty!
25468 Even non-vegetarians will enjoy this place, and they do have meat dishes.
25469 Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed.
25470 My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had.
25471 Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic.
25472 I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch.
25473 Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.
25474 In short - Jen rocks!
25475 Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.
25476 I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.
25477 I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.
25478 Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.
25479 It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.
25480 After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.
25481 The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away.
25482 She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.
25483 Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!
25484 Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.
25485 I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!
25486 We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future.
25487 The best Vietnamese I have ever had.
25488 Very authentic menu (not even in English).
25489 Great service and knowledgeable staff.
25490 The ambiance is lackluster, but this is typical with Vietnamese food.
25491 Great for dining in quickly or taking home.
25492 I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby.
25493 I have nothing but great things to say about the shop.
25494 They are friendly and courteous and I haven't experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS.
25495 I am glad I found a local shop with great service
25496 Awesome place.
25497 I am pretty sure that this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.
25498 Honeycomb, radishes, and a huge heap of rainbow valley butter for an appetizer?
25499 what?!
25500 Whaat?
25501 I had to take a picture of it.
25502 The waitress gave me a hard time about this, but she was cool :p
25503 My coworkers and I went on a mission to try everything here.
25504 I do remember the brussel sprouts being too salty.
25505 but everything else was great.
25506 spicy broccoli...
25507 fat-fat cooked potatoes....
25508 perfectly grilled ribeeyeeeee.. .yummm..
25509 but i dooo remember the brussel sprouts being a bit too salty for me.. but i forgave them for this.
25510 In addition to the great food, it's a cute little restaurant with a lot of character.
25511 The servers (who are also your bartenders - i thought this was a bit interesting) are really friendly.
25512 Good memories here!
25513 My first and only experience there was excellent.
25514 The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy.
25515 The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent.
25516 The tzatziki was the best I've had.
25517 Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic.
25518 The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough.
25519 The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy.
25520 The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made.
25521 The environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized.
25522 I will be back!
25523 I love this place.
25524 I especially love it on Tuesdays when it's free.
25525 I have been to many lectures, openings and films at the Museum and am always fascinated.
25526 The changing photography exhibit is always fantastic.
25527 The fashion room is one of my favorite features.
25528 BUT my favorite piece is the firefly installation.
25529 I could seriously live in that room.
25530 I take everyone I know and everyone is always as mesmerized as I am, and I have seen it many times.
25531 I love the new contemporary wing of the museum.
25532 I also love the glass boxes on the sides of the building.
25533 One time we were there during a thunderstorm and sat in the glass box and watched the lightening.
25534 It was perfect!
25535 The museum always makes me happy.
25536 Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!!
25537 Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.
25538 I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal.
25539 When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs.
25540 This must not be a practiced any longer.
25541 I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response.
25542 Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes.
25543 I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1.
25544 The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does.
25545 After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up.
25546 Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything.
25547 This happened each time I went there.
25548 C'mon man
25549 DD has great food, friendly staff, and a wonderful patio.
25550 The breakfast menu is the best in downtown Scottsdale.
25551 DD is also great for lunch and early evening.
25552 The Happy Hour menu is a great value.
25553 I have been there many times and the food and service is consistently top rate.
25554 The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!
25555 The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion.
25556 There are gardens and walkways to explore.
25557 From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.
25558 Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed.
25559 I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo.
25560 Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious.
25561 The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to "groin-grabbingly delicious."
25562 (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast.
25563 Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks.
25564 The grand-daddy of breakfast foods.
25565 The service here is generally solid.
25566 Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.
25567 I'll return... and return... and return.
25568 I'm hooked.
25569 I only wish Morning Glory wasn't closed for the summer!
25570 Killing me.
25571 Just got 5 Diamond Dermabrasion  On Arms, Back and Face and I Love it  She is a perfectionist,  Organize, Clean, and the most amazing quality service  she finished my facial with Ice I basically melted This is My Best present for My coming B Day  this Sunday I will Look like I am in High School this weekend with m Super Fresh Skin PaulGStudio.com highly recommends this better that The Red Door service and amazing and real Customer Service.
25572 She has a 1/2 off coupon on the entrance of the building for the first service  Please Enjoy
25573 Been going to Don and Charlie's for years now.
25574 It's kind of a family tradition.
25575 A sports hangout, you may see some players and coaches during the off season as Scottsdale is a big place for spring training.
25576 (This delighted my single girlfriends who took every opportunity to flirt the entire time I visited with them).
25577 The bar is roomy and comfortable, with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush.
25578 Say hello to Shelley who is mi favorito bartender!
25579 You are welcome to dine at the bar, but the dining room is much more comfortable, with a great deal of banquette seating-  which I adore.
25580 I often have the veal chop, or a nice, big NY Strip.
25581 Twice baked potatoes, creamed spinach......you know the routine in the "good old boys' steakhouse."
25582 The best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for.
25583 Valet service rounds out the numerous reasons to choose this place over others in the area.
25584 I almost forgot the comprehensive wine list, including wines by the glass.
25585 A must stop when you are in Scottsdale!
25586 I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson.
25587 Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost.
25588 Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue.
25589 The San Tan village location is 25 minutes away but the drive is worthwhile.
25590 The staff is friendly, helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish.
25591 I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel.
25592 Truly delightful!
25593 Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area.
25594 I think Tempe would be a great choice!
25595 Hint hint....
25596 Beware... use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to.
25597 ( our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10% discount ).
25598 Big mistake,  Any problem you're on your own...really... On your own!
25599 We've spent over $3,000 at this store and it has been a nightmare.
25600 Delivery took  weeks longer then our sales person said & our paper work indicated.
25601 There was a mistake with the fabric, the paint was mismatched, what was to take 10 days took 3 months.
25602 Not a darn thing was handled properly.
25603 Every call we made to "customer service" was routed directly  back to our  sales person.
25604 We went back to the store  in person but there is no mgr, no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round.
25605 Don't usually give 5 stars, but this is good sushi.
25606 At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment.
25607 The rolls are original and all very good.
25608 The Climax('s) and the Elliot are my favorite.
25609 Great activity for kids.
25610 It's clean, spacious and safe.
25611 Received two more messages from "Iolanda" this morning.
25612 Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.
25613 I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.
25614 Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW, don't you just love orangeheads??
25615 Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!
25616 19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......
25617 9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!!
25618 I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!
25619 !
25620 Wow what a fun little antique,etc.
25621 store I stumbled across the other day!
25622 I stopped in at the Starbucks for a refresher and noticed all of this funky stuff out in front of the store!
25623 I went inside and it was a combination of an 19th century hardware store and art walk.
25624 There was just a little bit of everything-
25625 some vintage, shabby chic, crystal door pulls - industrial - toys.
25626 The owners are great and are going to help me find a little period table I've been searching for.
25627 Lot of great accents!
25628 I'm hooked!
25629 I'll be back with a vengence!
25630 AMAZING.
25631 Everything we had was the best we have eaten; sushi, crab cakes, oysters!
25632 It's a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter!
25633 We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row, once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour.
25634 This was the perfect lunch!
25635 I got the Sack's Symphony with turkey, bacon, avocado, sprouts, tomato and cream cheese.
25636 It was SO SO good.
25637 The combination was prefect.
25638 There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on- it definitely filled me up.
25639 It's clear the place is a well-loved lunch spot- it was a full house at 1:00.
25640 I can't wait to go back.
25641 Great shopping place for clothes, jewelry, art and home decor!
25642 One of those GREAT finds and the owners are really nice.
25643 It has boutique clothing at affordable prices, great atmosphere and FRIENDLY!!!
25644 !
25645 Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food.
25646 It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out.
25647 Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited.
25648 Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken.
25649 As we were looking at the "lunch special" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead.
25650 Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom "are you Chinese?"
25651 Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in "what does that mean?"
25652 The lady proceeded by pointing at the "seafood pancake" section on the menu and saying "I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."
25653 Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else...
25654 So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19).
25655 The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini "kimchi" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables.
25656 It also has this delicious house special hot sauce.
25657 By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long.
25658 The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it.
25659 The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it.
25660 The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath.
25661 The beef was definitely not marinated fully.
25662 The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless.
25663 The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba.
25664 The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet.
25665 Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat.
25666 In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...).
25667 While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover.
25668 This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said "you can't take that home".
25669 I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles.
25670 Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said "you are not allowed to take the kimchi home".
25671 Wow seriously?
25672 Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out?
25673 "Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"
25674 She hesitantly gave me a lid.
25675 "Hey, hey you.
25676 we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'"... only if I said that to her face...
25677 Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.
25678 Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang.
25679 Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down
25680 3 months, 22 emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget!
25681 Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!
25682 I been here once and I loved it!!
25683 Food here is amazing!
25684 Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!
25685 It's communal seating so get to know other guest!
25686 Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!
25687 OMG!
25688 I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)
25689 I am totally addicted to this place.
25690 Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba.
25691 Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors I've tried have been fantastic.
25692 Words cannot express how much I love the meat shop.
25693 I love it like a fat guy loves the place that sells him the best bacon he has ever had... because I am and it is.
25694 I'll be honest, it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time, if you aren't a chef and don't know your cuts, you may be afraid, but don't fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent!
25695 Whether beef, pork or lamb, the meat here is always the best quality, and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better.
25696 And price?
25697 I've never compared closely but I don't really think twice about the price here!
25698 Be warned!
25699 If you buy meat here, you will be ruined!
25700 You will never again be able to purchase that saltwater packed, antibiotic injected, hormonally treated, ammonia and pink good filled crap in your supermarket again!
25701 And that is a very, very good thing.
25702 I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz.
25703 The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect.
25704 I was blown away how funny it got at times.
25705 Good clean funny.
25706 We went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times.
25707 Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments.
25708 Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back.
25709 What a great place to hike/ run/ shred!
25710 It's a great hike to shake up the routine with.
25711 A steep hike with bits of scrambling to a summit with amazing views.
25712 The only downside is there's mad crowds of people snaking their way up and down the hill.
25713 I feel for humanity sake I must pass on some words of advice.
25714 1) If you need to pass- Just say "Excuse Me" or "On your left/right" or, if those don't work, "Can I pass?"
25715 Don't frustrate yourself and huff and puff behind someone because they can't interpret your grunts.
25716 2) The railing sections.
25717 Yes, it's steep but if you see someone running down using the railing and trying to go fast- LET GO and let them pass.
25718 There's this thing called gravity and it will keep you firmly on this earth.
25719 Trust me you're not going to fly off into space nor topple over backwards.
25720 Then you can grab the railing and pull yourself up if that's what you need to do.
25721 3) I can't believe I have to mention this- DON'T FREAKIN' SMOKE on the trail.
25722 Apparently there are some who can't savor life's moments without puffing on a cigarette.
25723 But if I see you smoking as I hike this thing I will be forced to kick you in the shins.
25724 I can't help it it's what happens when I inhale second hand smoke.
25725 4) Your trash does not add to the ambiance.
25726 Pack out what you take in.
25727 This includes dog owners.
25728 Pick it up.
25729 Nothing will decompose because this is a desert.
25730 Just sayin'
25731 5) Finally, sometimes in life when we arrive to our destination and find the parking lot full one must consider finding other options.
25732 Yeah, you in the SUV waiting with the engine running for a spot at the nearest stall to the trail head.
25733 Park down the road and walk up.
25734 Ridiculous.
25735 Happy Hiking!
25736 The BEST Japanese food in AZ!
25737 Guaranteed!
25738 When you are looking for original Japanese food, or the closest taste to Japan, this would be it!
25739 The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love!
25740 Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, don't forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!!
25741 Love this place so much!
25742 I'm a sucker for a yummy coconut cupcake and Tammie Coe has the best around as far as I've tasted, and I've eaten a lot of bad coconut cupcakes -- all in the name of research of course.
25743 Keep 'em coming, Tammie!
25744 Great pizza and awesome must have guacamole pizza appitizer!!!
25745 !
25746 This place was horrible!
25747 I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.
25748 I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy.
25749 My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas.
25750 three  words it sucked, sucked, sucked!
25751 Just fantastic.
25752 I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately.
25753 Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative.
25754 If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.
25755 A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked.
25756 Kind of a hand-held meat pie.
25757 Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component.
25758 Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky.
25759 Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality.
25760 Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors.
25761 It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties.
25762 What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties.
25763 Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado.
25764 This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie.
25765 If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean.
25766 I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints.
25767 It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads.
25768 Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites.
25769 Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there.
25770 The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.
25771 If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.
25772 No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.
25773 After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.
25774 The castle is what drew us here.
25775 It's just the front of a castle with a reading nook in the bottom of the tower.
25776 The 3 year old was impressed as soon as he saw it.
25777 There is also a play area with big activity walls.
25778 It was a little hard for my son to comprehend being quiet while playing.
25779 Getting to the library was confusing with the GPS.
25780 Just follow the signs and park in the garage at the end to the left when you pull in.
25781 Well worth a one time visit.
25782 This place is over priced and the service is horrible.
25783 I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!
25784 Dave at Dave's Ashtanga is the best yoga teacher.
25785 He is kind, considerate, patient and a very nice person.
25786 He will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana.
25787 He is very knowledgeable about different subjects.
25788 What I like best is once he said, "here you can do nothing wrong."
25789 Just a quick update....
25790 Took my parents here for lunch today, and now I have 2 more converts!
25791 If anyone is still sleeping on this place, shame on you; you're really missing out.
25792 Why?
25793 DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order.
25794 Good stuff all around!
25795 I love this place!!!
25796 !fun poker 3 days a week!
25797 !great food!!
25798 !great prices!!
25799 !even better people!!!
25800 !
25801 Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites!
25802 A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week.
25803 We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio.
25804 The staff was super welcoming and friendly.
25805 Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing.
25806 Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu.
25807 We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind.
25808 Drinks:
25809 We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)
25810 Starters:
25811 Signature empanadas: Tasty.
25812 The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside.
25813 Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!
25814 Entrees:
25815 Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING!
25816 Some of the best we've ever had.
25817 The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all.
25818 The flavor was so good!
25819 Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!!
25820 I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas.
25821 Sides:
25822 Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor.
25823 Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go.
25824 Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one!
25825 Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib.
25826 Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week).
25827 Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream.
25828 This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had.
25829 The ice cream was excellent!
25830 Banana burrito: exactly what you'd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious!
25831 I can't wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it.
25832 Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!
25833 Never thought I'd review a supermarket, but since it's tough times for alot of people out there, I'd like to share my 2 cents..
25834 First of all, you don't need a card.
25835 The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.
25836 Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product you're looking for.
25837 It's WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure.
25838 This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!)
25839 snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.
25840 They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.
25841 Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.
25842 I'm Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!
25843 Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B., Robyn N. & Mike C.  They're still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before, including atmosphere, food & table service that are just tops so it's "Woohoo" again for this excellent restaurant!!
25844 :-))
25845 (See previous review for more details.
25846 Weekday Lunch Buffet is still $11.99/$10.79 Sr.)
25847 My daughter loves this place, unfortunately they ran out of money and are closing currently.
25848 DON'T GET TIFFANY UNLESS YOU WANT A SPEEDY EXPERIENCE
25849 Pretty Nail tale with Tiffany-
25850 My 10 year old first mani/pedi
25851 4:35 water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes.
25852 Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair- in 20 minutes.
25853 35 minutes in all.
25854 Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes.
25855 Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her.
25856 She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry.
25857 I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.
25858 She said not 4 coat.
25859 Base 2 color and top is 4 ... well top and base dry fast she said...Owner said" fast or slow it doesn't matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good."
25860 I didn't tip her on purpose...not because I'm poor- I got poor service.
25861 I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicure/manicure.
25862 Very disappointed.
25863 You'd think the owners would realize that all the other patrons saw her take advantage of us.
25864 Get anyone but Tiffany unless you want a quick job!
25865 I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger.
25866 I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddrucker's for the first time, so it was a cherry-poppin' adventure.
25867 Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars.
25868 One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection.
25869 As a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years.
25870 This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce.
25871 Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle.
25872 This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are.
25873 Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as "Mr. Crusty Baker" (see photos).
25874 The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture.
25875 The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a "Burger Party Contact High".
25876 You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality.
25877 True fine dining has come to the Valley.
25878 If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.
25879 And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.
25880 The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.
25881 This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.
25882 The choices for each course are extensive.
25883 At least 6-10 each.
25884 AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.
25885 NONE.
25886 Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.
25887 That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.
25888 But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.
25889 We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.
25890 Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.
25891 The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.
25892 It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.
25893 But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.
25894 If you are a true foodie GO.
25895 I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!
25896 If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all.
25897 I've been coming here for several years.
25898 Can't find my first review.
25899 I guess it was too long ago.
25900 So here comes another one.
25901 The woman who runs the place.
25902 I've forgotten her name.
25903 She is one of the most gracious, friendly, and kind people you can ever hope to meet.
25904 When I go there, sometimes with and some times without my wife, I alway order the small sausage sandwich.
25905 With ajvar and onion, this can't be beat no matter how you my search around.
25906 The sausages, cevap, are delicious and what's unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages.
25907 Simply delicious from all points of view.
25908 They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch.
25909 In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant.
25910 Their soups are do die for.
25911 A very favorite of ours.
25912 I give this a 5 star because in the Bosnian/Jugoslavian cuisine catagory, this can't be beaten.
25913 One more thing worth mentioning:  her Baklava is top of the mark.
25914 It's not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants.
25915 Everything is simply top shelf.
25916 Try the Chicken Parmesan!
25917 It's the best I've ever had?
25918 Quite possibly.
25919 When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week.
25920 Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way.
25921 She calls it as she sees it and I think that's great.
25922 By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order.
25923 I can't comment on the rest of the menu as I've only ordered the Chicken Parm.
25924 Yeah, it's that good.
25925 I parked in the Parking Garage, got my parking ticket validated, and still owed money for parking.
25926 The parking validation was worth $3.00.
25927 The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).
25928 I paid the remaining $3.00 charge, but then, the machine wouldn't give me a receipt.
25929 I am never going back to this location.
25930 It is off my radar from now on.
25931 Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert.
25932 Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you've ever had outside of NY.
25933 As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak.
25934 HO-LY-SHIT.
25935 Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak I've had in a VERY long time - and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly.
25936 Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off.
25937 Ask for yours on the soft roll.
25938 I should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good.
25939 I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book.
25940 The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well.
25941 I dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty.
25942 Perhaps I will try their pizza next time I'm in town.
25943 This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).
25944 I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I don't even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).
25945 I had never seen anything like it!
25946 The giant blocks of soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!
25947 It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).
25948 They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZED!
25949 I got 6 Christmas bath bombs (4 of them for free!)
25950 and 3 travel-sized Snow Fairy shower gels (another Christmas product, and by far one of my favorite Lush products EVER).
25951 I also got some non-holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up (I got a Youki Hi bath bomb, my favorite bath bomb ever, which was sadly discontinued sometime last year).
25952 I also got my first piece of Lush soap (Sexy Peel.
25953 all the citrus just makes me smile when I use this soap.
25954 It's sunshine in your shower)
25955 Since I used to work in the mall I would go into Lush whenever I had a break and get a couple things, and the staff always recognized me :) They even offered me a hand-cream sample one day when I was complaining of dry hands.
25956 I brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies, so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate EVERYTHING in the store!
25957 Literally, she showed us bath bombs, bubble bars, face cleansers and toners, massage bars, and dusting powders.
25958 I was so impressed by her powder demo that I bought some Candy Fluff dusting powder (another item that has since been discontinued.
25959 Vanilla Puff powder is a nice substitute).
25960 This store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Lush store I ever went to, and I will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me, and every time I smell Sexy Peel Soap or SnowFairy Shower Gel I am reminded of that magical day :)
25961 $8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin.
25962 They say it's pricy because they get it local?
25963 It has to have substance to be considered anything.
25964 So whack.
25965 I heard good things about this place, and was looking forward to what the "basement" atmosphere would feel like, lowbrow, a little seedy, etc.
25966 Sadly, too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night.
25967 Flip flops?
25968 UGH..in Winter?
25969 Also, our waiter SUCKED!
25970 He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return.
25971 Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.
25972 We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.
25973 She said me "that couldn't happen" and refused to take it off.
25974 Waitress included autograt.
25975 I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.
25976 This time will be my last.
25977 Yen has amazing sushi.
25978 I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ.
25979 You have to try it to see how amazing it is.
25980 The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan.
25981 The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D
25982 There is only one thing I don't like.
25983 Sometimes it get's to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.
25984 The staff is friendly.
25985 But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel.
25986 The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this.
25987 Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.
25988 Cons:
25989 1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore.
25990 Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it?
25991 Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful!
25992 2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated
25993 3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning.
25994 The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard.
25995 4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it
25996 5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles
25997 6) 80s style tube TV
25998 7) pink 80s decor
25999 8) worn down bed with body dent in it
26000 9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar
26001 10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night
26002 11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning.
26003 pros:
26004 1) location
26005 2) staff smiles and says hi
26006 3) cleaning staff does a good job
26007 Lives up to the local fuss.
26008 Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food.
26009 I've stayed at several hotels in the Hyatt Place chain and they are all great, but this one in particular stands out as having the friendliest, most helpful staff.
26010 I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.
26011 Well, this place was that bad.
26012 First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.
26013 No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?
26014 Come on guys, way too early for that.
26015 It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.
26016 O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.
26017 Seriously?!
26018 Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.
26019 Yuck.
26020 And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.
26021 I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
26022 My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).
26023 So yeah, I don't recommend this place.
26024 Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.
26025 Being a very experienced pho eater, I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent!
26026 That, plus the pho is 50% off, so that must have added to my utility.
26027 Veggies were fresh and the service friendly.
26028 Oh, and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering.
26029 Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer.
26030 Spent a total of $13.61 (including tax) for (2) large bowls of pho, a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls.
26031 Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact.
26032 Will eat here again!
26033 Love their pizza!!
26034 !
26035 Very fresh.
26036 Their cannoli was really good too.
26037 They seem to have great selection of wines.
26038 Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times.
26039 This is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant.
26040 It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.
26041 I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.
26042 Especially the gravlax.
26043 The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.
26044 The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.
26045 The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.
26046 I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.
26047 This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.
26048 Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.
26049 I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?
26050 Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?
26051 Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation.
26052 I was not impressed.
26053 The food was bad & expensive.
26054 The wait is ridiculous.
26055 Don't go.
26056 This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.
26057 It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.
26058 I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!
26059 The store was extremely small, had very little to sell (I didn't even see a camera on display).
26060 They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.
26061 I didn't even recognize any of the former employees.
26062 I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.
26063 I'm sure you will leave disappointed.
26064 Two thumbs down to this lemon!
26065 Always a healthy, fresh meal.
26066 One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer(which is gynormous) and I have them add in some tabbouleh, then cucumbers on the side.
26067 Perfection.
26068 All the pitas, and the seasonal specials are always super good.
26069 Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes.
26070 Otherwise, great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting.
26071 There is something for everyone here, veggies, kids, etc.
26072 If I ever moved from AZ, this is the first place I would come visit upon my return.
26073 Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location, and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungle's fault.
26074 The douche didn't even leave a note - but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita!
26075 It's a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere.
26076 As it is save your money get fast food - McDonald's has less grease.
26077 We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates.
26078 My salad wasn't a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonald's.
26079 My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it.
26080 The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate.
26081 My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart.
26082 Service?
26083 Well let's just pretend this place is 100% do it yourself then it would be OK.
26084 The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order.
26085 Never came back and asked how things were, nothing.
26086 Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldn't have been a problem because she wouldn't have known we were gone.
26087 My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!
26088 !
26089 What kills me is the employees exude an I don't care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because it's obvious by how poorly the place is run that it's OK with them.
26090 It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job 1 fire everyone & start over.
26091 If I could have given them 1/2 a star I would have - we won't be going back.
26092 Free samples?
26093 One dollar churros?
26094 Cheap buys?
26095 Why not.
26096 Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.
26097 I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.
26098 After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.
26099 During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.
26100 Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.
26101 The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.
26102 Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.
26103 The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.
26104 I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.
26105 During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.
26106 I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.
26107 Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so don't settle for this place.
26108 Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.
26109 Taco Bell is a step up!
26110 But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
26111 I now consider myself an Arizonian.
26112 If you drive a lot on the 101 or 51 like I do, you'll get your fair share of chips on your windshield.
26113 You'll also have to replace a windshield like I had to do just recently.
26114 Apparently, chips and cracking windshields  is common in Arizona.
26115 In fact, I seem to recall my insurance agent telling me that insurance companies must provide this coverage in Arizona.
26116 I had a chip repaired about a year ago near the very bottom of the windshield.
26117 Just recently a small, very fine crack started traveling north on the windshield from the repaired chip (a different vendor repaired the chip).
26118 I called these guys over to my house and they said it was too long to fix, so they replaced the whole windshield the next day.
26119 What great service, they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield.
26120 I love everything at Market bistro, but I especially love the salads.
26121 I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side.
26122 That dressing is totally addictive!
26123 The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomato, baby spinach, mozzarella, parmesan and basil pesto sauce.
26124 It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza.
26125 You can get it by the slice at lunch, but have to order a whole pizza for dinner.
26126 I've had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great.
26127 I've not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it.
26128 Had a sandwich here once, with tri-tip with caramelized onions, but it doesn't seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu.
26129 The only thing I haven't loved so far is their Margherita pizza.
26130 Everyone here is always nice and friendly.
26131 I love that it's family-owned and still doing well enough to open another location.
26132 They now have online ordering, which I can't wait to try!
26133 This place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn.
26134 This place is QUIET, CLEAN and for the money, you can't beat this place.
26135 It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe.
26136 This alone saves about $10 per person per day while traveling!
26137 This place has THREE pools (nice if you don't want to hang out near the bar), basketball court, laundry facilities, restaurant, plenty of parking, free wi-fi, full kitchen, great housekeeping service (they cleaned our dirty dishes!
26138 ), and a very courteous front desk staff.
26139 The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes.
26140 But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!
26141 !
26142 This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools, basketball courts and several sets of bbq's on central courtyards.
26143 If you are looking for a fancy place, this isn't it.
26144 But it is an incredible bargain, comfortable, and very quiet.
26145 Always fresh and perfectly prepared.
26146 This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town.
26147 Enough said.
26148 Love this place.
26149 Everyone is fantastic.
26150 The girls up front can be spacey at times but their system is great and the email reminders are perfect.
26151 We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiello's with our Children, 10 and 7.
26152 What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win "dinner on the house" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.
26153 We didn't win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!
26154 We went to check out PNP for their 2 Year Anniversary show and were extremely impressed!
26155 Space 55 is the most charming space that I never would've known existed had it not been for this show being promoted on Yelp!
26156 The actors were amazing and we really were in awe the entire time we watched this 30 minute film being created right in front of us!
26157 I'd heard of Comedy Improv, but Movie Improv?
26158 I had no clue...
26159 Special shout outs to Mark J and Jenn H (our very own Phoenix yelpers) who did an incredible job on Saturday night.
26160 Congrats again, PNP, on your 2 year anniversary!
26161 I look forward to attending future performances for sure!
26162 WOW!!!
26163 practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores.
26164 Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!
26165 YIKES!!
26166 Its a good thing that this place it a far drive for me - cuz it could spell trouble.
26167 If you ever have a craving for a real delight and want to really 'enjoy a silent moment'.....try one of their coconut, lemon or dark chocolate cupcakes.
26168 Honestly I didnt care how many calories are in them....I was weak in the knees.
26169 There is standing room only in this shop  - literally I think my bathroom is bigger -but a big thumbs up for the cupcakes, and kudos on their packaging!!.
26170 (its definitely built into the pricing!)
26171 I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan.
26172 I don't like Hallmark holiday's.
26173 We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening.
26174 I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience.
26175 I just love this place.
26176 My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out.
26177 Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine.
26178 This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.
26179 I did not get ill from the food here
26180 However....
26181  $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ??
26182 ?
26183 I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
26184 nope.
26185 Thought we might split one.
26186 nope.
26187 My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.
26188 $29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!).
26189 I only had $40 (only ?)
26190 Left the waitress $5.
26191 Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.
26192 ..the fries were good tho.
26193 Habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as Scottsdale.
26194 If you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price, try out Habaneros.
26195 I am addicted to their chipotle sauce.
26196 You can find it in almost every item there.
26197 Try out the Shrimp or Fish tacos, they are delicious.
26198 Sometimes the food takes a little while to cook (and there could be a line).
26199 So be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break.
26200 The salsa is not as spicy as I would like, but I am splitting hairs at this point.
26201 Go try Habaneros, you wont be disappointed.
26202 Its a nice change from every unoriginal, corporate restaurant you find in Scottsdale.
26203 I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is.
26204 Wrong.
26205 The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery.
26206 Fuck it...stick to Slices.
26207 I LOVE this place.
26208 Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere.
26209 Great variety, great spices, great presentation, great menu.
26210 Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on.
26211 I think I would love everything on the menu.
26212 Can't wait to go back and try them all.
26213 Love It!
26214 !
26215 I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.
26216 I am just in love with it.
26217 Everytime I go to the US, I have to go there.
26218 Cheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).
26219 The meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!
26220 !
26221 Always clean and fresh with friendly staff.
26222 Healthy fast food .....
26223 Just wish that we had it in Canada !
26224 !
26225 Fresh and delicious.
26226 My boss took us here for a little Holiday lunch the other day and i have been dreaming about the burger ever since!
26227 Seriously, the term "cheeseburger" doesn't even to justice to the masterpiece they brought me!
26228 And the parmesan and truffle oil fries were amazing, too!
26229 The decor is kind of cool, sort of an American Teddy Roosevelt feel... Grand old pictures, deer head, and dark wood mixed with high ceilings and light colors so it doesn't feel all heavy.
26230 Ok, back to the food...
26231 The burger has applewood smoked bacon and grilled onions mixed into the patty.
26232 It is incredibly juicy without being greasy!
26233 They top it with Havarti cheese, place it on a buttered grilled brioche bun, and serve it with a couple of different sauces... One was like a garlic butter type of sauce and the other was like a horseradish mayo.
26234 I ate every single bite and didn't care that i was stuffed to the gills or looked like a pig in front of my co-workers!
26235 To leave any bit of that on the plate would have been a travesty!
26236 I can't wait to take hubby here for lunch (dinner would be wayyyyyyy too expensive).
26237 Gross, plain and simple!
26238 I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.
26239 What a waste of money!
26240 What a great way to spend Easter morning!
26241 After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies.
26242 More than the kids could carry.
26243 Plenty of photo ops.
26244 Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.)
26245 we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot.
26246 We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket.
26247 I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal.
26248 Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home.
26249 Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home.
26250 Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..
26251 NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!
26252 !
26253 I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.
26254 First, they provide us with John McCain.
26255 Then, Jan Brewer.
26256 Then they crap SB 1070 all over us, which we didn't even vote on.
26257 I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people.
26258 I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful.
26259 Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they can't wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.
26260 I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.
26261 Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores.
26262 This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!
26263 Simply magnificent.
26264 Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States.
26265 I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta.
26266 The rice and beans are the best I've eaten.
26267 Tacos are simple and delicious.
26268 The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more "exotic" things like the lengua and menudo!
26269 You must go!
26270 One of the best dining experiences we had in Phoenix.
26271 And what a surprise, without Yelp we would have never found this wonderful "hole in the wall" in a space the width of a bowling alley.
26272 I had The Italian which was Pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes & marinara wrapped in a delicious pastry shell.
26273 Imagine a gourmet hot pocket.
26274 Mmmmmmmmmmmm
26275 Cafe Monarch is more than a restaurant - it's an experience.
26276 If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show.
26277 I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.
26278 As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone.
26279 There is no menu provided to pick things from.
26280 This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it.
26281 If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time.
26282 But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.
26283 I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place.
26284 She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter.
26285 Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc.
26286 etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.
26287 For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile H's review.
26288 She described everything perfectly.
26289 This is my new favorite place in the valley.
26290 I can't wait to go back!
26291 Highly highly highly recommend this experience!!
26292 !
26293 I have been coming to Lai Lai's for many years now and have never had a bad experience!
26294 The food is always great, and if you mess it up you have no one to blame except yourself since you decide what all you want in your bowl lol.
26295 Sometimes I don't make it in for a year or so but the staff always remembers me and that makes me feel very much at home.
26296 Lai Lai's is great!
26297 I've only been here once, for breakfast, but I was very impressed and hope to make it back again soon!
26298 I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food, service, ambiance, and value, or any combination of these.
26299 Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews.
26300 This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away.
26301 Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.
26302 When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers.
26303 Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table.
26304 We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.
26305 Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started.
26306 We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying "excuse me" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.
26307 I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready.
26308 Our relief was short lived however.
26309 After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table.
26310 We ordered wine and water.
26311 Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.
26312 We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.
26313 Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout.
26314 When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up.
26315 When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us.
26316 When our server said she could take the fries back "to keep them warm until our trout was ready", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.
26317 Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived.
26318 As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day.
26319 The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.
26320 As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House.
26321 There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable.
26322 Spend your hard earned money somewhere else
26323 This place is so cool
26324 i was startled to find that Tempe has something like this
26325 It reminded me of the C.A.T.
26326 in Eugene.
26327 There are soo many bike parts, and tools, frames of all kinds
26328 from what i've learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here, or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debt
26329 i came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest, and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect, now i can get another
26330 the dude running the operation didnt charge me a thing
26331 so i left like a $1 in the tip jar
26332 it's such a priveledge to have something like this for the community, i just hope enough ppl reinvest their time into it so it can exist for generations of cyclists to come.
26333 Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.
26334 5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS
26335 This is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers.
26336 Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails.
26337 If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one.
26338 This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix.
26339 5 stars?
26340 Definitely!
26341 Upon walking in, everything from the atmosphere, decor and staff was warm and inviting.
26342 We each ordered a 3 course meal, and agreed on different selections.
26343 The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted 8 dishes that night.
26344 8 amazingly unique and delicious dishes.
26345 We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly).
26346 Pretty much everything was "my favorite," and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly.
26347 It was pretty quiet on the night we visited... if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo.
26348 Like, now.
26349 Really delicious breakfast burritos!
26350 They are true Mexican-style!
26351 I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla.
26352 They are inexpensive and really big!
26353 I'm so glad I work a mile from this place!
26354 I go at least once a week!
26355 Had my Snaaz 5k walk for education very beautiful park!!!
26356 Clean and would be perfect for walking a dog!
26357 There's lots of parking and also there is a desert in downtown Phoenix how nice!
26358 Real Arizona feel!
26359 I would definitely take my parents or my aunt for a nice walk on a fall morning :)
26360 I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.
26361 I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.
26362 Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.
26363 I won't be returning because I am concerned about health violations.
26364 Pros:
26365 Quick service
26366 Cheaper than the spa, salon
26367 Cons:
26368 Improper cleaning of foot baths.
26369 I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.
26370 They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.
26371 (I did let her know)
26372 The foot massage was more like a foot beating.
26373 About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.
26374 It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again.
26375 The sent in the shop is of fake nails.
26376 If everyone has on a mask, I would like one to.
26377 Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and it's 1/2 off during happy hour.
26378 I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi!
26379 Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!
26380 I've been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.
26381 I had the "Friggin Chicken", which was friggin delicious.
26382 The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio.
26383 This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.
26384 The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.
26385 Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.
26386 I'll be going back to sample the beverages very soon.
26387 On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your "Fast Food Coffee" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.
26388 If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out.
26389 Ugh.
26390 I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.
26391 1.
26392 The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers.
26393 2.
26394 Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising.
26395 3.
26396 Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce.
26397 The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought.
26398 I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me.
26399 Not there right now.
26400 We had read about this place on  Yelp and a local had highly recommended it as well.
26401 It is located in an office building and not easy to find unless you know in advance that it is in the back of a big office building with a big parking lot.
26402 I will preface this by saying that we had just eaten the night before at a highly regarded Scottsdale restaurant in which the service was awful.
26403 Therefore, this place won a lot of points with the 4 of us immediately because the service was outstanding from start to finish.
26404 The restaurant itself is huge and it is beautifully decorated and immaculate.
26405 You walk in and they have a huge open fire spit BBQ chickens and Beef.
26406 For starters we had a  Caesar Salad--a shrimp cocktail--a bit pricey and just okay, and a good house salad.
26407 I ordered their simply grilled fish of the day which was Swordfish with Guacomole on top and a corn butter on the side served with rice.
26408 It was a good portion and it was delicious.
26409 My wife had Salmon on a plank which was also very good.
26410 One of our friends had Short Ribs with Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce and grits.
26411 The portion was huge and he raved about the dish.
26412 Our other friend had the Duck Breast and it was very good.
26413 We had a nice wine recommended by our waitress that was reasonably priced and very good.
26414 The whole experience was excellent and we will go again when we come back to Scottsdale.
26415 Love this gym.
26416 Not many know it's here..lunch time is the best to get in.
26417 I've been a member since Feb of 2009.
26418 While the trainers are nice, it's a revolving door.
26419 You are better off at this gym if you know what you're doing vs. needing 1-to-1 attention.
26420 Since LA Fitness just purchased PURE, this will only increase I imagine.
26421 Pretty disappointed that they no longer do monthly 're-programs'...
26422 But the gym itself is worth the monthly fee.
26423 If you're looking for a place to be left alone to workout - this is it.
26424 Our go to pizza place!
26425 Don't see how they could improve in any area.
26426 Customer service is excellent, immaculately clean and the food is PERFECTION!
26427 Hands down the best cupcakes in the Phoenix market.
26428 Tammie Coe comes in second with the coconut but sometimes it's not as fresh as it could be at LGO.
26429 Milk chocolate is great, taste a sprinkle - it's really chocolate not wax.
26430 I had salted caramel it was wonderful.
26431 Dark chocolate is decadent.
26432 I did try the red velvet and it was good but I'm done trying to understand red velvet.
26433 I just don't get it.
26434 I had a great experience with this company today.
26435 They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.
26436 He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.
26437 He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue.
26438 The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.
26439 I would definitely use them again in the future.
26440 I can not believe that pizza could be this good.
26441 I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.
26442 They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that.
26443 I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good.
26444 This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.
26445 We've been to more than a few and can attest to that.
26446 Pastor Jeff not only knows everyone's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.
26447 The congregation is like one big family.
26448 Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it's acted upon.
26449 If you're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don't act what they preach, you'd better check this one out.
26450 Services every Sunday at 9:30am.
26451 Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does.
26452 The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office.
26453 They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist!
26454 I would recommend this office to anyone who has children.
26455 Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!
26456 So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood.
26457 The space is much larger than it appears from the street, and is broken up really well into comfortable areas.
26458 The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel.
26459 Nice large bar as well.
26460 Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year.
26461 Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right.
26462 The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite.
26463 The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket.
26464 The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain.
26465 I wanted an order to take home!
26466 Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture.
26467 Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned.
26468 The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood.
26469 Great job, Sam Fox!
26470 Thanks to Chris L's first review, OTFM has been on my list of places to go for quite some time.
26471 Unfortunately, I just can't seem to get my act together on Saturday mornings.
26472 Today was the day.
26473 I was ready by 9 (am, not pm)!
26474 After a quick stop at the ATM, we were there, Yelp canvas bags in hand, and not disappointed.
26475 I had to get that chocolate cherry bread from Phoenician Bakery.
26476 I sampled an itsy, bitsy little piece and it was still like heaven exploded in my mouth.
26477 We also purchased zucchini bread, honey (which I've already mixed with some mascarpone cheese and slathered on strawberries), grapefruit marmalade (yum), dates, and fresh flowers.
26478 The breakfast burritos from Gil's Taste of Taos were some damn good burritos.
26479 Saving for next time...fresh produce (the lines were already long for McClendon's and I'm not one to wait for veggies) and everything else I wanted (like tamales).
26480 We saw our own Gabi K's other half wandering down the street too...he looked so lost without her:(  Hope he brought her some flowers.
26481 Ugh!
26482 !
26483 A 25 min wait greeted us before anyone recognized our presence.
26484 We were offered complientary champaigne in consideration.
26485 Who drinks champainge?
26486 ?
26487 We were allowed to order wine prior to hearing of the chef's feast, which offers a wine pairing.
26488 That's dumb.
26489 We ordered a meat/cheese plate.
26490 It contained head cheese.
26491 Hmmmm.
26492 Overpriced and oversalted.
26493 30 min later our salads came.
26494 The salads were ok and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.
26495 35 min later our main course came.
26496 Overcooked, uneventful, lame.
26497 I can't drink alcohol and ordered water.
26498 Twice I was left w/ no water for extended periods.
26499 Both times I was foced to ask for water.
26500 There were no hand towels in the unisex bathroom.
26501 It's no fun to dry your hands using toilet paper.
26502 The "best" part was saved for last.
26503 Quiessence automatically adds an 18% gratuity, which is OK assuming the service is at least adequate.
26504 It wasn't.
26505 Further, as our waiter dropped the bill, he explained the 18% "goes to the house" and anything additional we might addd, though not required, is most appreciated.
26506 Egad....why does the house need a service charge w/ the magnificent margins they charge for their normal food service?
26507 And why do they put their staff in the position of shaking down their patrons for tips?
26508 Although it's a very nice, calming setting, I found myself wanting to leave after the first appy.
26509 Food, service and ancillary were simply terrible.
26510 Stay away.
26511 You'll spend your $175 for 2 much better most anywhere else.
26512 Amazing thrift store!
26513 The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude.
26514 They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need.
26515 Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new.
26516 Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing.
26517 For sure will go back!!
26518 !
26519 Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):
26520 10 Food
26521 9 Service
26522 10 Atmosphere
26523 8 Value
26524 As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food.
26525 Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef it's my favorite.
26526 The location is perfect as it's only a quick two or three minute drive from my house.
26527 Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.
26528 The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent.
26529 I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food!
26530 It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy.
26531 I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best I've tasted.
26532 The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people.
26533 We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week!
26534 It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls.
26535 I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession.
26536 I try to eat there as often as I can :)
26537 The bar and wait staff couldn't be better at this location of PF Chang's.
26538 The food and service is better than any other 'Chang's' country-wide.
26539 We just moved here from NY and missed our "local hangout".
26540 The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.
26541 We go at least once per week for wonder food, drink, and company with the staff and other patrons.
26542 Thank you Clint, Gerry, Nate, Kyle, Nick, Angie, et al.
26543 This is a family owned local restaurant at it's best.
26544 If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses, you should definitely give this one a try.
26545 They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good.
26546 I love the breakfast burrito.
26547 (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage).
26548 I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area.
26549 Thanks for helping me to find Valley Eyecare Center, fellow Yelpers!
26550 I visited their office as a new patient and knew from the moment I walked in that it was going to be a positive experience.
26551 The receptionist was  friendly, the office was modern and clean, and the wait was super-short (~3 mins).
26552 I was impressed with care that was provided and didn't feel rushed when working with Dr. Eric Clyde or his assistant.
26553 The three words that come to mind when thinking of this office are: professional, prompt, and accurate.
26554 My visit was for a contact lens fitting, so no comment on their frame selection / service.
26555 A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive.
26556 The oatmeal horchata is tasty!
26557 THE torta is really an experience!
26558 BBQ Chicken plate is excellent!
26559 My wife says that the half order is fine.
26560 Usually take orders to go and food is ready on-time!
26561 We eat here on a monthly basis.
26562 Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy.
26563 He will tell you what you need or what can wait.
26564 This place is worth going to!
26565 It will save you tons of money!
26566 When we first got here I felt disappointed until I realized the zoo is much larger than it first appears.
26567 Particularly worthy of checking out - the lions and tigers.
26568 Also do not pass up the monkey walk.
26569 The little squirrel monkeys are fun to watch.
26570 Be sure to shell out the extra bucks to feed the giraffes.
26571 It's a unique experience to be so close to these large, yet gentle, creatures.
26572 Definitely my favorite part of my visit.
26573 Visit Date: 11/19/09
26574 Decided to call CityWide based on positive online reviews.
26575 We suspected a slab leak and a really expensive repair.
26576 Robert showed up within 20 minutes, determined the source of the leak within 5 minutes, and it turned out to be something really simple and inexpensive.
26577 He repaired it with a brand new line, we paid, and he left within a half hour of us calling CityWide.
26578 Very professional, friendly, and efficient!
26579 Would definitely recommend CityWide for anyone's plumbing needs.
26580 Potbelly, you have been handed the torch.
26581 It was a good ride Jimmy Johns, but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home.
26582 Its not you, its me.
26583 I promise.
26584 I love italian-style subs.
26585 The Wreck at Potbelly is fantastic.
26586 The Wreck salad is also great (for a salad).
26587 This place is my new go to sub shack.
26588 Okay, this just might sum it up...
26589 I LOVE YOGURTLAND WITH ALL OF MY HEART!
26590 Go get some yogurt, the end.
26591 No but seriously, do go.
26592 :) All of these yogurt places have been popping up everywhere the past couple years, and when Mojo opened up at the Biltmore I loved it, but it was far away.
26593 Then, yogurtland opened up right next to where I live and i discovered it WAS BETTER!
26594 Sooo many flavors, and they change a few of them out every once in awhile.
26595 They have all the normal yogurt toppings, plus white chocolate sauce, chocolate sauce, and caramel sauce.
26596 Hello?
26597 Isn't this supposed to be healthy?
26598 Haha, it actually is if you take advantage of their freshly cut fruit.
26599 I just love it.
26600 I took my brother and he is the first person I've seen to grab the biggest cup they have, I asked him why and he said, "It's so good, I can take some home and put it in the freezer for later."
26601 My favorite is pistachio yogurt with gummie bears!
26602 Record is 5 times in one week... message me if you've beat that.
26603 And then it all changed...
26604 I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time.
26605 So, where do I start.
26606 After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to "walk-in" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly.
26607 They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP.
26608 I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am.
26609 Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me.
26610 By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place.
26611 I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice.
26612 Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours!
26613 I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point.
26614 What could she have said really?
26615 The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in.
26616 When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart.
26617 Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake.
26618 When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about.
26619 I was quite appalled.
26620 I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart.
26621 My final analysis: In my opinion, don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you.
26622 What an exciting time.
26623 I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon.
26624 There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups.
26625 It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed.
26626 I ended up with Birthday Cake (that's right, there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt, life IS good), Cafe Latte, and the divine Original Tart.
26627 After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl.
26628 I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness.
26629 Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel.
26630 The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant.
26631 With a cute garden in the back.
26632 I had already eaten so didn't intend on a 2nd breakfast.
26633 But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.
26634 It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.
26635 Everything tasted so fresh.
26636 For the price you get to drink all you want.
26637 And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.
26638 The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.
26639 Will definitely return when I'm in town.
26640 This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town.
26641 It's something different that I think real "Foodies" will enjoy.
26642 Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped, it's worth going to over and over again.
26643 I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious.
26644 Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty.
26645 But if you're ever in a rush, a good thing about this place, is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive.
26646 Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee!
26647 I'm seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup!
26648 All of the products are top notch though and who doesn'tlike creme brulee?
26649 Communists maybe?
26650 Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.
26651 I love this place, sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good!
26652 Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS!!
26653 Good God get the Sizzling ninja, top that off with a fried egg, and pineapple, get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA (which comes standard btw) AMAZING!
26654 Don't waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop, i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did!
26655 And for those wondering they don't serve pirates (some will understand this fact)  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS!!
26656 I joke they don't throw them but you may get some for free (really though)!
26657 Awesome loose leaf tea spot in the North Phoenix area.
26658 You can have a cup/pot of tea in-house, or buy a variety of teas to go.
26659 HUGE selection of loose leaf teas.
26660 If you're a tea fan, a visit to Souvia is a must-do.
26661 I have eaten here several times before...and I don't think I have ever left upset,  I've always enjoyed my meals, but this time I can honestly  say that I enjoyed all of my courses!
26662 I was with a group of four other girls.
26663 We all started off with the amuse.
26664 It was some sort of sous vide duck on toast.
26665 It was really good.
26666 Next we had our choice out of four starters...I along with three other girls had the sauteed scallop.
26667 So beautiful!
26668 Four out of five of us ordered the beef tenderloin.
26669 It melted in my mouth...It was perfectly cooked.
26670 The only bad thing is that I wanted more!
26671 Finally, you get to chose from four desserts.
26672 I don't like sweets, so I always bring it home to the kids.
26673 But, they are so beautiful!
26674 Now for the price...my meal was only $13 for everything!
26675 It doesn't get any better than that.
26676 I also ordered the orangecello for an extra $3.
26677 Well worth it!
26678 Only sad part is that we were the only table there...Makes me sad!
26679 Everyone is missing out.
26680 Our server also took us on a tour of the school afterwards!
26681 I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint!
26682 These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3" square) brownies you will find!
26683 I'm tellin' ya!
26684 TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except they're taking their own holiday break right now, so you'll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix!
26685 Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!
26686 !
26687 No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!
26688 I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since.
26689 I've tried a lot of other "great" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys.
26690 The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one!
26691 I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself.
26692 And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and " He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows".
26693 I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it!
26694 Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley.
26695 Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to.
26696 By far the best asian market in the entire valley!
26697 I first discovered Lee Lee's tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley.
26698 Amazing selection from produce, meats, and asian.
26699 The staff is super nice.
26700 Never have had a poor experience in all the years.
26701 Shelves are clean and organized.
26702 Prices are great too.
26703 This was definitely the best meal of this year's holiday trip....
26704 The Kale Caesar!
26705 is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic.
26706 We loved the melted Scamorza cheese.
26707 I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree, accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette.
26708 The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.
26709 A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.
26710 I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.
26711 My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.
26712 Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.
26713 Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar.
26714 We always get excited about an original dessert dish, and this one did not disappoint.
26715 Service was top notch all the way, also.
26716 Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment.
26717 The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice.
26718 I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in.
26719 He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present.
26720 Fine.
26721 The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe).
26722 No one introduced either of them.
26723 Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns.
26724 He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness.
26725 It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off.
26726 He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script.
26727 He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does.
26728 Awful awful.
26729 Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results.
26730 I had to call them and the gal that answered said, "no one called you with the results yet?
26731 : NO!!
26732 Will not see this doctor again.
26733 Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable, not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment.
26734 I honestly just got home from visiting Super Farm!
26735 I headed out their way because I wanted to try their milk - we are trying to spend our $$ on local businesses.
26736 It was great to actually speak to the people who raise the cows and see the cows with my own eyes!
26737 We ended up staying for about two hours!
26738 Everyone was so friendly.
26739 We bought our gallon of milk ($3.49) and some butter ($4.99) and then stayed for lunch.
26740 Chef Matt - I hope I didn't forget his name!- introduced himself while we were buying milk and we decided to stay for lunch .
26741 The kids split a kid's cheeseburger and I had the chicken salad - sandwich.
26742 It was fantastic!
26743 !
26744 After lunch we visited the baby cows, the goats, and then stopped and had a big glass of flavored milk ($1 each - grape for my 2 yr old daughter and chocolate for my 4 yr old son).
26745 Everyone is so nice here - my children LOVED it and did not want to leave.
26746 Worth the 40-ish minute drive out there.
26747 (We live in South Phoenix)
26748 We use yelp.com anytime we are out of town and want a great place to eat.
26749 We weren't disappointed again...Ramiro's is great...generous portions, great prices, huge selection...you can even get most everything ala carte.
26750 We were visiting my parents and told them about Ramiro's.
26751 They said they have driven by many, many times...not any more!
26752 I had the biggest, best carnitas chimichanga I have ever seen.
26753 Can't wait to come back and have the taco salad.
26754 Don't drive by this place!
26755 The best Gelato ever...EVER!!!
26756 Yeah I said it.
26757 What?
26758 Seriously, the best customer service I've experienced since the '70s.
26759 By the time I ordered I was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything - easily 20 different favors to sample and choose from.
26760 My favorites are the dark chocolate, salted caramel, peach champagne, and black cherry.
26761 We've visited multiple times and have never been disappointed - same quality service and deliciousness every time.
26762 My kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit - they appreciate their customers.
26763 If your looking for your next vice, check this place out!
26764 I'm sorry.
26765 You're too busy to look up my club card information?
26766 Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?
26767 I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card.
26768 And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me?
26769 Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up.
26770 It always takes 5-10 seconds at most!
26771 Great customer service.
26772 Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.
26773 Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem.
26774 Just the one.
26775 Still a great place to eat.
26776 A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..
26777 It is good..
26778 I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!
26779 their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews.
26780 I like it a lot too!
26781 I plan to order more tamales for the holidays!
26782 hurrah!
26783 After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.
26784 * Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.
26785 * French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells.
26786 so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.
26787 * Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.
26788 Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!
26789 I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.
26790 So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!
26791 The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.
26792 The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful.
26793 Walked in during late lunch hour.
26794 Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins.
26795 When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it.
26796 Got no apology.
26797 Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away.
26798 You can't pay me to go back here.
26799 The waiters are rude.
26800 I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident.
26801 They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly.
26802 They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool.
26803 I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.
26804 I am basing this review solely on the Cauliflower Soup.
26805 Holy Heaven in a cup.
26806 We had Zupas cater lunch at the office, so I can't speak to the actual restaurant.
26807 But man, I wish I had a bucket of that soup.
26808 When a man falls in love, it's a special thing.
26809 Not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening.
26810 Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul.
26811 It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy.
26812 Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy.
26813 I heard all the hype..."best pizza in the country", "Oprah says it's the best", "The Food Network hypes it up", "Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus".
26814 Ok, I made up the last one.
26815 My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home.
26816 Sometimes, he'd even fly in.
26817 It had to be good, right?
26818 Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype.
26819 I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait.
26820 Is any pizza worth three hours?
26821 That's a personal judgment call.
26822 That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal.
26823 I digress.
26824 I've been preparing for this trip.
26825 I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays!
26826 Perfect.
26827 Tonight, I dined with my parents.
26828 My favorite dining companions.
26829 We sat down in the very intimate dining space.
26830 No wait at all.
26831 Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays.
26832 Fine by me.
26833 The decor is nice.
26834 Simple, with a classic cucina feel.
26835 The brick oven is the star of this place.
26836 Clearly.
26837 We ordered some bread to get started.
26838 It came with a little cup of high end olive oil.
26839 Fantastic!
26840 The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this.
26841 The pizza is phenomenal.
26842 We ordered two pizzas (for three people).
26843 One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde.
26844 This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza .
26845 All three styles were phenomenal.
26846 The winner of the three was the Margherita.
26847 The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil.
26848 The Rosa was unique, and also delicious.
26849 The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion.
26850 The Biancoverde was much more complex.
26851 Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese.
26852 Very tasty.
26853 It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor.
26854 Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest.
26855 Not here.
26856 I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect.
26857 Chewy, crispy, and full of happy!
26858 Take it from me....this place is worth the hype.
26859 Look at the reviews from other Yelpers.
26860 Even the picky ones love this place.
26861 Maybe it's true.
26862 Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus.
26863 Sure as hell tastes like it.
26864 Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless.
26865 Worth the 3 hour wait?
26866 YES.
26867 Bring all your friends here?
26868 YES.
26869 Will I guarantee the awesome?
26870 YES.
26871 #300
26872 I'm usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color.
26873 I chose this place because of their good prices- 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars.
26874 The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions.
26875 I love their food.
26876 Everything has been delicious, though my favorite is "Bahn Mi" inspired fish sandwich.
26877 Get it with a side of kale salad!
26878 I crave their jalapeno fried rice.
26879 AMAZING!
26880 had a "cap steak" for the first time.
26881 Best steak i have ever had.
26882 Would recommend to anyone.
26883 this place is amazing!
26884 So many flavors to choose from!!!!
26885 I LOVE this place!!!
26886 !
26887 Postino's in Gilbert was stunning!
26888 Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.
26889 Food and wine were excellent as expected!
26890 What another great addition to the Postino family!
26891 Loved it!!!!
26892 !
26893 Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment.
26894 Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt.
26895 A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same.
26896 ADORABLE PLACE!
26897 Wraps, Pastas, Salads, Pizza, Gelato, Pastries, Sodas and Such
26898 Super darling place that makes you feel so comfortable.
26899 Looks like they have computers to use (i don't know if there is a charge).
26900 The inside is precious, decorated to the T-- not a single spot was missed.
26901 Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza.
26902 It was really good.
26903 The place is just so darn adorable; it's hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH.
26904 Get it?
26905 I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month.
26906 Best Asian food in Phoenix however it is now closed
26907 We love Roys.
26908 The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful.The ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a Saturday.
26909 My water glass is constantly being refilled because the people Roy's employ are totally on the ball.
26910 We have dined here 8+ times over the past 2 years and have never had a mediocre meal.
26911 They also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server.
26912 The wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktails.We have dined here on both special occasions and regular Saturday nights.
26913 It is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous JW Marriott.
26914 ...definitely in my top three Phoenix area restaurants.
26915 Stopped in for the first time at PV Burger Company tonight.
26916 It was quiet, only one table when I got there around 6:20pm.
26917 Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke; it came out to just over 9 bucks.
26918 The burger came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber (???
26919 ), pickled red onions, and thousand island.
26920 It was DELICIOUS.
26921 Beautifully toasted bun, great char on the meat.
26922 The pickled onions were a nice touch.
26923 The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt, which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall (good memories).
26924 I got a refill on my coke before I left, so I don't know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas.
26925 I asked and it was no problem.
26926 My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food, a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus (with actual descriptions of the menu items I'm sure, unlike the chalkboard on the wall), which I would have liked.
26927 I probably would have gotten an add-on for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter.
26928 Oh well, now I know for next time, because there will definitely be a next time in the near future :)
26929 IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!
26930 !
26931 My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).
26932 This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's.
26933 We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son.
26934 He started to fuss on and off during dinner.
26935 Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining.
26936 That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children.
26937 Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself.
26938 We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy.
26939 Just go home without dinner and pay the bill.
26940 Of course, she herself has no children.
26941 To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting.
26942 We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.
26943 07/09/2008
26944 Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.
26945 I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.
26946 I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.
26947 I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.
26948 I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!
26949 We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.
26950 ???
26951 We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.
26952 The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused.
26953 I had to POINT at the options.
26954 YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.
26955 The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.
26956 They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????
26957 I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.
26958 Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.
26959 I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.
26960 Waste of time and money, I will not return.
26961 Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!
26962 Yuck.
26963 Oh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.
26964 I keep wanting to like this place.
26965 I want to support a local business, and yet....
26966 Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!
26967 Excellent!
26968 ), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).
26969 WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.
26970 "You can't do that."
26971 "What?
26972 Play cards?
26973 It's not gambling."
26974 (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).
26975 "The owners don't allow it."
26976 "They don't allow it?
26977 It's a matching game."
26978 "No.
26979 You'll have to put it away."
26980 Now.
26981 I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).
26982 However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.
26983 I KNOW I should've just left then.
26984 Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!
26985 ).
26986 A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.
26987 Didn't bother with the cards this time.
26988 The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.
26989 They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.
26990 I'd kind of like the "Restaurant Impossible" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.
26991 I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over.
26992 This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen.
26993 The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant.
26994 The food is horribly boring and has no flavor.
26995 I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing!
26996 We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef).
26997 In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating.
26998 One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well.
26999 The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill.
27000 Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best.
27001 Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location.
27002 However, I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16.
27003 Yes, yes.
27004 It is Barney's and I understand the premium pricing.
27005 What I question is how Fred's scored only $$.
27006 I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading, when Oregano's is also $$.
27007 Just sayin'.
27008 This place is classic goodness!
27009 Everything tastes rich and fresh!
27010 Has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare.
27011 The food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks!
27012 In a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office.
27013 An inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley!
27014 A hole in the wall in South Phoenix....
27015 I order: The "Betty Boop" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast.
27016 Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and I'm a happy girl.
27017 Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing.
27018 I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.
27019 It's one of my family's favorites!!
27020 !
27021 TRY IT!!!
27022 !
27023 The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.
27024 I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.
27025 The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.
27026 I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.
27027 Can't go wrong.
27028 This place sucks!!
27029 I moved to the valley and have yet to find that "go to " chinese spot, sooo I decided to give this spot a try.
27030 I called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order, always fresh.
27031 So I picked up my food, and what do you know, I got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp.
27032 WTF??!!
27033 I give this place 2 thumbs down and I would not eat here if I was hungry as a hostage :(
27034 I really hate to do this.
27035 This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.
27036 The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).
27037 My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.
27038 China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.
27039 Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.
27040 One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.
27041 I don't get it.
27042 This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.
27043 The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.
27044 After a long week of being trapped in a conference room, I really really needed to be outside.
27045 Pinnacle Peak helped to put me back in my normal happy place.
27046 This spot is very popular and can get really crowded on weekends.
27047 I wanted to enjoy a little bit of solitude, so I arrived as the sun was rising.
27048 Good choice - there were only a few others around on this chilly morning.
27049 The 3+ mile trail is an out-and-back route, with enough ups and downs to keep it interesting.
27050 Like a stairmaster, but better because you aren't in a gym squished next to some icky sweaty person.
27051 The well-maintained path is packed gravel, so you can spend more time enjoying the beautiful views rather focusing on where you are stepping.
27052 For those that want to take their time and learn a little, there are small signs along the route that label various plants, as well as two rest points with markers to tell you the names of the mountains you can see in the distance.
27053 Get up!
27054 Go outside!
27055 You will love it as much as I do.
27056 Love it and love the GF menu.
27057 It's amazing how many dishes they have
27058 Excellent service and great quality.
27059 I will always bring my alterations here.
27060 Had an emergency and needed a hem done in a couple of hours and they had it sone sooner than expected!
27061 Cary is one of the most honest and knowledgeable mechanics I've ever been to.
27062 He is caring to all of his customer's and his shop takes the utmost care with the cars they work on.
27063 I cannot recommend him strongly enough!
27064 The interior is very industrial and charming; furnished with iron beams, brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs.
27065 The lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets.
27066 There is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because you're distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display.
27067 I've never had a meal that wasn't awesome here.
27068 I usually find myself eating the simple but delicious Liberty Joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a home-made snicker-doodle.
27069 Whatever you end up ordering, I'm sure you'll end up enjoying Liberty Market as greatly and as frequently as I do!
27070 I love happy hour!
27071 3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY!
27072 This place has one of, if not, THE BEST!!!
27073 $4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas, YES!!
27074 Plus $4 or $5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos?
27075 YES!!!
27076 And if you really want a treat...$9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos.
27077 Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices.
27078 Place is friendly, bar plays classic rock, most patrons seem to be regulars...once you eat there, you will be too!
27079 Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair.
27080 I've been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years, the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food, atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant.
27081 Consistantly great.
27082 The owner, Andrew, always makes a point to great everybody.
27083 New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality.
27084 Regular Menu is a bit pricey, portions could be larger, but food is great.
27085 We went here for a family dinner.
27086 Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious.
27087 We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.
27088 No problems so far.
27089 Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.
27090 I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.
27091 Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.
27092 We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!
27093 I could not believe it, I was shocked.
27094 A guest should NEVER be treated this way.
27095 If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal.
27096 The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.
27097 They are served with bean dip and salsa.
27098 I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many "salsas" don't even contain!
27099 To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.
27100 The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.
27101 They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.
27102 It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!
27103 Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.
27104 Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.
27105 Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.
27106 Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.
27107 After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.
27108 More waiting...the table eats, minus one.
27109 When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.
27110 It was delicious, but overpriced.
27111 The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.
27112 They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.
27113 They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.
27114 Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.
27115 Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back.
27116 Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant.
27117 Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us.
27118 We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry!
27119 Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant...
27120 It was spectacular!!
27121 The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face!
27122 Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun.
27123 The food is absolutely amazing!!
27124 We split the "IGNACIO" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa "Costillas" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious!
27125 We tried the House Margarita the "Distrito" and the white "Mexican Sangria" both were spectacular!!
27126 I have never heard of a white sangria before..
27127 But WOW it was amazing!
27128 All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere.
27129 This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list!
27130 Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!
27131 !
27132 Amazing greek food!
27133 Definitely try the greek fries!
27134 I always try to come here every time I am in Phoenix.
27135 Staff is also always very friendly!
27136 Also try the greek calamari.
27137 Unusually delicious!
27138 Awesome, Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolate/strawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had, and can't forget to mention the coffee and tea, great place
27139 The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.
27140 Babbo is much better.
27141 Food: great!
27142 Service: Excellent!
27143 I had the Frank Sinatra Calzone (you choose 3 items for the filling...I suggest what I had: sausage, pepperoni, and meatball).
27144 It was just like being back in New York.
27145 Loaded with Ricotta, too...They don't skimp here.
27146 The server was great too...Didn't catch his name, but he's a burly, bald headed guy with a beard.
27147 Very friendly, polite, attentive.
27148 Cool to look in the kitchen and see the pizzas being hand tossed...Wonder if the cook thinks I was looking at him...Well, I actually was, but only because he really got into tossing the pizzas and was entertaining to watch.
27149 Go there.
27150 Eat everything.
27151 Tip big!
27152 I was so, so hopeful.
27153 October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!
27154 Rip Off!!
27155 $10 Just to get in (what was that for?).
27156 No shade unless you were buying a drink.
27157 Most places wouldn't give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco.
27158 They seemed like the vultures who didn't care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.
27159   I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up.
27160 I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.
27161 I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would n't let me take it out!
27162 "It could have booze in it".
27163 Well, by then, I was one angry little local.
27164 Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to "go mad" with me, "Get me outta here!".
27165 She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.
27166 Nope.
27167 Not good.
27168 What happened to this place?
27169 The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.
27170 Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.
27171 Drowning in sauce.
27172 But, at least the service was decent.
27173 Just went a third time and it will be my last.
27174 Both the food and service were horrible.
27175 Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.
27176 Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.
27177 Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.
27178 In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.
27179 My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.
27180 This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.
27181 I love that this restaurant can accommodate  all types of people.
27182 It's a sports bar with Family style entertainment!
27183 The staff is always friendly and  they aim to please.
27184 The food is always good and prices are very reasonable.
27185 The bar is on one side so it splits the Families with children on the other side with an amazing area with tvs to play Xbox and wii.
27186 Check this place out.
27187 You won't be disappointed.
27188 Honestly I don't get it.
27189 I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.
27190 I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.
27191 After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.
27192 She brought us 2 beers and never came back.
27193 After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.
27194 So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.
27195 What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.
27196 If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.
27197 I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.
27198 I had an amazing dinner tonight at Quiessence.
27199 When we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything; we were, so when we sat down we were given 3 glasses of complimentary champagne.
27200 We started with a plate of three delicious cheeses.
27201 They have a huge selection of cheeses, probably about 20, and we chose a goat, a smoked gouda and a jack.
27202 All delicious and served with crostini, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth bartlett pears, pecans, honey and quince paste.
27203 Great start.
27204 Our next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad.
27205 Both good.
27206 My main course was AMAZING.
27207 It was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots.
27208 I ate every bite.
27209 SO flavorful.
27210 My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes.
27211 My mom got swordfish.
27212 It was not cooked properly when it first came out, but they promptly corrected the problem, so i can't fault them for that.
27213 The ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace.
27214 In addition, I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served.
27215 She knew where the fish was caught, how the beef was raised, what certifications the turkey farm had achieved.
27216 It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question.
27217 My only reservations would be 1) definitely is "slow" food, maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2) i'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable.
27218 They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish.
27219 My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted.
27220 I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.
27221 All in all though, a fantastic night and i can't wait to return!
27222 My wife and I absolutely love this place.
27223 Yes, it's a bit pricier... but yu get what you pay for: excellent food and service!
27224 The patio is even cigar-friendly, which is a huge plus for us!
27225 We visit often!
27226 Ok..I told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from me...I wish there were 1.5 however.
27227 As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they come..this bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk.
27228 In fact this bar would most certainly over-use that word.
27229 Does Puddle of Mudd, Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form?
27230 Do they make money from them?
27231 Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend.
27232 I had a good time...but I tend to make the best of things.
27233 There was far more facial hair than head hair.
27234 I hate phonetic spellings.. Oh lord don't ever make me go back.
27235 ...eff it...I changed my mind.
27236 1.2 stars and I am rounding down.
27237 Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us.
27238 After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal.
27239 No it normal to lift but not after 2 days!
27240 They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!!
27241 Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!
27242 Fresh bread....awesome beans!!!
27243 Raspado...tostitos!!!
27244 !
27245 best.
27246 grilled.
27247 cheese.
27248 and.
27249 tomato.
27250 soup.
27251 ever.
27252 Along with Bliss, FEZ is another one of my fav brunch spots.
27253 They have $3 specialty drinks (mimosas, bloody marys, bellinis...).
27254 The service is always quick and the servers are always attentive and very patient with my ridiculous modifications.
27255 They have a drink called a "g-spot" and it is fresh grapefruit, grapefruit juice, ruby red vodka and soda.
27256 It is unbelievable and on thursdays they are $3 (i think) The menu is different with kasras and stylish burgers but somehow we always fill up on the appetizers.
27257 The cheese fondue and the little pyllo pockets are my favs.
27258 Ive never been disappointed at FEZ and I absolutely will continue to recommend it and go back!
27259 (Thanks thomas for the corrections!)
27260 i love trader joe's!!
27261 !
27262 i think they're selection of products are just GREAT!!!
27263 i can't get enough of it.
27264 the place is clean and the people are friendly.
27265 it's right next to michaels which is also great.
27266 it's in a convenient place.
27267 it seems like the people there are nutty-crunchy which i love!
27268 !
27269 Attended the Table 12 Lunch & Learn event with guest Chef Mel Mecinas and was truly blown away.
27270 I have previously eaten off of the house menu, so was expecting just as spectacular presentation as Chef Beau Macmillan presents - I was not disappointed.
27271 Our party started the night at Jade, which I have written a review for previously.
27272 Great place, wont go into much detail there.
27273 The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna, bacon, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce.
27274 Second course was Korean short ribs, brussel spouts, and lotus root kimchi.
27275 For dessert, twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts.
27276 The meal could not have been more amazing, and the service was just as good.
27277 Have already booked the event on Aug 18.
27278 I've often driven by here, & figured I'd go in & take a look sometime.
27279 But I was looking for a clock-mini-speaker system that I use with my iPhone 4.
27280 When I had my 3G, I had a very bad experience where I was assured that a particular clock-mini-speakers I bought would work with it - but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the 3G kept falling out of - & then they gave me a hard time about a refund.
27281 This time, I was again getting either glib reassurances & non-specific information, "sorry out of stock"s, or  NO OPEN floor samples I could look at, at 3 other stores (including the big A Store with a lot of Jobs), not to mention conflicting info on Amazon & upon Googling.
27282 So I thought to go into the iStore.
27283 Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!
27284 They had open, plugged in items that I could actually test my iPhone 4 in to make sure it worked.
27285 Even better, I began chatting with the guys there about various other iPhone &  MacBook Pro issues, & found they had FAR more knowledge about BOTH the phone & it's peripherals and MacBook Pro's (and HONESTY about them) than I ever got from the "really-really-smart" folks at the Big-A-Store-with-Jobs who will promise you anything.
27286 So, I would definitely go back there for honest advice & I would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service.
27287 They also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet, they know WHAT WORKS WITH WHAT!
27288 As far as gourmet burger joints go, this place is the bomb!
27289 I am a huge fan of Deluxe Burger and now they have a run for their money!
27290 Plus the parking is much easier at Zinburger.
27291 I had the Zinburger, and we shared sweet potato fries and regular fries.
27292 Everything was delicious!
27293 All 3 of had the Zinburger, so not much variety at our table, but we all finished our burgers, and given the size of them, I was pretty surprised/impressed with all of us.
27294 The burger was heavenly, juicy and cooked perfectly.
27295 I would definitely go back, again and again!
27296 I work across the street and love me some Hava Java.
27297 The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great.
27298 I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!)
27299 they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial.
27300 I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience.
27301 This is the largest urban park.
27302 Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas.
27303 For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain.
27304 A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway.
27305 There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right.
27306 Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs.
27307 At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail.
27308 If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada.
27309 From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat man's pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail.
27310 Many unique rock formations on this hike.
27311 For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.
27312 For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider.
27313 They get five stars now.
27314 You know why?
27315 Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns!
27316 (OK, technically that's two words, but I love them nonetheless!)
27317 The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it.
27318 And, frankly, quite tasty.
27319 I don't know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!
27320 A most unexpected gem!
27321 If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights!
27322 Great selection!
27323 I can't say much more other than...
27324 AWESOME!
27325 I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it.
27326 Absolute blasphemy as I see it now.
27327 This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food.
27328 The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away.
27329 The wine glasses are filled high.
27330 Everything is great quality.
27331 Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread.
27332 This would be a great, great date night spot.
27333 I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.
27334 Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.
27335 I have to assume it's called a "Coffee Lab" for a reason.
27336 Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.
27337 If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.
27338 It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.
27339 Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.
27340 The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.
27341 These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).
27342 On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.
27343 I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.
27344 Perhaps the use of the term "Lab" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.
27345 Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.
27346 Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.
27347 It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...
27348 I digress.
27349 Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.
27350 If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.
27351 Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more.
27352 First time having Scandinavian food, everything was excellent.
27353 Will return soon.
27354 This place is great!
27355 If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor.
27356 You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere.
27357 With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating.
27358 They have a great happy hour prices!
27359 Overall great prices, great people, and a great time!
27360 If you have the right mind :)
27361 This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix.
27362 The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for.
27363 You cannot go wrong with this place!
27364 In 1999, I was discharged from the United States Marine Corps.
27365 Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like.
27366 I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand.
27367 Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair.
27368 This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides, and a leveler (no, I am not kidding) to make sure that the cut was even.
27369 I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix, Mesa, and Tempe area.
27370 This barber shop beats them all.
27371 This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix.
27372 I have been a repeat customer for 9 years, and I will keep going back until they close up shop.
27373 Tweet tweet.
27374 I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did.
27375 This company really knows how to treat their 'followers'.
27376 I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now, they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced.
27377 I have always opted for the Market pizza, a dish that includes artichokes, large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough.
27378 There hasn't been one time that I've visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order.
27379 I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their food's ingredients, atmosphere and customer service methods.
27380 As for salads,  If you can take the 'heat' I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad.
27381 The chipotle dressing, black beans, rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette.
27382 You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite.
27383 If you haven't already started your car or phoned in your order at Market, I'm 100% sure you are crazy.
27384 #BRAVO  (hashtagging seems appropriate here).
27385 These little sliders are tasty, delicious and pretty speedy.
27386 You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions.
27387 There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers!
27388 Fries are 5 star as well...also enjoy the people watching...Scottsdale at its finest!
27389 One word to describe this hotel: quality.
27390 The pools were all warm and unique.
27391 The hotel has two hot tubs, one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream, the other is on its own "island".
27392 There are two pools, a lazy river, and a small pool.
27393 The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean.
27394 One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice.
27395 All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation.
27396 The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services.
27397 I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi.
27398 The Marriott burger, creme  brûlée, drinks, and fromage board was very good.
27399 As good as all the others, and closer to home than most.
27400 The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table.
27401 Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks.
27402 Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying "have you guys decided yet on what you want?
27403 ", uhh yeah!
27404 Overall, service was poor and food was just okay.
27405 Won't be going back.
27406 Good place to chill with a drink somewhere lowly lit and good live music.
27407 All the bartenders are really nice and that's always RAD:)
27408 Panda Garden is a family run Chinese Food Restaurant that is always friendly, and most importantly, delicious.
27409 You can order dishes family style and there's plenty of delicious meals to try.
27410 My personal favorite is the Empress Chicken, sweeter then Orange Chicken, but the flavor just melts in your mouth.
27411 I just had the Kung Pao Two which is Chicken and Shrimp, and its even better the next day as leftovers thanks to the generous portions.
27412 They have a good selection of sake and beer as well.
27413 This is my favorite Chinese restaurant and hope everyone else checks it out.
27414 Closed on Sunday?
27415 Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too.
27416 Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay.
27417 *CASH AND CHECKS ONLY*
27418 *OPEN 9 AM, 7 DAYS A WEEK*
27419 Love this place.
27420 Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut.
27421 We had Miss Tara, who provided us with a "first haircut" certificate and she also had these tiny quarter-size ziploc bags for my daughter's very first strand of hair that she cut.
27422 The haircut was $15.
27423 Along with the haircut, Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair.
27424 My daughter LOVED it.
27425 The place itself was kid-friendly.
27426 There's a little kitchen for the kids to play with while waiting for their haircut.
27427 There are 3 big kid chairs for older kids to get their haircut.
27428 And there are 2 car-styled chairs for the younger kids.
27429 I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today.
27430 We had Miss Annette.
27431 She was great.
27432 Again, my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair.
27433 The haircut was $15.
27434 We also got a punchcard, where you're 9th haircut will be free.
27435 This place does walk-ins, but it is better to call and schedule an appointment since they don't have a specific opening/closing time.
27436 They take CASH ONLY so keep that in mind.
27437 Amazing bagels and a great staff.
27438 I always get the build your bagel sandwich it's heaven!
27439 This was such a good experience
27440 I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache
27441 I don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentist
27442 Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T.
27443 Still
27444 I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm
27445 It was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m.
27446 it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity
27447 so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted
27448 i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears
27449 It didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job
27450 they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up
27451 the follow up appointment is FREE!
27452 totally recommend this place to any and everyone!
27453 Is there a way I can give LUSH an extra star??
27454 ?
27455 Pros: Friendly & enthusiastic staff, incredible products, lots of samples, phenomenal smells, reasonable prices, and get this, an HONEST company!!!
27456 Read their bag, it'll make you love them more.
27457 Cons: if you're sensitive to smells, brace yourself.
27458 Also, if you're the type that wants to be left alone while you shop, beware.
27459 The staff is excited about their products.
27460 Don't miss: R&B hair moisturizer (it drives men crazy!
27461 ), Coalface facial cleanser & Brazen Honey exfoliating mask.
27462 this place is so darn cute!
27463 You might miss it if you are driving too fast.
27464 The food is like nothing I have ever experienced.
27465 I had the pot pie, mmmm was that tasty.
27466 All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping.
27467 I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one.
27468 The only thing that was slightly off, was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small.
27469 With that said, the portions being small left us room for dessert.
27470 The dessert was out of this world!
27471 You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu!
27472 I will be back for lunch for sure, and will bring visitors to this location too!
27473 2nd time messing up our carry out order.
27474 Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!
27475 Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion.
27476 Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce.
27477 Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again.
27478 Will not be back.
27479 I absolutely love the food here!
27480 The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.
27481 This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable.
27482 Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open.
27483 You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!
27484 Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love.
27485 A lot more than just tofu!
27486 I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time.
27487 A few of our favorite items are the BBQ "Chicken" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis.
27488 Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles).
27489 The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty.
27490 The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though.
27491 Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese.
27492 Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.
27493 The atmosphere is very artsy.
27494 There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side.
27495 They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy.
27496 There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.
27497 Another great thing about Green is the vegan market.
27498 They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with.
27499 It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls.
27500 As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.
27501 Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving.
27502 They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized.
27503 "Turkey", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink.
27504 You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts.
27505 Highly recommend.
27506 Burger was delicious and fresh.
27507 Fries were well seasoned and crispy.
27508 Huge selection of bottled sodas from across the nation.
27509 Fun and good!
27510 Definitely coming back.
27511 Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family!
27512 Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door!
27513 Fast service and great food too!
27514 HUGE portions!!
27515 I recommend splitting entree's.
27516 We ordered 2 entree's between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home!
27517 I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy.
27518 Hubby had the Gyro's and loved them!
27519 (Gyro's were probably enough food for 3 people!!
27520 ).
27521 Moderate prices.
27522 Averaging about $15 bucks a plate, but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants, almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon?
27523 I was told they had the best cannoli's in town.....so I had to save room for one!
27524 !...and they were pretty darn good!
27525 !
27526 To sum it up...... FAST~FRIENDLY~FRESH FOOD!!
27527 !
27528 Yummy!
27529 !
27530 I just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon.
27531 I got a Green Apple Snow and he got a Mocha...
27532 Blast?
27533 or something like that.
27534 We both loved them.
27535 While the drink was amazing, what was even better was the quality of their boba, they weren't too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste.
27536 The shop was really clean and nice and cool.
27537 I also noticed they had battleship and I think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with.
27538 They also had a computer monitor I am guessing for games.
27539 I didn't go to look at it.
27540 I think there was music on but I can't remember.
27541 The service was really fast, but then we were the only ones there.
27542 You can't use a debit/credit card for an order under $10 so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit.
27543 We asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it.
27544 I can't say one bad thing about it.
27545 If I find something else on another visit I will update.
27546 As of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba.
27547 Recently moved from the East Coast.
27548 So glad Yelp introduced us to Il Bosco.
27549 I highly recommend the Biaggia pizza.
27550 It's amazing.
27551 Great food and great hospitality from this small little spot.
27552 If you are looking for a place where the service matches the food, look no further.
27553 This family style Americanized-Italian restaurant was beyond comparison.
27554 The staff is very friendly and if you have children, they will well entertained while stuffing their faces with amazing food.
27555 From the freshly baked bread to the main coarse, every bite was like a new adventure for my taste buds.
27556 They have a wide variety of food but I highly recommend the pasta dishes.
27557 Your mouth will thank you the moment you take your first bite.
27558 So, after finding out I didn't have to be a juror today, I decided to go to Treehouse to celebrate!
27559 I got 12 different cupcakes (intending to share with my husband and friends at work of course!)
27560 and wasn't disappointed.
27561 I love the caramel chocolate and peanut butter chocolate ones best!
27562 The only ingredient I hope Treehouse considers adding is avocado, since it makes vegan cupcakes decadently rich!
27563 One of the sister's who co-owns and is a co-baker was a doll.
27564 We both are hoping Phoenix continues to build up a variety of veggie- conscientious, healthy/delicious places to frequent.
27565 I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude.
27566 She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else.
27567 When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, "Well, go somewhere else."
27568 I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now.
27569 Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers.
27570 I've eatin' a lot of pizza and can say without worries that Mama Mia's is the Best I've had -- Consistency, value and great service sets them apart -- They also have the best take out wings in town!!!
27571 !
27572 Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.
27573 I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.
27574 At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.
27575 Matt's was on our mind.
27576 We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.
27577 Busy place, but the service was great.
27578 Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.
27579 Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.
27580 We both had the home fries.
27581 When everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.
27582 Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.
27583 My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.
27584 Calories be damned!
27585 The whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.
27586 Yes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time.
27587 The message I received was drip is toast.
27588 I don't drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.)
27589 I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation.
27590 This is a lovely little place, a gem.
27591 I enjoy every visit.
27592 It is especially nice to bring new people in that haven't been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.)
27593 The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything I've tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast.
27594 Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly.
27595 I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.
27596 I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.
27597 Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.
27598 Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.
27599 It's a little hole in the wall type place.
27600 The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.
27601 The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.
27602 It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.
27603 It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.
27604 The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.
27605 The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.
27606 The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.
27607 I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.
27608 He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him.
27609 With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.
27610 Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.
27611 Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.
27612 Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take "any seat I wanted" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.
27613 With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.
27614 Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive "Grandma Slice" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.
27615 Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was "wow - that is a lot of cheese" while my second, after a bite, was "wow - that is a lot of flavor."
27616 Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.
27617 Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.
27618 Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.
27619 With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.
27620 I loved this place!
27621 A bit pricey, but excellent quality.
27622 Been here twice and haven't had anything we didn't like.
27623 The meat is great quality and they'll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that won't cook something below medium well.
27624 Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes.
27625 Although everything is so big and filling I certainly can't have all that in one trip!
27626 Definitely a decadent tasty treat.
27627 Ok, im not getting the great reviews on this place.
27628 I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts.
27629 I have a few problems here.
27630 The big one, can we please list that "only the donuts with holes" are $5.49 for 6?
27631 Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7.
27632 Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else.
27633    Second, these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best.
27634 The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet.
27635 And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale.
27636 This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's.
27637 Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter.
27638 Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business.
27639 I am disabled with MS.
27640 The heat of summer about does me in, esp.
27641 in the car.
27642 Because of this, and because the best thing I've ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA.
27643 All day.
27644 Loads of it.
27645 Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it.
27646 I learned of the Tea District through somebody's ad and like them very much as well.
27647 But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix.
27648 And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers.
27649 And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees.
27650 It should be here any day, and I can't wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavana's Opus Rouge.
27651 I love red heavily tart, fruity teas.
27652 It doesn't matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it.
27653 In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit.
27654 I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong.
27655 I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want.
27656 With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart).
27657 I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again.
27658 Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.
27659 Sincerely,

27664 Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you, while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini?
27665 If your answer is yes, don't bother coming here.
27666 Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix, but the Bikini is in my 'hood.
27667 It's a dirty, unassuming place, with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox.
27668 There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini:
27669 1.
27670 Bring cash.
27671 Cards aren't accepted, the atm machine is there for decoration only, as it hasn't worked in at least two years.
27672 2.
27673 Don't make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat.
27674 He's my neighbor.
27675 3.
27676 Don't piss off the bartenders.
27677 Tip them well, treat them nicely, and don't order more than three dirty martinis.
27678 If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you.
27679 This includes, but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks, the price of your drinks, and whether or not you get a drink at all.
27680 They take no shit.
27681 If you can't handle it, stay away.
27682 The place gets crowded enough as it is.
27683 I have nothing more to add, but I don't want anyone to think 'only a few' people had  complaints about this poorly planned "festival."
27684 Oh, wait, I do.
27685 I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks.
27686 I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3.
27687 But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers.
27688 And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage.
27689 By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101.
27690 Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance.
27691 If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success.
27692 If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much.
27693 And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders?
27694 Why risk your hard-fought reputation?
27695 I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner.
27696 I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter.
27697 I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me.
27698 The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly!
27699 They're amazing and you'll get tons of them.
27700 The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in.
27701 If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl.
27702 It's got the same feel, but more modern.
27703 Love love love it.
27704 It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better.
27705 I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado.
27706 Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.
27707 The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it.
27708 As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible.
27709 I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least.
27710 Now for the tacos.
27711 Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo.
27712 The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra.
27713 Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight.
27714 This place simply doesn't care.
27715 On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.
27716 Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town.
27717 I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves.
27718 No more.
27719 There is something for everyone on the menu.
27720 It's more than pizza.
27721 The service is great.
27722 Get a table on the terrace and you get the view of the park and fountain.
27723 I will keep going back.
27724 I cannot say enough good things about this place!
27725 The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best I've ever experienced.
27726 Every time my boyfriend and I dine here the owner visits with us and asks how we are, etc.
27727 I've only had Pho at a couple of places in town so I can't speak to the authenticity but it tastes amazing and fresh every time.
27728 Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do (and family owned is always a plus for me!)
27729 are just priceless.
27730 UnPhogettable is always worth the drive to Mesa.
27731 Delicious salad, pizza, and wine.
27732 We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!!
27733 The crust is perfect!
27734 The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12.
27735 Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount.
27736 Sold... !
27737 We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99.
27738 I go to Pro's Ranch Market often for lunch- sometimes several times a week.
27739 I've had the street tacos, chile relleno, burritos, and some other tasty treats.
27740 I'm a huge fan of the agua fresca stand- my favorites are the strawberry, pineapple, and horchata.
27741 And the bakery... oh, the bakery.
27742 They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake.
27743 The store itself has the cheapest produce in town, a giant meat counter, and a great assortment of cheeses.
27744 Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas.
27745 This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm on my way to a BBQ or party- there are so many options!
27746 Love this place!
27747 A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink!
27748 Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations.
27749 On my last visit, I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips.
27750 Zero disappointment.
27751 I have only eaten here once, but i cannot wait to go back!
27752 the service was phenomenal, the potstickers huge and delicious!
27753 the orange beef - just as good as a pf changs!
27754 I had a restaurant.com coupon, purchased $10 gift card for .80 cents!
27755 Highly recommend!
27756 I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.
27757 However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.
27758 Here's Why ...
27759 They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.
27760 It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.
27761 Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.
27762 We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.
27763 Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.
27764 On this Satuday night people were having a good time.
27765 The draft beer was perfect and fresh.
27766 The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.
27767 We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.
27768 This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !
27769 It's just a terrific steakhouse.
27770 One of the most upscale, all around dining experiences in Phoenix.
27771 It's expensive.
27772 Very expensive.
27773 But probably worth it.
27774 Figure $150-200 for a couple.
27775 I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze.
27776 Absolutely outstanding, amazingly tasty meats.
27777 Equal or better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris or Capitol Grill (that's on the menu for tomorrow night).
27778 Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about.
27779 Veggies were pretty good.
27780 Started with the ceasar salary, with a big pile of anchovies.
27781 Perhaps the best Caesar I've ever had.
27782 Desert was the mouse cake.
27783 Good, but not to die for.
27784 Their happy hour is also an excellent value.
27785 Come before six and drinks are half off, and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches, which are very good.
27786 Hint:  If you have kids, go to happy hour and have a drink or two.
27787 Cocktails are in the $7 range happy hour price.
27788 Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail.
27789 Let the kids eat the sandwiches, and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets.
27790 The kids are pretty full, you are nicely primed for a great steak, and the complete lack of a kids menu doesn't matter.
27791 Honestly, otherwise, there really aren't any good kids options.
27792 I know, it's not a great place for kids, even well behaved, but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family.
27793 It would be nice if they offered a mini-filet for 12 and under for like $15, or a burger and fries for $10 for the kids.
27794 Just a thought.
27795 Anyway, great experience, great food.
27796 A really upscale, while linen, old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef.
27797 Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!
27798 Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance
27799 Great food and very friendly service.
27800 Happy to recommend!
27801 Yes, please!
27802 This place is AMAZING!
27803 I brought my family here after coming many times, and everyone LOVES IT!
27804 The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER!
27805 I HIGHLY recommend.
27806 I really don't know if there is anything to avoid at this place.
27807 Just love it every time!
27808 We have tried many dishes, and they are always flavorful and fabulous.
27809 There's a reason there's a banner that reads,' Food Network Challenge Winner', hanging in their farmer market booth.
27810 I've had Pastry Chef Chris's gingerbread cookies; biscotti; coconut/chocolate cookies; and their carrot cake, and they have all been really, really, reaaaaally good!
27811 But today, at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market, I was knocked out by what she calls "Lemon Sunshine."
27812 Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream & graham crust tart/pie is.
27813 Lemon tarts/pies are among my all time favorite desserts.
27814 I thought that the ones I had from TK's bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tart/pie could be.
27815 Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfect...
27816 A must try!!!!
27817 !
27818 This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee.
27819 The food is excellent.
27820 The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly.
27821 This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service.
27822 It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food.
27823 Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame.
27824 You will not be disappointed.
27825 The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.
27826 Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community.
27827 They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate.
27828 I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood.
27829 I was impressed with this place.
27830 I had the Mongolian Lamb and an Asahi beer.
27831 It totaled $14.00 before tip which I thought was reasonable for dinner and especially for a lamb dish.
27832 The portions were very generous and even though I was starving when I stopped in, I ended up only eating about half of the meal before getting full.
27833 It was delicious.
27834 Tender lamb and a great sauce.
27835 The waiter was very polite and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly.
27836 It was very comfortable inside and the decor was tasteful.
27837 I did not expect that one of the best Chinese restaurants (of course in my opinion) would be located in Avondale.
27838 I feel bad for frequenting the Pei Wei on Dysart and McDowell so often when a non-chain place of this caliber is right up the road.
27839 There're times when you eat something and you want more.
27840 Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it.
27841 For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco.
27842 My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about.
27843 We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it.
27844 We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy.
27845 I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things.
27846 BEST DECISION OF THE DAY.
27847 The Biancoverde was my favorite.
27848 It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing.
27849 It has left me wanting more to this day.
27850 The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties.
27851 I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again.
27852 In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!
27853 i know, i know.
27854 this gelato is a bit on the pricier side, especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops, that  each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons.
27855 HOWEVER, arlecchino is definitely the BEST.
27856 it's worth theprice, worth the drive, and worth the parking hassle.
27857 the owners are super nice and accommodating, and although there is a sample limit, the workers have never said no more.
27858 the flavors are classic, inventive, fresh, and authentic.
27859 plus, it's such a cute, tiny little hole-in-the-wall shoppe, that you can't help but love it in all it's quaint glory.
27860 I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.
27861 "Big deal," I thought.
27862 "How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?"
27863 Well, the food was amazing.
27864 And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.
27865 A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.
27866 My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus.
27867 Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.
27868 When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered.
27869 I had the short ribs plate.
27870 The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.
27871 After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.
27872 The guy preparing food replied with a laugh.
27873 "Is it good?"
27874 I asked
27875 Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, "Yes it's good."
27876 Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).
27877 About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.
27878 The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!
27879 The prices are very reasonable.
27880 Plates are about $10 and less.
27881 I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.
27882 And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions.
27883 Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).
27884 Additional Notes:
27885 - Cash Only.
27886 - Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).
27887 - There never seems to be any "Lumpia!"
27888 :-/
27889 They added broasted chicken to their menu...
27890 I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.
27891 I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.
27892 To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it.
27893 I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.
27894 I can't speak to anything else on the menu.
27895 Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine.
27896 I really don't like these types of Mexican food places because I feel my mom makes better Mexican food.
27897 Just a note: Not all Filibertos are the same.
27898 Food taste wise.....
27899 This Filibertos is BOMB though!
27900 They make great Spanish rice, and beans!
27901 All the food is great!
27902 But I recommend the rolled tacos if it's going to be your first time here.
27903 I think it's combo #8 haha.
27904 They also have some old school arcade games.
27905 That's a plus for me haha.
27906 Please stop going to Macayos they have the worst fake tasting Mexican food.
27907 Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle.
27908 This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked.
27909 We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed.
27910 Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice.
27911 The interior and atmosphere are great.
27912 Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.
27913 An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves.
27914 That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment.
27915 They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed.
27916 They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic.
27917 It has a few other elements to it including Lavender.
27918 They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.
27919 For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli.
27920 The hummus was very creamy but a little plain.
27921 We wished there was more flavor or spice to it.
27922 Not a big deal.
27923 That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars.
27924 The tabooli....ridiculous.
27925 I've never been a fan of tabooli.
27926 It usually has too much parsley.
27927 But their version was balanced perfectly.
27928 For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron.
27929 A huge plate of rice with great seasoning.
27930 The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture.
27931 The Shawarma was fresh and delicious.
27932 The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.
27933 For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava.
27934 The ice cream was some of the best we've had.
27935 Great flavor.
27936 The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream.
27937 A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.
27938 So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable.
27939 Everything we had came to about $32.
27940 We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising.
27941 Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is.
27942 The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.
27943 Elmer, I love you.
27944 I have since I was a senior at Chandler High.
27945 Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good.
27946 If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.
27947 Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro.
27948 And it is always so good.
27949 Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.
27950 And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids.
27951 I love you Elmer.
27952 I always will.
27953 this is a business located in the fry's grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but don't bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked.
27954 I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner.
27955 it's always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible w/owner in house.
27956 Did I ever write about the time I left my ipad here?
27957 Didn't realize for a couple of hours.
27958 Heart racing, I called, emailed, hoped it would be recovered.
27959 What gracious responses!
27960 I got an email early next morning, lots of reassurances, help for when/ how to pick up... Ok so I've reviewed this place before, key words are wonderful creative dishes, a light touch for subtle flavor (right now I'm having a delectable plate of greens, shaved herbs, summer squash wrapped around burrata--- who woulda thought?)
27961 but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here.
27962 Oh.. And there's mightly fine wine on "tap".
27963 Heh heh..
27964 The food is EXCELLENT!
27965 We have been 5 times now, and everything we have had has been delicious!
27966 We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco!
27967 The Caprese is AWESOME!
27968 This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix.
27969 I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time.
27970 =)
27971 The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.
27972 The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store.
27973 It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed.
27974 I highly recommend.
27975 They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment.
27976 I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.
27977 They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball.
27978 You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish.
27979 these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive.
27980 You have to try these during your visit.
27981 The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream.
27982 It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream.
27983 It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.
27984 If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about.
27985 Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!
27986 Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.
27987 FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal.
27988 I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.
27989 5 stars isnt enough!!!
27990 I love the whole Briggs family.
27991 I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me.
27992 I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home.
27993 They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting.
27994 They use the most high tech things I have ever seen, and its good to know I'm getting A+ care for my pearly whites.
27995 I recommend them to everyone I know!
27996 Can not say enough good about this place.
27997 I love it.
27998 I love it!
27999 I simply love it!
28000 We have always had really great service and the food!
28001 Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.
28002 They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!
28003 Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!
28004 I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!
28005 Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!
28006 I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.
28007 My daughter swears by it!
28008 Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew....
28009 This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back.
28010 The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me, she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it.
28011 The red light therapy is a nice idea...
28012 But the room the bed was in was lacking.
28013 They should hire an exterminator, not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet...
28014 Yuck!
28015 !
28016 Best Vietnamese food I've had, and I've been to some very good Vietnamese places.
28017 Very fresh and delicious.
28018 I Felt a sin coming on .......
28019  if i could give 10 stars i would !!!
28020 !
28021 Let me set the scene for you of this Kazilicious Sunday night .....
28022 We enter through  a solid planked door set in the rear ...(oh yes the
28023 truth is inside) candlelit passageway leads you into a sexy,sultry
28024 stone interior that is softened by the plush seating , dim lighting
28025 ,wine barrels .. i give his hand a squeeze and smile because we have
28026 hit the mother load within this sinfully sexy speakeasy .The Tuscan
28027 colors coupled with the stone ..deep ,rich ,decadent !!!
28028 His hand on
28029 the small of my back as we approach our seats as the intimacy and
28030 ambiance takes hold .
28031 A bowl of olives, 3 cheese fondue with apple ,the Tuscany pizza
28032 ....sexy damn noshes ..they know what they are doing here ..soft
28033 ...firm....dip....bite ..yesssss SO beyond sexy here.....
28034 Oh and the wine ,nectar of the gods, sign of fertility , here in this
28035 setting it is like Ambrosia ,and your inner God or Goddess will surely
28036 blossom ,and romance will bloom ....
28037 It seems like thousands of labels here - we went with the  M.
28038 Chapoutier Le Sizeranne 98' ....Heady ,earthy ,smoky ,deep ,sweet and
28039 ripe .the smell of currants and berries .lovely texture ,full bodied
28040 .....DIVINE !
28041 let the flirting begin ..coy toying of the glass stem
28042 ..sweet smiles ..love words escaping on a whisper  between sips.
28043 We spent around $200 ,worth every penny in my opinion .
28044 Prior to the Kaz , the Rokerij was just about the sexiest spot to me
28045 in the valley ...these two must share the crown .
28046 So to recap ; SEXY, SULTRY,SEDUCTIVE !!!!!
28047 posh,swank ...
28048 Good Service , lush wine selection ,yummy tidbits ...
28049 Ambiance up the wazoooo .
28050 A heady experience ..this is where lovers go ,a prelude to the
28051 interlude of love !
28052 Went today for the first time.
28053 The quesadillas were the best I've ever had.
28054 My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious!
28055 The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas.
28056 And not to forget the staff.
28057 We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!
28058 I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer.
28059 This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!
28060 I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.
28061 The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!
28062 Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.
28063 Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.
28064 Waiters and manager the best.
28065 Fun little place to just explore and TRY so many different samplings.
28066 The staff was great and super friendly!
28067 The lemon cupcakes were AMAZING!!
28068 !
28069 Little tip:  buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades
28070 Melrose Pharmacy is my go-to pharmacy.
28071 Not only is it in my neighborhood, it is independently owned and operated by Teresa Stickler.
28072 Her and her husband Kurt are people who care about the community.
28073 The fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake.
28074 They are also lightening quick, dispensing most prescriptions while you wait.
28075 Moreover, they are a FULL  service pharmacy, they also offer delivery (handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death) and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on non-prescription drugs and vitamins (often recommending the lower priced generic brand).
28076 In addition, you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products, as well as a selection of snacks, books and small gifts.
28077 Even if you don't need to get a prescription filled, it's worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy.
28078 Better yet, stop by on a First Friday when the pharmacy features live music, and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex.
28079 Loved this place!!!!
28080 Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!
28081 !
28082 Wow.
28083 If you're into owner-driven, husband-and-wife run, casual and unpretentious yet upper-class/comfortable "fine" environs, food, service, wine, and music (acoustic live music 3x/wk (with no cover!
28084 )), the kind of place where everyone talks to/welcomes everyone yet no one is nosy or cliquish, where the whole place cheerfully claps when Mrs Owner breaks a glass (and someone calls out "it's earlier than that normally happens,"),  free wi-fi, where you have a nice patio with heaters and a front-row Fountain view, wine by the bottle from their extensive retail collection or yours -- with just a $5 corkage (as well as a decent (7-9 reds and 7-9 whites selection by the glass for $7-$10), a great craft beer selection (Union Jack IPA!
28085 ), couches, nice hightops, an l-shaped bar, great local artwork (also for sale), this will be your new favorite place.
28086 If you like stuffy, over-priced, boring, see-to-be-seen places with angry (or no) music, this place isn't for you.
28087 Second time here and Mr Owner greets me by name.
28088 Are you kidding?!
28089 Does that happen anymore?
28090 And when I say to him "that's cool," someone else in the bar comments about how I must be new because that's just how they do it here.
28091 You can order anything off the menu from next door (Euro Pizza Cafe) for no up-charge.
28092 Amazing.
28093 Get the "Dr Oz Sautéed Veggies.".
28094 Trust me.
28095 This place has a great vibe and one part of me hopes these positive reviews don't result in oppressive crowds, but on the other hand, something tells me they'd handle it with a smile and 5 star service.
28096 Get here.
28097 Just get here.
28098 This is a great Thai food restaurant.
28099 My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service.
28100 We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai.
28101 The food is always consistently good.
28102 Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find, you definitely won't be disappointed here.
28103 I came here for the first time ever on Mother's Day.
28104 They were packed ,the line was out the door and down the path.
28105 Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to.
28106 We were a party of 10  our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name.
28107 She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously.
28108 Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed, as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot.
28109 The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices.
28110 I loved the food.
28111 I had shrimp and fish and vegetables.
28112 Nothing fried.
28113 The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu!!
28114 Although there were many different choices.
28115 You could never say that you did not like what they were serving.
28116 have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go.
28117 I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.
28118 I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy.
28119 The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to.
28120 However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.
28121 I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE.
28122 The flavor was very bland and half cold.
28123 The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.
28124 I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made.
28125 Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon.
28126 The best !
28127 From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin' this place.
28128 I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimi's ,Gauc ,rice and beans)
28129 The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum !
28130 ... AND reasonably priced.
28131 We showed up out of the blue on Valentine's night looking for food.
28132 We got a seat at the sushi bar right away, but the place was otherwise packed.
28133 I guess we were lucky.
28134 We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate.
28135 Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start.
28136 Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves.
28137 Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment.
28138 In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting.
28139 We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make.
28140 So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu.
28141 We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego.
28142 (The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)
28143 I didn't know what to expect from this store.
28144 It was over 105° so I wanted something cold!
28145 You get samples to help you or confuse you in to many choices!
28146 I went with the basic: cookies& cream mixed with vanilla carmel.
28147 Do yourself a favor & get the large so you can mix plus go on Thursday for double stamp day!
28148 Absolutely unbelievable!!!
28149 This is so worth the drive from Scottsdale to Tempe!
28150 But get there early as they close early and run out of food!
28151 It's so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it.
28152 I love French pastries, crepes and desserts!
28153 The macaroons melt in your mouth.
28154 I will be returning soon!
28155 Best Ice cream sandwhich I have ever had
28156 Took Maddie here for a quick nail trim, was super impressed.
28157 Friendly staff, prompt service, and light on the wallet.
28158 What more could you want.
28159 My dog is with me always, so I wont need the boarding services, but will definitely make this my new pet vet!
28160 My co-workers have gone to the vaccination clinic they have where they were also impressed by the service and low price!
28161 Thumbs up for this place!
28162 Wow, this place is still here?
28163 I went there as a girl (15+ years ago) with the family on a regular basis.
28164 If it's still around, then it MUST be good!
28165 This is my favorite venue--we've held two events here, and I've attended another four.
28166 As an attendee, it's clean, bright, FREE parking, good food, constantly refreshed coffee and beverages, and good layout.
28167 I love it.
28168 As a planner, it's a good deal for what you get, and it's a well managed event end to end.
28169 Conference staff are easy to work with, flexible, and they are there to support you.
28170 IT works and it works well.
28171 it's a great facility, food, service, and staff.
28172 Good open expo area too, if you have vendors, advice--do not use a separate room if you have a lot of vendors--put them in the main ballroom, and/or the vestibule, not in any other room.
28173 Vendors like to be showcased and have traffic, not shuttled off to a low traffic low visibility area --regardless of any price savings.
28174 Rarely give a 5, but truthfully?
28175 We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here...thought we were there...I'm sure Giu.
28176 is good, but Arrivederci is the bomb.
28177 We will keep going on every visit.
28178 Reasonable and really, really authentic.
28179 Bueno Sera is your welcome..and they mean it!
28180 We loved it.
28181 .
28182 .
28183 reasonable, too.
28184 b
28185 The pool area was very nice.
28186 Every chair had a towel on it ready for you.
28187 The pool service was great.
28188 Greg Badger is the most hard-working waiter there.
28189 He was out in the sun in upper 90/lower 100 degree temperatures and was very helpful to all the guests.
28190 I ate at Elements the other times I visited Arizona, but the poolside menu is great too!
28191 I preferred the orange chicken bento box.
28192 Although edamame was not on the poolside menu, our waiter was able to get it for us.
28193 That is great service!
28194 The bed was very comfortable; nice and soft.
28195 I also liked the wall-mounted, flatscreen LCD tv.The valet service was great as well.
28196 We were greeted everytime we drove into the Sanctuary complex.
28197 The tennis courts were very nice as well.
28198 I played during the morning and made use of their ball machine to warm up.
28199 We recently moved nearby Pho Ao Sen and dine there often.
28200 I love their food, the service, and also the atmosphere.
28201 My favorite's are the bun dishes, I always order the no.
28202 26 with chicken instead of pork and they have a delicious vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli that I would highly recommend.
28203 Pho Ao Sen is a great place to dine with friends, mine have always enjoyed the experience.
28204 Read al lthe hype, so decided to give Cyclo a try.
28205 What a disappointment!
28206 Portions were small and overpriced, owner thinks she's the next best thing to sliced bread.
28207 She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared.
28208 Give this place a miss.
28209 I was in Phoenix for three weeks on a business trip and luckily found this spot on my 3rd day in town.
28210 I ended up eating here 7 times in 21 days.
28211 I brought my coworkers here, and they all ended up eating here at least 2-3 times.
28212 It's just that good.
28213 So how good is it?
28214 Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale!
28215 I've eaten the fish tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos, and tortilla soup.
28216 All were exceptional!
28217 They also bring out chips with salsa, as well as beans, which was a nice touch.
28218 The dining area is fairly small, but they do have an outside dining area as well.
28219 The wait staff is very friendly, and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down, which is something that more restaurants should do!
28220 The food comes out very quickly, and they do have 2 TVs, one on either side of the dining room, which are usually tuned to a sporting event.
28221 I've been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo!
28222 I'll definitely be going back the next time that I'm in Phoenix!
28223 Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday.
28224 The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet.
28225 We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room.
28226 Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they "usually" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.
28227 They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty.
28228 It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!
28229 Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though.
28230 Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy!
28231 The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!!
28232 I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me.
28233 =(  Everyone loved their meal!
28234 !
28235 My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her!
28236 Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!
28237 !
28238 We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around.
28239 While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a "Steakhouse kinda girl" it was all good stuff.
28240 They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?!
28241 It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's.
28242 P.S.
28243 I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin.
28244 (O_o)
28245 I love this place!
28246 My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly.
28247 We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great.
28248 The happy hour menu was amazing too.
28249 $5 Mark West Pinot Noir!
28250 The manager was super friendly and came over to make sure we were doing okay.
28251 Great experience!
28252 Definitely recommend the calamari too!
28253 I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here.
28254 It's THAT good.
28255 I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?
28256 Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's.
28257 I, personally, find it to be awesome.
28258 Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare.
28259 And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards.
28260 Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.
28261 I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY!
28262 They have the best meatball sub....compared to Jimmy' Johns it is GOLDEN (never mind the fact that JJ's doesn't have hot subs...) They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great.
28263 My go to sandwich shop  **MUCH LOVE TO SM!
28264 *
28265 Put it in the baby book.
28266 Baby's first AJ's.
28267 And you'll always have a special soft place in your heart for your first.
28268 I love that while this location is in a nice part of town, it's not quite the same level of frou-frou as many other spots.
28269 That means rather than dealing with the Scottsdale types who have to dress up to go to the store - you're dealing with a greater range of folks - but they are all willing to pay a bit more for the good stuff.
28270 I will say, you'll pay less for a box of cereal or box of triscuits at a Circle K than you will at an AJ's.
28271 And I don't think I've ever seen anything on sale.
28272 But there is just nothing like their fresh food.
28273 Be it produce or the meat section, the colors are brighter, the items are bigger and you just know it's going to taste better.
28274 Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good, and so large, you want to eat them all at once, but you just can't.
28275 You have to try some of their pre-prepped meats.
28276 My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing.
28277 Wow.
28278 And of course, great pre-made foods too if you just want to pick up something to go.
28279 I've been suckered in to their desert section far too many times.
28280 And they are always good.
28281 But dang they can be pricy - so it really has to just be a special splurge.
28282 If you haven't tried an AJ's yet, I suggest this one to ease you into things.
28283 There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot, but there won't be too many Hummers.
28284 Thanks to everyone who put up with all the closed roads and driving detours yesterday for the marathon.
28285 As one of the largest marathons in the country it was really cool to see all the spectators, volunteers and bands supporting and encouraging the 34,000 runners.
28286 I finished the half marathon yesterday and the war wounds aren't nearly as bad, but I am sore as hell still.
28287 It became clear at the startline  that we really have to do something about the Capitol complex.
28288 That area is a disaster.
28289 Thanks for all the carb-heavy food and drink at the start and finish.
28290 I have never enjoyed spilling hot coffee all over myself up until yesterday morning.
28291 Thanks to the UPS drivers who hauled our stuff to the finish.
28292 The half-marathon doesn't run through the most attractive parts of Phoenix, but McDowell Road is definitely a step up from Van Buren..  That's for sure.
28293 Could you imagine thousands of runners trying to dodge hookers on their way to the finish line?
28294 And also, thanks to the guys in my running corral who dressed up and ran as the Super Mario Bros: Mario and Luigi.
28295 You guys rock.
28296 I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me.
28297 I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home.
28298 Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time.
28299 I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there).
28300 So, there's no negative stars, too bad.
28301 Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.
28302 The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price.
28303 $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings.
28304 Where'd they get their chef, Chili's?
28305 What a disappointment.
28306 All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?
28307 I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well.
28308 Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'.
28309 Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good!
28310 Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling.
28311 The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door.
28312 I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews.
28313 I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday.
28314 Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.
28315 Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth:
28316 1.
28317 They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl.
28318 I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!
28319 2.
28320 Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.
28321 I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal.
28322 3.
28323 They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries.
28324 I hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.
28325 I obviously won't be back.
28326 =(
28327 If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go!
28328 You'll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price.
28329 Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store.
28330 I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop.
28331 From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people I've met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase.
28332 Stop by!!
28333 You'll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- you'll be happy!!
28334 "Get more for less!"
28335 Hip hop sandwich shop.
28336 Not a traditional dining experience.
28337 Food was great, and prices were very great.
28338 Everything on menu was under $10.
28339 Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer, and the BLT was rediculously delicious.
28340 I look forward to going back again, and probably again.
28341 Had the best BEST time here tonight!
28342 My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me.
28343 I've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in.
28344 The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice.
28345 The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar).
28346 We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great!
28347 We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically weren't all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!)
28348 and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour).
28349 The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app).
28350 The service was also extremely good.
28351 It's been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!
28352 Love it here!
28353 Always unique and slightly dark art.
28354 Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~
28355 I never knew this movie theater existed.
28356 I mean I don't frequent paradise valley mall that often, and when I go, I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there.
28357 So when Travelzoo had their movie special ( two tickets, 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for $15), I couldn't pass it up.
28358 The theater is small but very quaint.
28359 The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline.
28360 How cool is that.
28361 Plus the best part?
28362 the staff are super duper friendly.
28363 A huge win in my book.
28364 I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater.
28365 UMMMMMMMM...can I just say that this place needs to get more action!
28366 The pizzas here are FANTASTIC!!
28367 I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS.
28368 It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is.
28369 The whole restaurant is open...I wish it had a little more space, but that is ok.  First, the Tuscan Pie is to die for!!
28370 It has prosciutto, Gorgonzola, apple, arugula, a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on top...at least I think that is what it is...I need to check the menu...but anyways its FABULOUS!!!
28371 I wish I could eat it everyday!
28372 I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too!
28373 Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too!
28374 The staff is so nice and friendly.
28375 I get this to go all the time and bring it home...and I have shared this with my friends too.
28376 I love good Italian pizza and its great!
28377 I love this place they do the best job, I even drive 45 min because I moved and they are worth it!
28378 I'm always happy with the results.
28379 My nails don't lift or chip.
28380 I have also had a facial their and it was amazing.
28381 It was my first facial however I was happy and it wasn't expensive.
28382 I would recommend this place to anyone.
28383 Just bring cash for your tip, they do take cards but not for tips.
28384 My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.
28385 I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.
28386 She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.
28387 I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.
28388 Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.
28389 She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.
28390 They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).
28391 Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.
28392 What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.
28393 So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!
28394 I did not replace the thermostat, though.
28395 Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.
28396 I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.
28397 FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.
28398 I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.
28399 I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.
28400 Guess what that fuse is for?
28401 The RADIATOR FANS!
28402 Imagine that.
28403 Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.
28404 The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.
28405 The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).
28406 Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.
28407 The larger strip fuses were still decent.
28408 The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.
28409 The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!
28410 Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.
28411 Problem solved!
28412 I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.
28413 What great customer service!
28414 So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!
28415 She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.
28416 I absolutely love this sub shop!
28417 Its the only place i will get a sub sandwich!
28418 I have been going here for over 10 years and i NEVER get tired of it!
28419 Mitch is an awesome owner and he really cares about the customer!
28420 MUST GO!
28421 I'm one of those people that loves frozen yogurt.
28422 Anything that taste this great and is this guilt-free will get me every time.
28423 The Golden Spoon has a variety of flavors of fro-yo, and each delicious flavor is only 88 calories per 4 ounces.
28424 This is good news, my friends.
28425 On top of that, the price is very reasonable.
28426 I got the mini (which is 4 ounces) and it rang up to $2.14.
28427 When I compare it to Desert Swirl (your other choice of fro-yo on the Westside), this is extraordinarily more affordable.
28428 The service was not overly friendly, but just fine.
28429 The ice cream chick was happy to give us some samples.
28430 I highly recommend the Heath flavored fro-yo.
28431 Delicious.
28432 After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done.
28433 I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips.
28434 After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place.
28435 The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them.
28436 I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill.
28437 He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school...
28438 I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else.
28439 They also did a poor job.
28440 I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers.
28441 Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them.
28442 Don't waste your time here.
28443 We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued, so we went inside - that's how we found Kazimierz.
28444 Once our eyes adjusted (it's dark inside, like any good speakeasy), I loved the decor.
28445 It's a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make.
28446 We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.
28447 Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.
28448 BOTTLES OF WINE.
28449 I'm sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.
28450 We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda).
28451 Yum.
28452 We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly, apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side.
28453 IT WAS $7.
28454 Between the $8 bottle of wine and that, I felt like I was stealing from these people.
28455 The bartenders were great, as so was the music.
28456 I will, without question, be going back.
28457 This place is a lil bit of awesomeness!
28458 The food was great, the service was awesome, and the atmosphere was very nice!
28459 What's not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service.
28460 They do a great job!
28461 My old dry cleaner was always destroying buttons on my shirts.
28462 Never happens at Titan.
28463 Friendly staff, too.
28464 Also, good place to have alterations & shoe repairs next door...in the back of a barber shop.
28465 We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far.
28466 We've been here probably a dozen times.
28467 It's always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be.
28468 Yum!
28469 Was at Zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still.
28470 Started with the crepes again, perfect again.
28471 Then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner.
28472 I'm not usually a huge fan of lamb OR scallops but they were recommended and I was feeling adventurous.
28473 The lamb -  AMAZING.
28474 Melt in your mouth wonderful.
28475 More like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta.
28476 Their bread is perfect French bread too.
28477 This time of year (winter) there is a festive, buzzy energy with a good crowd but not TOO long of a wait.
28478 Make reservations though for sure.
28479 Oh, and Bobby's across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a pre-dinner drink (400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day).
28480 Baiz Market is a "Mediterranean" type restaurant, or "Arabic" type food.
28481 Well, you could get confused and call it that.
28482 The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch.
28483 This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food.
28484 The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from.
28485 Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.
28486 This place is unique because they make their own bread!
28487 Are you kidding me?
28488 I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years.
28489 The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread.
28490 One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well.
28491 I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area.
28492 Why haven't the other restaurants caught on?
28493 I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).
28494 I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away.
28495 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.
28496 If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think.
28497 I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation.
28498 Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly.
28499 This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.
28500 I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus.
28501 The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions.
28502 Wow.
28503 The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender.
28504 It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender.
28505 Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had.
28506 The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus.
28507 This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.
28508 I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so.
28509 If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out.
28510 Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15.
28511 The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting.
28512 The single best ribs I've ever had at any restaurant.
28513 This place is brand new and off to a great start.
28514 The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful.
28515 I'll be back here!
28516 Yum yum yum!
28517 Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants!
28518 This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes.
28519 You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August.
28520 I have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent.
28521 The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip.
28522 All three are the bomb!
28523 My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga.
28524 Do not order this though if you can't handle spicy stuff.
28525 but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this!
28526 Everyday they have good lunch specials.
28527 I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99.
28528 For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce.
28529 What a deal!
28530 And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons.
28531 And best of all, kids eat free!
28532 And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too.
28533 I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is.
28534 But the margaritas are on point!
28535 LOVE the Four Peaks.
28536 Can get crowded as hell, and parking is a bit of a cluster F, but I've never ever not had a fun night there.
28537 The beer is excellent, the service has always been attentive, and the food is above normal bar standards
28538 The fish and battered fries was very good, the tartar sauce is good, but ask for the cocktail sauce .
28539 .
28540 .
28541 it's fantastic.
28542 Heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose!
28543 And the Rueben might just be the best in town.
28544 The happy hour is great.
28545 $3 locally brewed pints?
28546 Sign me up
28547 The location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points.
28548 I had family in town this week, and I like to take out of towners to places that have a local AZ vibe.
28549 They definitely got a taste of MY Arizona.
28550 Next time they'll have to come during Pumpkin Porter season
28551 A burger?
28552 With anything I want?
28553 FINE....I'll do it.
28554 I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.)
28555 Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat.
28556 And eat well.
28557 I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall.
28558 Not sure how long it's been open.
28559 Perhaps it was the grand opening?
28560 It was PACKED!
28561 But I digress.
28562 As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint.
28563 They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners.
28564 And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)
28565 You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.
28566 Ordering your burger isnt a gong show.
28567 Fairly easy.
28568 All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!
28569 My food was delicious.
28570 Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc.
28571 The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time.
28572 Soft, perfect and lovely.
28573 That's how these fries felt.
28574 Ok that sounded weird.
28575 Tough.
28576 Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!!
28577 EFFING AWESOME!
28578 I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!
28579 !
28580 (I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).
28581 Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again.
28582 Oh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind?
28583 YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!
28584 Came here with the hubs- and we love the place :)  We were able to eat here for significantly less dinero than you typically spend at any other sushi restaurant.
28585 The food comes by on the conveyer belts and the items are price coded by the color plate they are on.
28586 At the end of your meal you just add up the plates for your total.
28587 Each plate comes with 4-6 pieces of sushi- and they also have salads, desserts, appetizers, etc on the belt.
28588 If you are afraid that the sushi has been on the belt for too long or there is something else that you would like that isn't currently on display you can order direct from the bar.
28589 Win win :)
28590 On top of how good the food is, their customer service is excellent.
28591 I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever.
28592 He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table.
28593 He was very nice, and very helpful.
28594 He had extensive knowledge of the menu.
28595 He was also very personable.
28596 He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one.
28597 He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces.
28598 He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise!
28599 I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.
28600   Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce.
28601 They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation.
28602 A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.
28603    I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was!
28604 Great job to whoever hired him.
28605   The food was delicious, I love their fries!
28606 Unlike anything you can get anywhere else.
28607 I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite).
28608 All of their sauces are so good; it's hard to choose just one!
28609 (And no matter how many times I go there, I always sample each one again).
28610   All positive things to say about this Famous Daves!
28611 Oh- and I forgot to mention the corn muffins...beyond words!
28612 Seriously, you have to try them.
28613 Now I'm craving one, and I'm pretty sure they're not open at 3:00 a.m.
28614 I wish I could order them by the dozen haha
28615 I called several pool service companies before choosing Desert Gator Pool Service.
28616 When we bought our house I insisted to my husband that we could take care of the pool...all we needed was someone to come check the chemicals once a month.
28617 Oh sure.
28618 After about one week, mustard algae, a bad storm, and a cranky pool pump, we were looking for a pool guy.
28619 We called them on a Saturday and the owner of Desert Gator was kind enough to come to our home at 6:00am the following Monday to fit with our schedules.
28620 We had our service set up that week and have been very happy ever since.
28621 They definitely got our pool under control and taught us quite a bit along the way.
28622 We still have them coming once every week - it's so worth it.
28623 Our pool was in bad shape after a recent storm and they were incredibly responsive.
28624 I think they came two or three times that week without charging us more.
28625 $85 per month...but can be a bit more if you need parts and chemicals.
28626 I'm sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.
28627 We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.
28628 It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.
28629 The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.
28630 The beer menu looked fabulous.
28631 So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.
28632 We hope this turns around.
28633 The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the "hood".
28634 Good rates
28635 Great location- near food, shopping
28636 Quiet area
28637 Rooms have kitchens
28638 Free Wifi and Breakfast
28639 For a business traveler these are the big selling points- it's kinda basic but loads of features.
28640 Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.
28641 Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.
28642 It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.
28643 It is so comfortable and wide open.
28644 Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.
28645 The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.
28646 You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!
28647 The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee.
28648 Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.
28649 It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard.
28650 If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there.
28651 Great gluten free Italian place!
28652 Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!
28653 I can't believe some of the things I've been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant!
28654 I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint!
28655 I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up!
28656 The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server!
28657 He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far.
28658 We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari.
28659 I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!
28660 For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server!
28661 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
28662 My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned!
28663 Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices!
28664 VERY IMPRESSED!
28665 Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere!
28666 And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places!
28667 Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!
28668 This is by far the best farmer's market I've been to in the Valley.
28669 Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into.
28670 McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so it's ok if you don't get there first thing.
28671 It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.
28672 Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available.
28673 Phoenician's outstanding loaves were only $3.
28674 You're welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry.
28675 We enjoyed Digestif's Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.
28676 Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit.
28677 Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings,
28678 It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.
28679 If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, I'll be here for sure every week until the season ends in May.
28680 UNBELIEVABLE!!
28681 so enraged and appalled!!
28682 i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a mani-pedi.
28683 after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips.
28684 the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails -- she's 91, did not understand the gal's "english" and can't hear, so i presume she nodded.
28685 after mom paid the charge of $60 and i picked her up (i had another appt.)
28686 she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a mani-pedi.
28687 i called and was told the normal charge is $30 w/$5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake.
28688 we did and the whole group of technicians said it was mom's fault for saying "yes" and would not concede AT ALL -- not in the slightest.
28689 i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of.
28690 i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearing-impaired customers to not use this business.
28691 TO ME and of course to mom, it was such a slam on the elderly.
28692 mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way.
28693 VERY BAD BUSINESS!!
28694 !
28695 Been here 4 times in the past 6 months.
28696 I love bringing out-of-towners here.
28697 Excellent art and history exhibits specifically related to Native Americans from the southwestern United States.
28698 Reasonably priced entrance fee.
28699 Go on the tour - they will tell you really interesting things about each of the exhibits you otherwise wouldn't know - makes the visit much more enjoyable.
28700 A must see for visitors to Phoenix!
28701 As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.
28702 Then you see the special board which read "Good Food Takes Time" and there is a clock next to that.
28703 Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our "good food" it came out and was awful.
28704 My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.
28705 $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.
28706 The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal.
28707 This review is for the food only.
28708 If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that aren't food related you'll have to check out another review.
28709 I love LGO.
28710 The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things you've never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.
28711 It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.
28712 I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.
28713 Also, if you're in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!
28714 What a great little find especially for Phoenix!
28715 I've been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem!
28716 Recently  I took my mother and we had delicious Singapore Noodles and Malaysian Rice Noodles (which are kind of like Thai's Rad Na but better).
28717 On another occasion my husband ordered Pork Belly Curry and really loved it.
28718 I wasn't as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style.
28719 Family owned, quiet, and very affordable.
28720 You have to really look for this place since its in a shopping center(its on the north side of Shea between 70th & 71st St in Scottsdale).
28721 Great early bird dinners as well!
28722 Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?
28723 It was so disgustingly dirty inside.
28724 Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.
28725 I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before.
28726 Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left.
28727 Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings.
28728 There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this.
28729 It's downright unsanitary.
28730 You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake.
28731 I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews.
28732 I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos.
28733 Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch!
28734 Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left.
28735 I'll be back to try more things next time I'm in the area!
28736 I love me some coffee.
28737 The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work.
28738 If you want something sweet, order the iced raspberry mocha.
28739 Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you're drinking syrup.
28740 The muffins are moist and delicious.
28741 The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing (yes, they make spinach salad at this coffee place).
28742 The best part about this place?
28743 It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave.
28744 I can't wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered.
28745 It isn't often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad, but last night I decided to have dinner there.
28746 I'll be completely honest, service is always a mixed bag.
28747 But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server.
28748 However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table.
28749 Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.
28750 If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!!
28751 And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)!
28752 Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back.
28753 Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!
28754 !
28755 And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously.
28756 This wendy's is terrible.
28757 I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting.
28758 This one is just a slow, disgusting chain.
28759 Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else.
28760 FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot!
28761 Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it!
28762 We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese!
28763 The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS!
28764 The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didn't taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate!
28765 LOL
28766 Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time.
28767 Service was ok, wasn't anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!
28768 They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.
28769 That's the first time I've heard about this.
28770 Arai pastry is so delicious!
28771 ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats!
28772 The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites.
28773 But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes
28774 that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes
28775 yes yes
28776 i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy
28777 I ADORE this place.
28778 Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago.
28779 They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed!
28780 Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, "I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."
28781 Everything is delicious.
28782 I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing.
28783 If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff.
28784 Try the bacon.
28785 What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food, or the view?
28786 I know, I'll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements -- meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian.
28787 He didn't duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway, instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself.
28788 He was so incredibly personable.
28789 He could have easily ignored us.
28790 I'm sure he's approached on a regular basis now that he's such a TV personality.
28791 But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona.
28792 Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen!
28793 He proudly showed off the latest upgrades.
28794 Sure, there were new gadgets, but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day.
28795 How cool is that?
28796 And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen.
28797 Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about.
28798 There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors.
28799 This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product.
28800 Talk about mouth watering.
28801 Here's hoping that I will one day get to sit at that table.
28802 I love the lakes!
28803 Yes it's a lake in the desert!
28804 Dragon Boat, Outrigger, and Marathons!
28805 It's the place to do it.
28806 Not sure about the fishing part, but I do see people fishing there.
28807 What are they trying to catch hmmm??
28808 I enjoy running there on a nightly basis and so should you.
28809 South side is probably the most scenic, but not to say the North side is bad.
28810 If you're a fellow photographer I would definitely recommend this place during the evenings :)
28811 I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp!
28812 wants me to give at least one.
28813 I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences.
28814 The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food!
28815 True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner.
28816 I saw all the reviews about the "bad service" , but I paid more attention to the "Cheap" and  "Delicious Pho" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it.
28817 Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.
28818 I was excited.
28819 It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down.
28820 The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register.
28821 After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order.
28822 I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her.
28823 I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation.
28824 For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck.
28825 But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more.
28826 I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough.
28827 The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant.
28828 We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either.
28829 Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment.
28830 We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review.
28831 I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals.
28832 Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House.
28833 I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food.
28834 I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night.
28835 Okay,talk about coincidences....
28836 The other day I was compli-chatting with fellow yelper Jarvis about hard to find music.
28837 Today I run into a past acquaintence while out and about.
28838 How do either of these tie into a review of Boom Boom La Rue's?
28839 Okay,follow along if you will.
28840 So I run into this past acquaintence who's apparently had a bit of a rough week.She tells me about finding this store in the middle of a bad day and it immediately turned her frown upside down.
28841 She's raving about it.Then she tells me she has a yelp account and has added a review.
28842 I tell her I too have some reviews on yelp.
28843 Today I'm in that neck of the woods and so I stop in.
28844 Holy hell!
28845 This place is a drag queen's delight!
28846 It's insanely glitterific and there are beaded dresses and sequined accessories everywhere.
28847 Not anything I can personally do anything with,but I did manage to pick up a few things as gifts for friends.
28848 And none of it broke the bank.
28849 What does this have to do with my convo with Jarvis?
28850 A day or so ago we were discussing hard to find music and I brought up Nina Hagen.
28851 The sales girl in this store was a DEAD RINGER for Nina Hagen!!!
28852 !
28853 Flame red spikey hair and clothes right out of 1978 pure punk rock!
28854 That took me back to the good old days for sure.
28855 She knew the stock,was able to make excellent suggestions by asking specific questions and wasn't the least bit pushy.
28856 She was able to attend to  several customers at the same time and created a very social atmosphere for everyone there.
28857 For someplace I didn't expect to feel comfortable in,it was a pleasant surprise.
28858 While there wasn't anything there I would feel the need to buy for myself,I could see going back again and again to get gifts for friends.
28859 A great experience.
28860 We took our grandson (Sebastian) to the park for a thoroughly enjoyable visit.
28861 Sebastian wasn't too sure about the carousel, but the train ride put a smile all over his face.
28862 The visit to the Presidential railroad car was fun and educational for the adults.
28863 Sebastian liked it too.
28864 So.
28865 After 8 years of owning a Ford, it left me stranded on the road one to many times.
28866 So I bought a '06 Hyundai Elentra (from a different location).
28867 Ive never owned a foreign car, this car appealed to me because of the low miles and still had a warranty.
28868 Well....it started to act a little funny.
28869 So I called up Discover Hyundai, as they are miles from my work.
28870 I spoke to Tim in the service department and he was more then helpful.
28871 They had to keep the car for 2 days, because they couldn't get it to do what I was telling them it was doing...but they were persistent and finally were able to duplicate my issue.
28872 Everything was under my warranty.
28873 I was back on the road by the end of day 2!
28874 I will for sure be going back here for all normal maintenance and if any other issues arise.
28875 Thanks Tim!
28876 I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars just to keep people out of here- that's how much of a gem my bf and I think this place is.
28877 The not only have a more spacious theater, a bar, food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids (crappy, but it's there and basically just a bonus in my opinion) but they have 3 flavors of popcorn...3!
28878 Holy bajesus- we go for the Carmel popcorn alone.
28879 I don't even think we have had the regular or the cheese ever, maybe once.
28880 We go out of our way to go there just for that.
28881 This place is never that busy which I don't understand.
28882 Oh, and another plus, it's not the Tween's hangout on Friday nights.
28883 I will admit, we buy the living social or grouping every time we go there ($15 for 2 tix and 1 popcorn), but they already have our business.
28884 You idiots who review a place after going to a highly publicized premier like the Hunger Games that you bought with a Groupon are just that...IDIOTS.
28885 No one wants to listen to your nitpicking, go to a useless site like Yahoo Local that no one reads so you don't have to make society dumber for listening to your complaining.
28886 My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum.
28887 Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go.
28888 I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.
28889 Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.
28890 As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.
28891 The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.
28892 I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.
28893 I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.
28894 Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.
28895 I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.
28896 The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.
28897 Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.
28898 If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.
28899 There are still so many more dishes to try as well, but that will be for another trip.
28900 Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant.
28901 I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap..
28902 I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing.
28903 They serve New Mexico cuisine here.
28904 The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans.
28905 I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant.
28906 The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.
28907 Very consistent food.
28908 Definitely a second best to P.F.
28909 Chang's.
28910 My wife and i just dined at this restaurant.
28911 I am a chef and must say that Chef Chris's concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.
28912 Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.
28913 What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course.
28914 Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!
28915 Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo.
28916 I am very particular about where I go for sushi.
28917 I can name ten places I will not go to, and have struggled to find a place to frequent; until now.
28918 I have only been here about 5 times, but every time was a great experience.
28919 Great food, staff, prices,and atmosphere.
28920 My trip was inspired by Adam Richmond's visit and while I couldn't do the 12 slider challenge, I knocked out 5 and was close to taking on a 6th.
28921 The GM stopped by to check on us and the waitress was great!
28922 Be sure to grab some fresh baked deli treats before heading out.
28923 Wine, booze and cigars.
28924 And friendly staff.
28925 There's not much else that needs to be said.
28926 Oh and great prices.
28927 The selection and prices they offer are great.
28928 The aisles are wide and clearly marked.
28929 The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low.
28930 Any time I have out of town visitors who want "real" Mexican, I take them here.
28931 The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree!
28932 I've eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me.
28933 The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth.
28934 The ONLY downside is the location.
28935 Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it.
28936 Go there anyway!
28937 Just try lunch time first.
28938 Okay, did I say bad?
28939 ?
28940 WORSE.
28941 Negative five stars.
28942 From San Diego,
28943 1. they made us wait in line for ticketing.
28944 2.
28945 Made us go check our bags
28946 3.
28947 Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the "special needs" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight.
28948 4.
28949 Booked another flight.
28950 Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us.
28951 She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).
28952 5.
28953 Got on the runway.
28954 Plane circled around for about an hour.
28955 didn't take off.
28956 6.
28957 "mechanical problems".
28958 7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour.
28959 8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.
28960 9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)
28961 10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD.
28962 11.
28963 We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover.
28964 12.
28965 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me?
28966 13.
28967 THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE.
28968 ~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:
28969 LAX to Tokyo: "mechanical problems"
28970 stayed another hour on the plane.
28971 Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere.
28972 Lost luggage on the way there.
28973 It fell out of a bus!
28974 Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea.
28975 Seriously, you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?
28976 !
28977 Sorry Delta, I'm so exhausted, sick and tired of you.
28978 F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too.
28979 I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.
28980 Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.
28981 Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.
28982 I love everything about it.
28983 Wongs is my comfort food.
28984 An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me.
28985 I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again.
28986 However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately.
28987 The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage.
28988 Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory.
28989 We were seated immediately.
28990 Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time.
28991 He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is).
28992 Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out.
28993 We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed.
28994 Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls.
28995 When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left.
28996 Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.
28997 I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce.
28998 It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily.
28999 Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.
29000 Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?
29001 This is the ONLY place my wife and I will buy furniture from, absolutely fantastic!
29002 My wife and I spent a better part of a month looking for a TV stand for our living room.
29003 Everything we came across was cheap and prefabricated.
29004 We stumbled on Sweet Potatoes while on our way home from another local store.
29005 The owner was extremely friendly and helpful.
29006 We found a couple things we liked but not the size we needed.
29007 The owner told us the pieces we were looking at are locally made and offered to call and see if they could custom make one.
29008 Not only did they agree but the price we were given was 200 dollars less than anything else we were looking at.
29009 We have since received the piece and could not be happier!
29010 My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area.
29011 I decided I'd let him choose where we'd go out even though I'd never ever heard of this place before.
29012 It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center).
29013 When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up.
29014 It's definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time.
29015 We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience.
29016 We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth.
29017 We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll.
29018 They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren't on the menu.
29019 The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good!
29020 My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city.
29021 I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour.
29022 I love Taste Of China.
29023 I eat here at least once a week.
29024 Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small.
29025 Also, they are incredibly fast.
29026 If order for pick-up, it's ready in 5 minutes.
29027 Should I order delivery, it only takes 10-15 for the food to get to my house.
29028 My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tso's chicken.
29029 Have been there several times.
29030 I'm quite fussy about where I eat and quick to condemn, so my continued custom says it all.
29031 You'll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.
29032 The decor hasn't been updated in at least 20 years.
29033 Looks like it's falling apart.
29034 The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.
29035 This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.
29036 The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).
29037 The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldn't find them.
29038 Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.
29039 Service was interesting.
29040 The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.
29041 The price wasn't bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.
29042 I'd rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street.
29043 First, I'm sorry this review is lengthy, but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go.
29044 I entered Mimi's Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever.
29045 I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food.
29046 i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out.
29047 i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle.
29048 She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before.
29049 i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide.
29050 She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley "where's the fire?
29051 take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?"
29052 wine was a perfect idea!
29053 I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine.
29054 i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine.
29055 When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news.
29056 Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help.
29057 It was just the olive branch i needed.
29058 Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better.
29059 i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion.
29060 finally my food was ready.
29061 She boxed everything with care for the drive home.
29062 All this time smiling.
29063 i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange.
29064 She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe.
29065 This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20.
29066 The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right.
29067 i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty.
29068 The food was tasty and just what i needed.
29069 Mimi's Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table, and if Mimi's Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle.
29070 This is quite literally the best burger I have ever eaten.
29071 The rocket bacon cheeseburger with 3 patties of meat on a 10 in.
29072 sesame sub roll and is nothing short of amazing.
29073 It could easily be shared.
29074 The cheese fries and onion rings are homemade.
29075 We love the casual environment and the huge selection of glass bottled soda.
29076 To top it off the prices are amazing!
29077 This is our first time here but we are hooked.
29078 We would love to see this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, DDDinfo@mac.com, so if you love it here, nominate it!
29079 A real gem!
29080 Unprofessional, disorganized, and extremely low end care.
29081 Should be called The Bad Egg.
29082 Bottom line, the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there.
29083 We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated.
29084 The staff was pleasant enough.
29085 We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet).
29086 We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again.
29087 She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee.
29088 We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor.
29089 Our food arrived about ten minutes after that.
29090 The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream.
29091 Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought.
29092 It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce.
29093 The waitress never checked on us once during the meal.
29094 She came back by the time my husband was finished.
29095 I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way).
29096 She offered me something else.
29097 By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick.
29098 My meal was comped and we did get an apology.
29099 The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled.
29100 The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes.
29101 Blech.
29102 Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees.
29103 Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere.
29104 We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here, the place was packed.
29105 Never the less, the service was impeccable as always.
29106 This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed.
29107 I had the 14 Oz.
29108 NY strip and my wife had the prime rib.
29109 Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully!
29110 My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere...can't vouch as I hate the stuff.
29111 From the bread to the desert, every bite was worth taking.
29112 The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red "leather"?
29113 booths are welcoming.
29114 It's pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis, no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine...(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer, it is worth every single cent.
29115 So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?).
29116 HA!
29117 Big mistake.
29118 Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.
29119 The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people).
29120 And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.
29121 I'll keep this update short and sweet:
29122 $3 for a CAN OF SODA?
29123 Get real.
29124 I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something.
29125 But a can?
29126 COME ON.
29127 You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it.
29128 FAIL.
29129 Your servers: IDIOTS.
29130 First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders.
29131 Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again.
29132 Did you forget?
29133 Were you not paying attention the first time we around?
29134 Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks?
29135 And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them.
29136 FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD.
29137 Very, very bad.
29138 Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD.
29139 VERY, VERY BAD.
29140 Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK.
29141 TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD.
29142 Do you hear that, St. Francis?
29143 BAD.
29144 Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda).
29145 Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us.
29146 Excluding tip.
29147 BAD.
29148 Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try.
29149 Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy "I don't split checks", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well.
29150 Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us.
29151 A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky.
29152 Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here.
29153 NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!
29154 SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN!
29155 The 3 of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday.
29156 No, we didn't have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids.
29157 The beginning is a bit dry.
29158 You're in the "classroom" for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows.
29159 Moo.
29160 After that, it's a hay ride.
29161 Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.
29162 Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.
29163 Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.
29164 Once the hayride was over, the "tour" was officially over.
29165 But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo.
29166 The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.
29167 There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.
29168 Yum...just kidding.
29169 In addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.
29170 This dog would make an incredible soccer player.
29171 His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.
29172 After the animal bonding, we went to try flavored milk.
29173 Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok.
29174 I was disappointed that the milk wasn't fresh from the farm but I guess it's not legal to serve unprocessed milk.
29175 Since we had a Groupon, we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream.
29176 At $2.50 each, I would never pay for them individually.
29177 But seeing that it was included in my "deal," we enjoyed them a lot.
29178 Don't be embarrassed if you don't have kids.
29179 Trust me, adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too.
29180 I love going to this store whether its for just for the latest copy of guitar world, some strings, or a new guitar, the guy johnny is my main man lol he always gives me good deals and generally makes me and any one else i take there feel like we are the only customers, (in a good way!)
29181 every one remembers you and asks you how your day is going great "mom and pop" feel.
29182 95 reviews?
29183 Guess there's nothing I can say about this gem that hasn't been said.
29184 We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good.
29185 We also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon, tomatoes and fresh basil.
29186 The vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well.
29187 They included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew I was staying at a hotel.
29188 They were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us.
29189 It says on their website and on the yelp search engine that Pizza A Metro delivers but they don't.
29190 Not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself.
29191 Love love love this place.
29192 Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?
29193 My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.
29194 I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be.
29195 haha
29196 See ya there!
29197 When I get the urge to eat out, I'm normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal.
29198 With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and S'mores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place.
29199 My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything.
29200 My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious!
29201 I'd say they've got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned.
29202 And the cornbread is probably the best I've had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event.
29203 The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful.
29204 I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!
29205 The place did not disappoint.
29206 The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area.
29207  It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of)
29208 But yeah, the portions were overwhelming, and best of all?
29209 The food was spectacular.
29210 I sat outside, but honestly?
29211 I think the place is pretty both ways, so don't be too stingy on the location :)
29212 Jus go.
29213 They get 5 stars for the only thing I have ever had there.
29214 Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena.
29215 It is out of this world.
29216 It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner.
29217 This dude claims he "steals souls for a living" and is "the best photographer".
29218 In the world.
29219 Ever.
29220 http://www.flickr.com/people/tysoncrosbie/
29221 I promise--there is nothing at all vain, hacky, narcissistic, overpriced or arrogant, whatsosever, about Tyson Crosby or his work.
29222 Phoenix should consider itself fortunate to be home to such a phenomenally over-talented, artistic genius.
29223 Big art cities like NYC, Chicago and LA would never be able to fully appreciate the photographic brilliance of the one, the only, the premier best photographer in the world-Tyson Crosby.
29224 Humble, poetic and unpretentious as he may be, I can't argue with him.
29225 The fist time I saw a Tyson Crosbie image, I j!zzed in my pants.
29226 Really, his work is that good.
29227 For real.
29228 No joke.
29229 I'm serious.
29230 Totally serious.
29231 I love his work so much, I want to marry a Tyson Crosby print.
29232 Where is the button for 5 million stars?!!
29233 !
29234 Vegetarian/Vegan south Indian buffet!
29235 Guilt free conscience!
29236 What more could a girl want?
29237 I am in LOVE with the dosas.
29238 I always wish I had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food.
29239 Udupi is proof that being vegan/vegetarian can be tasty and cruelty-free.
29240 Humble ambiance, no fancy decorations.
29241 Wood fired pizzas, scrumptious pasta dishes and bacon wrapped shrimp.
29242 How can you go wrong with a place that wraps things in bacon.
29243 C'mon, even  veggies admit that things wrapped in bacon are good!
29244 Has a smokey atmosphere and a slight bar crowd but the food is outstanding.
29245 I give this location no love.
29246 We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.
29247 Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.
29248 When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.
29249 The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.
29250 She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.
29251 This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.
29252 Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.
29253 And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!
29254 YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!
29255 Dr Norton and his staff are friendly and professional.
29256 They have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable.
29257 I highly recommend this office.
29258 This speakeasy was kickass.
29259 The staff is super down to earth and the menu is great.
29260 The drive thru is an awesome touch.
29261 I got the Turkey Club and it was reallllllly good.
29262 We received 2 randomly free samples of a shake and smoothie and had some good conversation with the guys behind the counter.
29263 It gets a little noisy if they're makin shakes in there, and the seating is pretty limited.
29264 I wish they were open later but so far I'm loving it!
29265 Qver-priced, substandard food.
29266 Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).
29267 Small portions of tired, room temperature "fry-pieces",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.
29268 Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.
29269 Waste of $$$!
29270 What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.
29271 It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get, now you just have to settle for what they have.
29272 This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.
29273 I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!
29274 !
29275 Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!
29276 Love the food here.
29277 Been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish.
29278 Thai iced tea was great as well.
29279 Only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far.
29280 Went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too.
29281 Service was fast, prompt and nice.
29282 Will be back again to try other dishes.
29283 Unique selection of antiques, linen and assorted pictures and estate jewlery along with new timeless designs.
29284 Located in downtown Gilbert worth the trip!
29285 Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products.
29286 Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations.
29287 You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10.
29288 They have dog crates for training and you don't have to shell out a fortune for them.
29289 They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank.
29290 If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals!
29291 Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products.
29292 As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center).
29293 So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US.

29295 My wife and I went to Harris Dental for a few years when we lived in Scottsdale.
29296 We moved out of town in 2009 but we have never forgotten the superb dental care that we received from Dr. Joe Harris (who had come highly recommended from our Austin, TX dentist as a person who keeps up wth dental research).
29297 Nor have we forgotten the fabulous and uniformly cheerful staff.
29298 So it wasn't really too surprising that we received a call from Harris Dental a few days ago - more than three years after we moved away - asking for permission to archive our dental x-rays and asking where they might send funds from a credit to our account.
29299 Who does that?
29300 We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.
29301 It was an expensive model priced over $3K.
29302 After 2.5 short months it stopped working.
29303 The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.
29304 When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.
29305 Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.
29306 I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service.
29307 Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.
29308 Extremely bad customer service on this one.
29309 I'm completely impressed by The Mission and I can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.
29310 My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.
29311 Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.
29312 Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.
29313 The bread pudding was EASILY the best I've ever had.
29314 We usually don't order desserts and I'm glad we did, because I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was.
29315 My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).
29316 Since I'm pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their "Sophia Loren" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!
29317 It was delicious and I'll certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)
29318 Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????
29319 I NEED this in my house!
29320 a G Spot is a myth.
29321 and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist.
29322 So its no surprise that I couldn't find the Gelato Spot either.
29323 Shannon spouts, "I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it".
29324 Hmmm, that's interesting
29325 I drove in and around the dirt road
29326 ... and went up and down Scottsdale
29327 ... explored the box
29328 ... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark
29329 ... manually googled it
29330 ... orally asked the passerbys
29331 Road several times and I couldn't find it ANYWHERE
29332 Maybe I need to do more research.
29333 Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group
29334 *** UPDATE  ***
29335 Its on Shea Blvd??
29336 No wonder I couldn't find it-
29337 I was looking down the wrong road
29338 *** UPDATE  ***
29339 Thanks Jake P for "Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... "
29340 BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.
29341 i.e.
29342 g- spot is hard to find
29343 *** UPDATE  ***
29344 Now I have a girl, "Shannon W", telling me where g-spot is.
29345 She writes,
29346 "It's on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle."
29347 Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.
29348 i.e.
29349 g-spots are hard to find
29350 THis place is great!
29351 I need an adjustment every now and then but I live in Scottsdale and my regular Chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time, so if I tweek my back unexpectedly I can't get in soon enough quite often.
29352 So.. now I have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal Chiro.
29353 I have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen Dr. Brian and they love him.
29354 So if you need a good Chiro... go see these guys any day of the week.
29355 Try em you'll love em!
29356 What are you all talking about?!
29357 This place is awful.
29358 Theres a reason why these sandwiches are $3.
29359 I can't believe so many people like this place, (although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables.
29360 From what they said, there was meat on there too,  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there.
29361 This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities).
29362 Please, homeless people, save your quarters, you're too good for this place.
29363 They have good milkshakes, but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying "rich people" milk shakes anyways, stick with the dollar menu.
29364 I have taken acting classes from Verve Studios on and off for four years, and have recently returned for another work out!
29365 Amanda is a true professional,  a working Actor herself,and gets the actor to be real, not "act".
29366 Do not miss this opportunity to learn and grow, AND have fun.
29367 Lawannah Curry
29368 Phoenix Az
29369 Good JIB.
29370 Fast an friendly.
29371 I LOVE this place!
29372 From the moment you walk up to the door, it is spotless.
29373 Sometimes you will be approached by an employee asking if you need assistance, majority of the time, you won't talk to one employee, which is great!
29374 I just want to go in, get what I need, and peace out until next time without the small chatter.
29375 Their hummus is AMAZING, along with a few of the prepackaged meals.
29376 Their Creamy Cilantro Salad Dressing is OMG AMAZING!
29377 !
29378 Sweet tea... LOVE IT!
29379 !
29380 This place is great for a big group of people.
29381 We originally thought we were going to have 6 people.
29382 We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up.
29383 The staff was more than happy to accommodate us.
29384 The Kota Athenian chicken is very good.
29385 The price range is moderate.
29386 All in all a fantastic place.
29387 Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC.
29388 She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better.
29389 Her new location is adorable.
29390 I highly recommend her!
29391 I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy!
29392 First rate atmosphere and food.
29393 The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy.
29394 Wine selection is terrific.
29395 The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful.
29396 The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side.
29397 It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.
29398 OK, Where do I start?
29399 This place is AMAZING!
29400 I love the food here, especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time!
29401 Forget about the movie theater popcorn, you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie!
29402 Before the movie starts, a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order, usually during the previews.
29403 During the movie, you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order.
29404 About nearing the end of the movie, you will get your check, so make sure that if you want more food, get your orders in before the movie is over.
29405 Pricing is good, it costs about the same as  a dinner and a movie separately, why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once?
29406 The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE, as long as you get the love seat, or leather seats, just don't get the "office chair" seats, as those are like....sitting in an office chair for 3 hours watching a movie ;).
29407 I've been in a handful of times, and last night was also no disappointment.
29408 After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM???
29409 Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead.
29410 Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up.
29411 Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge.
29412 But good ol' cosmopolitan-cool AZ88 was next on my list, where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir (and Tempranillo), cheese plate (their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night), and warm and friendly convo with spot-on bartender Steen.
29413 Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion.
29414 They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool.
29415 I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change.
29416 They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley).
29417 Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJ's mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully.
29418 I'm now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs, as they've shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do.
29419 This place is pure crap!
29420 The players are sub-par and un-entertaining,  (especially Mike Clement and Julie Martinez).
29421 , and the door men are ridiculously cheesy, and rude.
29422 I'm a regular at piano bars all over the country when I'm traveling (Pete's Piano Bar in Austin, Howl At The Moon in Scottsdale) and The Big Bang in Tempe is a terrible destination.
29423 Save your tips and bar $ for the aforementioned places and take my word for it.
29424 If we hadn't arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online, I would have checked out.
29425 Furniture missing.
29426 Security bar sheared off.
29427 Faceplates for wiring gone.
29428 Furniture handles missing.
29429 Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadn't been vacuumed.
29430 Two remaining chairs badly stained.
29431 You wouldn't want to sit on them.
29432 No uniforms or name tags on staff.
29433 Pick another chain.
29434 The reviews for the other Ramada's in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things.
29435 WOW.
29436 This places is incredible.
29437 I can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful.
29438 It's the perfect date place, since you can order booze to cure the date jitters.
29439 Also, you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of "man food".
29440 The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY.
29441 The extra care in picking ingredients, grilling/cooking with little fats, and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out.
29442 The decor's nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be.
29443 For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following:  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalapeño or roasted red pepper hummus (PS:  they'll let you order the hummus half and half!)
29444 Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation, and signing off--every so "sincerely" i might add, with: " love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88.
29445 Way to keep it classy over there.....
29446 I am from New York and always asked where do I get best pizza?
29447 Hands down Lamps Pizzeria is the BEST!!!!!!
29448 Always fresh ingredients and friendly staff and owner.
29449 Hertz Gold Club service worked perfectly for me.
29450 My Toyota Corolla, booked over the internet, was in its bay and ready to go.
29451 The buses to and from the rental centre were frequent and painless to use.
29452 Umm this place is awesome.
29453 I got a bike basket for 25 cents.
29454 25 cents!
29455 Too often these days I run into "thrift" stores that miss the thrifty part, but not this one!
29456 It's fun to shop and you may end up finding a truly good deal!
29457 I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit!
29458 The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft!
29459 Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate!
29460 They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new.
29461  I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte.
29462 Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling.
29463 For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.
29464  Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around.
29465 They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee.
29466 I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!
29467   My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts!
29468 The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery.
29469 And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.
29470   Starbucks is a thing of the past.
29471 I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!
29472 I have used Sandella's on three different occasions for catering lunches to business offices.
29473 Jeff ( owner) does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well.
29474 My offices that I bring lunch to love this food fare.
29475 It is a healthy alternative that many of my offices are craving after having so many lunches brought to them that weigh them down and make them feel like going to sleep after lunch.
29476 As a part of our healthcare community this food is something I feel confident about bringing to my colleges and offices that I visit.
29477 It taste great, it is made with only the best ingredient personally selected by Jeff and it is best of all , healthy.
29478 I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.
29479 First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte.
29480 Excellent.
29481 Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try.
29482 Delicious.
29483 The tortilla was as good as everything inside.
29484 Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie.
29485 Bacon and chocolate for the win!
29486 I've been here three times and have not been disappointed.
29487 The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food.
29488 The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.
29489 It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work.
29490 great wine selection except they are always out of greg norman and ive never got to try it
29491 Great fruit and vegetables.
29492 Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value.
29493 Check out the meat and deli.
29494 Cage free chicken and grass fed beef.
29495 Salmon and Tuna are fresh.
29496 They do have some good values here.
29497 The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.
29498 I like their seating area.
29499 It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store.
29500 One of my favorite locations.
29501 As a real estate investor, I need contractors that I can truly count on to get things done for me.
29502 This means that my calls get returned in a timely fashion, work is done properly, quickly and competently but most importantly, that I get quoted a fair price for a good job.
29503 Don't give me drama and definitely, don't give me any bullshit excuses or sales pitches.
29504 I'm so glad to have found David and Tracy.
29505 They run a tight ship, they are extremely professional and I sensed their sincerity from the word hello and I talk to contractors and real estate agents almost every single day.
29506 Thank you for a job well done.
29507 You have definitely made the cut as part of my go to crew, not only for my rental properties but as a highly recommended vendor to my Sonoran desert friends, colleagues and neighbors.
29508 Cheers!
29509 !
29510 I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your "twin peaks" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it.
29511 So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time.
29512 Fries were soggy and our server disappeared.
29513 We all decided were not going back.
29514 Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.
29515 It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel.
29516 Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy.
29517 There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers.
29518 But wait - something's wrong!!
29519 There's no humidity!
29520 Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy!
29521 I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.
29522  The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece.
29523 It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact.
29524 Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers.
29525 The decor is late 50's.
29526 If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly.
29527 The menu consists of "Flavorful American comfort food.
29528 Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist."
29529 There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.
29530  While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls.
29531 These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys.
29532 You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw.
29533 My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy.
29534 There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside.
29535 They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that.
29536 The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert).
29537 Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction.
29538 He loved it.
29539 I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share.
29540 There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood.
29541 The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star.
29542 I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance.
29543 The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.
29544  This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent.
29545 Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code.
29546 So one of our entrees was free!
29547 (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink).
29548 But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.
29549 Love the carne asada.
29550 St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA.
29551 Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.
29552 Goat cheese on crostini follows.
29553 Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.
29554 Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes.
29555 Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass.
29556 Loved it!
29557 Will happily return.
29558 They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.
29559 Truly superior service !
29560 "No."
29561 If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say.
29562 0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.
29563 0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.
29564 In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.
29565 The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.
29566 The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway.
29567 With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.
29568 On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.
29569 On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.
29570 He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.
29571 There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.
29572 Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?
29573 You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?
29574 Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.
29575 The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!
29576 When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.
29577 The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of "I am the only staffperson here..."  I looked at the menu and made my decision.
29578 In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.
29579 This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.
29580 The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.
29581 Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish.
29582 The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception.
29583 6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.
29584 I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order.
29585 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.
29586 He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.
29587 I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad.
29588 Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.
29589 The phone rang again.
29590 Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.
29591 The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.
29592 I asked if he had heard me.
29593 He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.
29594 He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.
29595 I said I would wait.
29596 Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.
29597 6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.
29598 I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.
29599 Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.
29600 The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.
29601 6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.
29602 The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.
29603 6:20 PM, staffperson returns.
29604 He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.
29605 The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.
29606 Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.
29607 On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated "This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish".
29608 I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.
29609 6:25 pm.
29610 As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.
29611 In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.
29612 I stood and left.
29613 While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have "The Best Curry in the Valley",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.
29614 For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.
29615 Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.
29616 My wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load.
29617 Our appointment was scheduled for 8 a.m. not for 8-12 as most places.
29618 He showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well.
29619 Excellent customer service and very friendly.
29620 Thanks again,
29621 Gary
29622 WOW!
29623 I had read and heard alot of good things about Smeeks and I thought, "It must be too good to be true," and while out shopping for a few items today, I was proven wrong.
29624 I walked in and I instantly felt like a kid in a candy store.
29625 They had candy, fun novelties, and I swear everything I looked at it made me think of a friend who would love to find it in their stocking on Christmas day.
29626 The store was packed (it is 3 days before Christmas), but the staff was friendly, helpful and went around to make sure everyone found what they needed or if they needed a basket.
29627 Guys, I'll be back here throughout the year, and you should check it out.
29628 If it doesn't make you smile or make you want to sift through all the goodies, you probably kick kittens for fun (and that's not cool!
29629 ).
29630 My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen.
29631 Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.
29632 The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan.
29633 The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody?
29634 Be sure to ask for "Cha Shu Ramen" to get a few more pieces of pork.
29635 (extra $)
29636 The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?
29637 )Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some "roadhouses."
29638 Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.
29639 It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine.
29640 So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries.
29641 Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries.
29642 I've never have enough room.
29643 If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door.
29644 My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread!
29645 (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)
29646 I think it's too small for groups over six.
29647 Maybe we'll see you there.
29648 Added 11/18/07
29649 I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it.
29650 (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.)
29651 For the basic, ask for "Hakata Ramen."
29652 For extra pork, ask for "Cha-shu-men" or "Cha-shu-ramen."
29653 Either way, there's really not much pork in it.
29654 That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.
29655 Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert.
29656 We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida, but this one was top notch.
29657 Very clean, staff very friendly , and food OMG to die for.
29658 The garlic cheese bread is fantastic, and the calzones are my favorite.
29659 Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.
29660 This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.
29661 Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb.
29662 I also get my thanksgiving turkey here.
29663 ok, let me be straight with you.
29664 i hate paying full price for anything.
29665 yes, i'm one of those people.
29666 i love a coupon.
29667 i love a discount.
29668 and i absolutely love a bargain!
29669 but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store.
29670 i felt really, really dirty when i left this store.
29671 ewwwwww.
29672 this is a yucky ross.
29673 dirty, dirty, dirty!
29674 the floors and clothing racks were filthy.
29675 i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black "stuff" on my hand after touching a clothing rack.
29676 the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was.
29677 parts of the store's floor were sticky.
29678 many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on.
29679 selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye.
29680 the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back.
29681 never, ever again.
29682 Please know that this place is WORTH the long wait.
29683 I come to Phoenix once a month for work and I make sure I have dinner here.
29684 There is NOT one thing I can complain about.
29685 Remember, good things come to those who wait.
29686 I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine.
29687 The bartenders are very friendly.
29688 The main restaurant will call the house when your table/bar seat is ready.
29689 The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven.
29690 Real firewood is used, not like California Pizza Kitchen's gas oven.
29691 The owner himself makes the pizza.
29692 Every employee is genuinely nice.
29693 With each bite, you have a subtle taste of smoke (not overwhelming).
29694 The crust is thin and crispy...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can fold the slice - for all you NJ/NY natives!
29695 My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more.
29696 I am going to Phoenix this Thursday...guess where I'll be?
29697 PS-Guys, phenomenal eye candy.
29698 You know, for a goodwill this one really isn't bad!
29699 They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see.
29700 I love the books - a great selection of books you have always meant to read (and I don't mean the old classics, though they have those too) like James Patterson, Anne Rice, and all those gooey Twilight books.
29701 Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently, but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon.
29702 Lots of knick-knacks and vases, and about 25 printers to choose from!
29703 Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items - they is a good chance you will find it!
29704 I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great!
29705 I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!
29706 There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening!
29707 I will not be going back!
29708 As far as sports bars go, this one can't be beat.
29709 You won't find one in the East Valley with better food, beer selection, happy hour, or a friendlier staff.
29710 This is hands-down one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas.
29711 I've been here bunches of times, and the only one bad experience I had (overcooked burger) they took care of the situation above and beyond.
29712 I can't say it enough: go, eat, drink, see for yourself: Public House is the best around.
29713 This place is the white-trash Chipotle.
29714 The food is mediocre at best.
29715 I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea!
29716 There's no creativity there.
29717 The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all.
29718 Seriously?
29719 I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!
29720 At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food.
29721 Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is.
29722 Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up.
29723 The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken.
29724 The Fajita veggie were the same.
29725 The product looked of very low quality.
29726 Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce.
29727 The meat looked unappetizing as well.
29728 Just not at the level of Chipotle.
29729 Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me.
29730 I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better.
29731 So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good.
29732 I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe!
29733 Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles!
29734 This place has the worst "Mexican" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell.
29735 Just disgusting food.
29736 I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors.
29737 They are AMAZING!
29738 I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute!
29739 Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc).
29740 Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented.
29741 I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly.
29742 Also, she has a talent for men's hair as well.
29743 She cuts my husband's hair and that is one of his best qualities (I'd say!).
29744 There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men!
29745 Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry.
29746 I never loved my color until I found Veronica.
29747 Now, I trust her completely and know she'll make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me.
29748 She's also super sweet!
29749 I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist.
29750 Love this place!
29751 Wish we had one here in CA.
29752 Great vibe once you walk through that door.
29753 Fantastic drinks and goodies!
29754 !
29755 Price reflects quality and service.
29756 5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.
29757 Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.
29758 The folks here are the best!
29759 After unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking "Sundrops" nail salon with my two year old in tow, I was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled Andy's Nails.
29760 I Yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so I walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces I've seen in a while.
29761 Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter, they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless, one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes!
29762 Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other Arcadia/Biltmore/Camelback Corridor nail salons AND they're cheaper by anywhere from $5-$20!
29763 I'm definitely going back and going back soon!
29764 My toes are lonely...
29765 Ever eat at a Steak 'n Shake?
29766 That's what Freddy's is: a Steak 'N Shake kind of burger and it's delicious!
29767 I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt.
29768 Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the "call" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.
29769 {See my review of "The Habit": their manager never greets customers, can't solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}
29770 Freddy's Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!
29771 Great burger.
29772 Next time I'll get the frozen custard.
29773 I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!
29774 Romantic, quaint, amazing!
29775 We were referred here by a couple of long time Phoenix locals, and we were so happy we took their advice.
29776 We ordered a white pizza, a anti-pasta appetizer, and bottle of Chianti.
29777 We were able to get a table outside and loved the atmosphere!
29778 Perfect date spot...
29779 Another vacation that started and ended with US Airways.
29780 We arrived/departed on time both ways.
29781 My normal sized butt still fits in seats so no issue there.
29782 I enjoyed my free drink and chitchat with the flight attendants.
29783 Brought my own snacks and read a book.
29784 All in all a good beginning/end to a relaxing vacay with the man friend.
29785 First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate.
29786 Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus.
29787 Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks.
29788 At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service.
29789 Black, white, purple,orange.
29790 They just sucked.
29791 I love this place!
29792 People are very friendly and very clean restaurant.
29793 I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis.
29794 I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries, so delicious!
29795 The salads are huge and tasty as well.
29796 The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries.
29797 I can eat here everyday!
29798 Awesome.
29799 So much better than parking on site.
29800 Safe and good prices keep me coming back.
29801 Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation!
29802 Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day.
29803 My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp.
29804 We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.
29805 When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.
29806 However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.
29807 Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant.
29808 They had wonderful mood lighting!
29809 I love low mood lighting!
29810 Our server was very friendly and helpful.
29811 Our meals were excellent.
29812 My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.
29813 We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!
29814 I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!
29815 My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.
29816 I really loved it and I love steak.
29817 Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!
29818 My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.
29819 Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!
29820 It was tasty.
29821 My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.
29822 Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!
29823 The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!!
29824 Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!
29825 Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - "You buy a peaceful experience".
29826 I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could.
29827 This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained.
29828 Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service.
29829 I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated.
29830 This place is great!
29831 A coworker and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and was blown away by both the food and staff.
29832 You get a large bowl from the cashier and can personally stuff whatever meat, veggies and garnish you want.
29833 Then, mix a neat selection of sauces.
29834 Finally, watch the entertaining chefs cook your meal on a large heated stone.
29835 Everything comes out fresh, hot and delicious!
29836 Want a tip?
29837 Use the wax paper next to the chicken to "stuff" your bowl.
29838 Everything will shrink when cooked and this will allow you to have a bigger meal for the same price.
29839 Great food and drink.
29840 The traditional margaritas are the best.
29841 Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining.
29842 The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever.
29843 I love this location, and I love this product.
29844 I think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of product you are getting.
29845 If you've only been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and hate it, give this one a try.
29846 It's got a much better vibe and is a lot less packed.
29847 Walked right in was helped, she grabbed what I needed and I was off.
29848 It took all of 15 minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before.
29849 This place is as good as I'd heard.
29850 We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.
29851 She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.
29852 Both were so delicious!
29853 He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.
29854 The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.
29855 I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place.
29856 The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.
29857  I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.
29858 On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!

29860 Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.
29861 It's epic.
29862 Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.
29863 Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.
29864 I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning.
29865 The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.
29866 Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....
29867 Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.
29868 I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.
29869 I literally googled "dentists for anxious patients", and her name popped up.
29870 Her website appeared too good to be true.
29871 They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.
29872 I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.
29873 They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.
29874 During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.
29875 How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!
29876 They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.
29877 Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.
29878 I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.
29879 Now here's my favorite part.
29880 As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What??
29881 So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).
29882 I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.
29883 And we were off!
29884 She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!
29885 I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!
29886 I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.
29887 I highly recommend this office to anyone!
29888 Stinkweeds shaped my formative years.
29889 Really.
29890 I started shopping at the (now gone) Tempe location when I was 15.
29891 I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store.
29892 I begged my parents for rides and, when that wasn't happening, hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek.
29893 Totally worth it.
29894 100%.
29895 I can't tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting.
29896 If I needed something specifically, Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didn't already have it in stock.
29897 The staff was always welcoming and helpful, sometimes offering their own suggestions.
29898 But it's just a record store, right?
29899 Wrong.
29900 Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix, as far as I am concerned.
29901 Now that it's out in central Phoenix, I make it in far less.
29902 Total bummer!
29903 Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!
29904 The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.
29905 (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!)
29906 After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.
29907 (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)
29908 My roommate and I went on July 2.
29909 They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!
29910 We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.
29911 $18/lb.
29912 The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices.
29913 I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!
29914 Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!
29915 These were GORGEOUS!
29916 Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).
29917 Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.
29918 Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.
29919 The selection was quite impressive, though!
29920 Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!
29921 (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)
29922 Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.
29923 Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.
29924 Nice selection of unique beer and wines.
29925 Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts!
29926 Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.
29927 Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.
29928 OMG amazing meat!
29929 Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!
29930 The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.
29931 (And I adore spicy!)
29932 It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.
29933 The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!
29934 They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!
29935 Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!
29936 (I didn't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)
29937 How could you write a bad review about a mountain?
29938 Great sight to see.
29939 Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday.
29940 After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.
29941 I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.
29942 Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.
29943 I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.
29944 First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.
29945 Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?
29946 The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.
29947 Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.
29948 "What's good?"
29949 He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.
29950 Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.
29951 With drink, under $9.
29952 A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.
29953 The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).
29954 The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.
29955 The sauce was also very good.
29956 The pita?
29957 Warm, soft and tasty.
29958 The fries?
29959 Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.
29960 I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.
29961 Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.
29962 Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.
29963 I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors...
29964 YOWZA!
29965 I love this place.
29966 I had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year.
29967 I decided to take my mom and try it out for lunch.
29968 The food was pretty good, but the best thing for me is that they have Cerignola olives!
29969 This was music to my ears when they told me they had them.
29970 I have been looking everywhere, checking every grocery store, gourmet shop in Chandler and Tucson and nobody has them.
29971 I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu!
29972 Oh and expect a little off roading, the parking lot is loose gravel :)
29973 Let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who I had to take in.
29974 I am dog sitting my friend's dog.
29975 They are on vacation.
29976 Dr. Alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable.
29977 I called at 5:15.
29978 They got me in at 5:30.
29979 Dr. Alber spent 40 minutes with me.
29980 Explained everything to me thoroughly.
29981 Little Rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable.
29982 Dr. Alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it.
29983 EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE.
29984 $70 out the door, RX in hand and a tube of eye drops.
29985 I am in awe.
29986 I will recommend this clinic to everyone I know.
29987 I just cannot say enough good things about these lovely people.
29988 THANK YOU PRESTIGE ANIMAL CLINIC.
29989 YOU ROCK!!!!!!!
29990 I will now be taking my own little guy there.
29991 You guys are now the only vet I will ever use.
29992 Where I had the most delicious thing I ever put in my mouth.
29993 This is a favorite of me and my friends, especially for sunday morning brunch.
29994 I would say we go at least one time a week.
29995 Their Quiche (especially the Goat cheese, caramelized onions, and wallnuts) is the best you will ever have and their salad dressing (which is made in house) is equally delicious.
29996 The most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my whole life was actually a rose macaroon.
29997 I have never had an emotional reaction to a food item before but I swear I almost cried and had flashbacks of my childhood being at the botanical gardens.
29998 Any way, if you haven't been here you HAVE to go.
29999 Its one of Arizona's few authentic cultural treasures.
30000 Gosh Darn It!
30001 They had to be good.
30002 I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that they'd be horrible.
30003 Then I'd never have to go again...
30004 But, alas...too good to not go back, that's for sure!
30005 I've said it before, I'll say it again: if you don't like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you don't want.
30006 Heck, if you're sitting next to me and my kids, they'll eat it for you!
30007 !
30008 I didn't think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING!
30009 Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs!
30010 Yum.
30011 Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY).
30012 The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet.
30013 It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle.
30014 Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes!
30015 I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later.
30016 Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety.
30017 This place is an experience.
30018 I can't stop thinking about it!!!
30019 I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)
30020 and everything tastes so fresh and organic.
30021 It's nice to have something like this close by our house!
30022 A true guilty pleasure.
30023 Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon!
30024 Never had anything like that in Sweden!
30025 Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience.
30026 They have a comedy show twice a month.
30027 Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!
30028 Very nice location but food was awful.
30029 Had a chicken salad yuck.
30030 Service stunk big time!
30031 This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the Tempe/Mesa area, or already know people who live there.
30032 I say it's convenient-- if you are flying in from Grand Island or Grand Forks or Rapid City or East Bugtussel, since the only commercial tenant at this decomissioned air force base is Allegiant Airlines, which specializes in flying you from nowhere to somewhere (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Orlando that sort of thing).
30033 But from landing to sitting in my rental car it was maybe 20 minutes tops and I was heading out to lunch in the Phoenix area (don't bother with purchasing the "snacks" on the flight, just make sure you are prepared beforehand).
30034 I just have to tell you that this place is amazing.
30035 Not only is the food top notch so is the service.
30036 It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one.
30037 The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic.
30038 I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing.
30039 I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service.
30040 I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day.
30041 If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay.
30042 We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough.
30043 We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat.
30044 Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!
30045 !
30046 I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.
30047 The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.
30048 The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.
30049 The miso soup was served barely like warm.
30050 The tea was served barely luke warm.
30051 That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.
30052 Tea refills?
30053 Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.
30054 The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.
30055 Basically no redeeming features here.
30056 I went here for my birthday this year.
30057 The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic.
30058 When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice.
30059 The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.
30060 Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy.
30061 Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual.
30062 I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience.
30063 Their donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community.
30064 Such great people at this location especially.
30065 I Love Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and you will too!
30066 Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's.
30067 I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations.
30068 When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food.
30069 The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent "Forget about it".
30070 But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try.
30071 The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid.
30072 Yes I said Kool Aid.
30073 I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID.
30074 Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968.
30075 This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it.
30076 This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly.
30077 When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie.
30078 He did the song "Just a Friend" back in 1990.
30079 The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like.
30080 BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE.
30081 TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT
30082 Love Belly Rubz!!
30083 At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didn't want to quit playing!
30084 He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels, so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer.
30085 He loved playing and came out looking so handsome!
30086 We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming!
30087 Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.
30088 Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron.
30089 It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early.
30090 We finished our last call drinks and started to head out.
30091 The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom.
30092 At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave.
30093 My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off.
30094 I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out.
30095 As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him.
30096 The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him.
30097 At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him.
30098 I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force.
30099 We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request.
30100 He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground.
30101 Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive.
30102 The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.
30103  I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again.
30104 We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment.
30105 Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves.
30106 What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of.
30107 These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.
30108 Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm.
30109 Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain.
30110 Very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm.
30111 Orange juice was fresh and tasty.
30112 Eggs and bacon were very good.
30113 Biscuits and gravy were excellent.
30114 The setting was the star of this breakfast!
30115 I would recommend !
30116 You won't be sorry !
30117 We ate here to celebrate our engagement during a weekend getaway to AZ.
30118 My fiance had coordinated with the restaurant beforehand to have rose petals and 2 glasses of champagne set for us before we arrived.
30119 The rose petals were fresh and a mix of red, yellow, and pink... beautiful colors!
30120 I ordered one of their fish dishes that came is a REALLY hot skillet, and I accidently burned my hand on the skillet.
30121 We saw one of the employees walking by, so we asked if he had anything for the burn, and he ran off looking for burn spray and bandaids.
30122 He was back in no time with everything I needed to treat the burn - amazing service!
30123 I THINK his name was Nick, but I can't remember.
30124 Good job, T Cooks!
30125 i've never had a problem getting assistance here, except when it's busy, usually on a sat/sun.
30126 it's not that far from the house, maybe a mile, so i if i'm in a real bind, i come on by here to pick up some stuff.
30127 they've offered groupons here and with those, i've bought some power tools and hardware.
30128 ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good!
30129 This place used to be amazing.
30130 My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.
30131 It's not the same anymore.
30132 We went for my wife's 30th birthday.
30133 My dad decided to join us.
30134 My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.
30135 I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.
30136 I was craving it.
30137 We got our appetizer's.
30138 Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.
30139 My dad was happy with the snails.
30140 But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?
30141 The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.
30142 It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.
30143 I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.
30144 The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.
30145 It looked dry and over cooked.
30146 I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.
30147 He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.
30148 I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.
30149 Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.
30150 While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.
30151 They just shook their head and told me not to.
30152 I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.
30153 How do you screw up steak this bad?
30154 It tasted like beef jerky and butter.
30155 My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.
30156 I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.
30157 How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?
30158 Fortunately, that came out fine.
30159 So we left hungry and $300 poorer.
30160 I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.
30161 I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.
30162 Fantastic meal.
30163 Fantastic experience.
30164 I am a vegetarian.
30165 I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation, starting with sourcing.
30166 I don't just patronize Farmers Markets, I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Markets....that sort of thing.
30167 Long story short, if I am going to dine out, I want something very special.
30168 VERY special.
30169 Quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn.
30170 I dined there with my son and daughter-in-law...both truly expert cooks...more knowledgeable than I.
30171 All of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal.
30172 We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine.
30173 I got the vegetarian...they got the carnivore (or ominvore or whatever they call it!).
30174 Truthfully, labels are irrelevant.
30175 It's all in the taste...and the tastes are sublime!
30176 I was impressed by how much variety was in each plate.
30177 Theirs were similar but each a little different.
30178 More importantly, there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors.
30179 The most impressive thing:   The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations .
30180 That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable.
30181 The setting is beautiful.
30182 The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well.
30183 Our only criticism (and it is minor)  is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted, we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability.
30184 There is so much wonderful local fruit (used in other courses, I might add!
30185 )...perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely...I'm sure the chefs' creativity can conjure more ideas than I!
30186 That said, I will return!
30187 As often as possible!
30188 Quiessence and the Farm at South Mountain are an unparalleled resource for the Phoenix community...easy to get to from any part of the Valley...no excuses, folks!...Go!
30189 what can I say - we're CF regulars...just love the place.
30190 I guess we are lucky because we have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes for 3 of us.
30191 We eat here at least twice a month and we always start with the avocado egg rolls - they are to die for and the dipping sauce is yummy!
30192 I usually get a Glam burger - the only time I eat red meat -  and so far have not had one I did not like.
30193 I  often take 1/2 home so I can save room for some cheesecake, an absolute must when at CF.
30194 We have never had a bad cheesecake and try a different one each time.
30195 This is the only hamburger that I have liked the next day - usually hamburger is the one food that is not a good take home food as it just does not taste good as a left over - but I have actually eaten it cold because I took a bite before heating it and just kept going...yes, weird I know.
30196 If nothing else, go there for some avocado egg rolls and then treat yourself to a cheesecake....I'm totally addicted!
30197 Absolute divine decadence!
30198 ;D
30199 Had some amazing cuisine at Milagro's.
30200 The chef is truly an innovative genius.
30201 Our food was so unique and delicious.
30202 Plus, the weather was so nice that we sat out on their beautiful patio and watched the sunset on the purple mountains.
30203 I highly recommend the PB & J appetizer.
30204 It's nothing you have ever had before I can assure you.
30205 I would also highly recommend the swordfish dish and tacos.
30206 Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight, I guess that's not the thing to do here.
30207 Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.
30208 After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.
30209 The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.
30210 40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.
30211 I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.
30212 Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.
30213 Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.
30214 5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.
30215 Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.
30216 I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.
30217 We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.
30218 I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.
30219 None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.
30220 I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.
30221 Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.
30222 So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision.
30223 Great time, great location, ability to park in garage behind it.
30224 Beautiful decor, candles, white furnishings, trimmed in wood.
30225 Excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place.
30226 See if you can spot the dj booth!
30227 He's cool, friendly door staff.
30228 The bartenders kind of ignore you and there's a brunette girl bartender-stay away from her.
30229 Downer attitude, and she will charge you for 2 drinks even though they have a 2 for 1 special.
30230 But it's a cool club and it's 99% certain you'll have great time.
30231 We drove in from LA for spring training.
30232 Had a free evening and the old Pizza Hut remake looked interesting.
30233 To our great surprise, we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time.
30234 Once you get inside, you'll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and you'll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia.
30235 Good food, good service...and the price is great.
30236 I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew (spelled differently).
30237 Was going to go again, but they close on Sundays...boo.
30238 Don't know if it's consistently this good, but for our one night in Phoenix, we were pleasantly surprised.
30239 Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food.
30240 You don't necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chili-adverse people like me but it's there for those that need the heat.
30241 The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine, but the flavors are unique and delicious...and definitely NOT Chinese.
30242 The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dish...it's a meal in itself.
30243 Try this place and you won't be disappointed.
30244 Beef gyros are always good here.
30245 My daughter and I really enjoy eating here.
30246 We tend to order the same thing every time because it's so good.
30247 She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad.
30248 They both rock.
30249 It's cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay, then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you.
30250 The food is always very fresh and delicious.
30251 And by the time we're out of there, it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond.
30252 Highly recommended.
30253 Found the Tuck Shop on my Urban Spoon AP and what a grand surprise it ended up being!
30254 In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel!
30255 The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.
30256 The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.
30257 The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.
30258 The broccoli was a great fresh touch.
30259 The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.
30260 A must try if you are a down town kinda person!
30261 The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.
30262 The menu changes with the season so go check it out!
30263 Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.
30264 For a sub shop, great place.
30265 Delivery is freaky fast for sure.
30266 I order delivery half the time.
30267 Pro's
30268 - fast delivery
30269 - quick service if ordering onsite
30270 - staff friendly
30271 - food is good
30272 Con's
30273 - No WiFi.
30274 Would like since AT&T service spotty near this building.
30275 Good spot.
30276 Glad there is a location here.
30277 Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people, or once they got through the "soft opening"  they gave up, because this place was not good.
30278 The service was mediocre at best, they seemed scattered and unfocused, took five minutes to get water.
30279 I gave up on ordering anything else after that.
30280 The food?
30281 Bland hamburger, that was cooked perfectly in the center.
30282 Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry.
30283 Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters.
30284 Let's talk about this "coal oven".
30285 While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven, you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant, they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e.
30286 pan fried!
30287 The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger.
30288 Overall, if I am going to spend $10 on a burger with no sides, it better be perfect, and this wasn't.
30289 I would also hope $5 would get me more than two fritters.
30290 Dining at Roaring Fork was enjoyable.
30291 The decor is warm and cozy, with an upscale vibe.
30292 Our large group was accommodated for on the patio, and since it was happy hour, we were quite a demanding bunch.
30293 The service was a little slow, but all drinks and food came out perfectly.
30294 I had trouble deciding what to order because everything looked so good!
30295 I split the Big Ass Burger (a huge ground chuck patty with cheddar cheese, peppered bacon, thick-cut tomatoes, pickles, and onions) and a kettle of fries with a couple friends.
30296 I also had the mixed greens salad (field greens with candied walnuts and feta, with some sort of vinegarette).
30297 The ahi tuna looked really good, as did the fish tacos.
30298 I also heard raves about the green pork chili.
30299 So many amazing options & a great atmosphere--I'll definitely be back soon!
30300 !
30301 Amazing food.
30302 Great date night place with an impressive wine list.
30303 Definitely come her again and more often.
30304 NEW LOCATION FOR 2012:
30305 Portland Parkway in Downtown Phoenix, Portland St. & Central Ave, right across from the Roosevelt Light Rail Station!
30306 Saturday, November 12, 10am-4pm
30307 Find more info here: http://www.localfirstaz.com/fall-festival/
30308 Bigger location = more fun!
30309 I am a huge fan of this restaurant.
30310 I love their locally grown fruits and veggies.
30311 I love their healthy options.
30312 I had their brown rice with curry sauce, veggies, and organic chicken...it was incredible!
30313 Can't wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant!
30314 PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA!
30315 It would be a hit!
30316 My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago.
30317 At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn't do too well with other girls.
30318 She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop (her first choice) to ballet, jazz, and lyrical.
30319 I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer.
30320 Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.
30321 My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.
30322 Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.
30323 I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.
30324 I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.
30325 My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.
30326 I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family.
30327 Ugh.
30328 My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.
30329 But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.
30330 I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.
30331 They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.
30332 Price was reasonable.
30333 Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.
30334 Food was inedible.
30335 I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.
30336 I couldn't eat any of it.
30337 The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.
30338 I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.
30339 I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).
30340 The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.
30341 The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.
30342 I watch too many movies.
30343 The egg roll was just gross.
30344 It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.
30345 The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.
30346 I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express.
30347 Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle.
30348 First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter.
30349 I am not comfortable doing that anywhere.
30350 Who does that?
30351 The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore.
30352 Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!!
30353 I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!)
30354 Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes.
30355 If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning???
30356 IN ARIZONA??
30357 Madness!
30358 Here's a thought, don't post on the door to your restaraunt "Up scale Mexican Food" unless you can prove it.
30359 This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.
30360 Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.
30361 Will not return.
30362 Great service, great food, highly recommend.
30363 We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.
30364 Will definitely go back and recommend to friends.
30365 The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.
30366 What are you craving at the moment?
30367 Perhaps a cup of coffee?
30368 a scoop of gelato?
30369 an empanada?
30370 gourmet pastry?
30371 homemade tomato soup?
30372 perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote?
30373 red wine?
30374 magazine?
30375 fresh fruit?
30376 Diet Coke?
30377 Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!
30378 In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.
30379 After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!
30380 I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.
30381 Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma.
30382 We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group.
30383 We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night.
30384 I must say the place was pretty hoppin' for an early week night.
30385 We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak.
30386 It was so good we didn't even speak to each other through the entire sitting.
30387 It was the kind of meal you don't mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness.
30388 Gross, I know, but you know what I'm talking about!
30389 The server we had was as good as a ghost.
30390 We never wanted for anything but he left us alone.
30391 I wasn't super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn't had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before.
30392 I'd kinda like to shave off like a 1/4 of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons.
30393 They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing.
30394 The people at this title company are as good as it gets.
30395 They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that use
30396 them.
30397 Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regarding
30398 the Social Media techniques and readily share their expertise
30399 and time to teach the skills of Twitter, Facebook, Hootsuite, and
30400 other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner.
30401 The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished.
30402 prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience.
30403 the food is divine.
30404 the service is laid back (in a good way).
30405 the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats.
30406 the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs.
30407 probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong, you will be stuck for a while.
30408 perfect spot for an anniversary or something.
30409 or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about.
30410 Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!!
30411 Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is!
30412 They do all sorts of combinations and toppings.
30413 Mmmm mmmm good.
30414 The hero sandwiches and wings are good too.
30415 Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies.
30416 And they deliver, too.
30417 Much better quality than chain pizzerias.
30418 If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour.
30419 I have only ever ordered the Oggie (I'm a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesn't disappoint.
30420 Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.
30421 It's also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table.
30422 You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!
30423 I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!
30424 The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center.
30425 Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food!
30426 I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortilla's burrito style.
30427 It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65).
30428 The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky.
30429 Maybe this is a better place for pickup.
30430 If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner.
30431 I'll be back!
30432 Laura certainly doesn't need my review for help, but all of these people are correct.
30433 She is meticulous, easy to be around and takes joy in her work.
30434 When I read all of the 5 star reviews, I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy.
30435 I found her via Yelp.... and loved her!
30436 $20 eyebrow wax, takes credit cards.
30437 Awesome Mexican food, fast service at drive in or sit in and eat...try the new fish tacos, they're great, and authentic, too.
30438 I only ask for two things when I'm flying.
30439 To land safely.
30440 And to not fear planes while on them.
30441 US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one.
30442 Took a flight late from PHX to SFO.
30443 Two hours isn't too bad.
30444 Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives.
30445 I understand that turbulence is normal.
30446 But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.
30447 Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying "Wow, that was scary.
30448 I'm surprised we landed alright."
30449 Morons.
30450 They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life.
30451 This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food.
30452 The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers.
30453 Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?
30454 My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein.
30455 You will not be disappointed.
30456 You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so.
30457 You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people.
30458 She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table.
30459 Give the hot and sour soup a try.
30460 As for the service, it depends on how you look at it.
30461 Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water.
30462 Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already.
30463 She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop.
30464 So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want.
30465 She doesn't have a problem with it.
30466 Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff.
30467 It's not dirty, just broke down.
30468 You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers.
30469 Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.
30470 The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap.
30471 Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya.
30472 So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off.
30473 They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though.
30474 You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.
30475 Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called "Salty Fish".
30476 It stinks to all heck!
30477 If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home.
30478 I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.
30479 Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place.
30480 That means the food is pretty authentic!
30481 Two other AC companies were going to charge me double for the same fix.
30482 Accutemp has a new customer for life!
30483 Highly recommend!
30484 If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service, Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go.
30485 They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years, since the first day she opened her doors.
30486 I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area.
30487 Her loving warmth (sort of Doris Day way) makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often.
30488 She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty high-rise and offers excellent grooming.
30489 She is worth the trip.
30490 "MMMM.
30491 THIS IS.
30492 A TASTY BURGER."
30493 - Jules.
30494 Pulp Fiction.
30495 I like this place, my siblings like this place, and it's the best thing I've got to remembering better times back home in California.
30496 It's a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price.
30497 It always hits the spot when I'm feeling like a fatty.
30498 :)
30499 Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through.
30500 (Coz the cool kids did it back then...
30501 In CA anyway haha.
30502 And employees didn't care.)
30503 I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon (after school).
30504 Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS, ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to-go orders.
30505 Biiiiiiiiiiig plus!
30506 Fresh.
30507 Tasty.
30508 Interesting.
30509 Good "People Watching."
30510 Love everything I have tried here.
30511 The Happy Hour "tapas" are excellent.
30512 My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one.
30513 The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like "meatless chili" but you don't miss the meat.
30514 The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch.
30515 Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing.
30516 Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes.
30517 I go eat there as often as is reasonable.
30518 Highly Recommended.
30519 I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here.
30520 I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here.
30521 I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want.
30522 We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger.
30523 The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA.
30524 About 20 minutes later the food comes out.
30525 The patty looks right.
30526 I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it.
30527 It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right.
30528 (2nd mistake)
30529 I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table.
30530 It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there.
30531 So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution.
30532 I immediately start to freak out.
30533 We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey?
30534 She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey.
30535 I say, no that doesn't sound right.
30536 So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again.
30537 The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened.
30538 I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey?
30539 I mean, really.
30540 I know some people might think how did I not know the difference.
30541 And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have.
30542 And it hurts me every time I think about it.
30543 I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience.
30544 All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat.
30545 Stress that to them.
30546 Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.
30547 Quality sushi, fun ambiance, and the chefs there are a blast to talk with.
30548 Definitely worth a visit.
30549 Best customer service you can find!
30550 I buy all of my reptiles and feeders from these guys!James the owner is awesome and very eager to answer any and all questions you have.he will even probe your snakes for free!Every animal i have bought from them has been in tip top shape!Their prices are great and the employees are awesome!I suggest them over any and all shops in the east valley including az reptile center and predators.Give em a shot you will be glad you did!
30551 Fantastic restaurant.
30552 Service was great.
30553 Food was excellent.
30554 Their happy hour from 3-7 is great.
30555 3.00 entree's.
30556 Everything from a 1/2 pound burger to margherita flat bread pizza is just 3.00.
30557 Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce.
30558 Don't know where I should start.
30559 Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010.
30560 We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.
30561 When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular "Chinese" restaurant.
30562 So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall.
30563 It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.
30564 Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name.
30565 So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things.
30566 Totally not efficient at all.
30567 Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.
30568 Our "Har Gow"/Shrimp dumpling was raw!
30569 The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked.
30570 We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw.
30571 We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw.
30572 Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food.
30573 Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food?
30574 That was probably the lamest excuse.
30575 The trademark "beef internal organs" that I always love to order was pathetic.
30576 They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon.
30577 The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either.
30578 There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.
30579 I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion.
30580 They even offer wedding banquets here too.
30581 I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food.
30582 The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.
30583 If you have never been before you should really try harder...
30584 Your mother taught you better than that.
30585 Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta.
30586 We ordered.
30587 I had to return my chicken tenders.
30588 Undr cooked and rubbery.
30589 My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.
30590 what a horrible experience.
30591 We have been huge fans and now this?
30592 I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.
30593 Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.
30594 We will never return!
30595 !
30596 Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.
30597 *** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.
30598 *** And DO NOT CARE!
30599 I absolutely LOVE Club SAR!
30600 I joined back in 2010 (I think...).
30601 At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).
30602 Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-(
30603 But, at least I could still learn and get fit.
30604 :-)
30605 We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed.
30606 So, we left.
30607 I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy.
30608 Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was!
30609 I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SAR's boxing classes, I was hooked!
30610 For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had.
30611 I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA...
30612 Yes!
30613 MMA too, which I personally love.
30614 :-) ).
30615 Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom.
30616 They're funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes.
30617 The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley.
30618 Fees
30619 YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident
30620 Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150
30621 Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75
30622 Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents
30623 If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the "posing" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like "meeting places" and "meat markets" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you!
30624 Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape.
30625 :-)
30626 They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several "Bob bags", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas.
30627 Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other "kickboxing/Yoga room.
30628 And, in case you didn't notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring.
30629 Yes.
30630 I am totally endorsing this gym!
30631 P.S.
30632 This is a "no frills", serious gym.
30633 So, no whinnying and crying.
30634 Suck it up and do some push-ups!
30635 ;-)
30636 Call them for more details:

30638 I had an awesome experience here and highly recommend Dr. Dachs.
30639 He is here to be a good dentist, not just to get rich.
30640 His hygienist was a rock star: So nice and very gentle.
30641 I nearly fell asleep during the cleaning.
30642 I found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away (see my review of Belmont Dentistry on Raintree).
30643 Dr. Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism.
30644 I am very thankful that my "second opinion" quest led me to him.
30645 I now finally have a top-quality dentist in Scottsdale I can trust!
30646 I definitely recommend selecting this practice.
30647 It may take a little time to get in, but it's worth it.
30648 They also work well with insurance.
30649 Woohoo is right.
30650 My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves.
30651 Last night was the best so far.
30652 We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special.
30653 It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave.
30654 Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the " burnt" one and already had another one cooking.
30655 I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from.
30656 The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art.
30657 My husband's pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was.
30658 I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here.
30659 Special service too!
30660 thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina ( sorry there isn't a better word,is there?)
30661 Linda and Ron
30662 Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from.
30663 Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all!
30664 But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to "go for broke", as it were and if we couldn't finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu.
30665  For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad.
30666 These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly.
30667 The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that "generic clump of lettuce" flavor I hate.
30668  From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan.
30669 My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece.
30670 It's true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served.
30671 The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasn't expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much.
30672  At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ.
30673 These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer.
30674 Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell.
30675  At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod.
30676 The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored.
30677 It was an effort to be share fairly.
30678 I believe my date said after our first taste of it, "Just eat what you want and I'll finish ...",  I looked up from my chopsticks, "... you know what?
30679 Just cut me off half."
30680  I wasn't sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldn't be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right?
30681 So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal.
30682 Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it.
30683  Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds.
30684 In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple.
30685 I didn't like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you're not paying attention.
30686 Smooth.
30687  That's it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away.
30688 There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness.
30689 The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying.
30690  What am I supposed to do with this?
30691 Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what?
30692 It flummoxed me.
30693 I love this place.
30694 My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale.
30695 Pro's
30696 quick and easy.
30697 good service.
30698 clean.
30699 good food.
30700 good management.
30701 not too expensive.
30702 they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable).
30703 cons,
30704 the salad dressing is quite sharp.
30705 This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe.
30706 The food is great with many vegetarian options.
30707 The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet and the servers are all nice.
30708 Highly recommended
30709 This place is everything a sports bar should be.
30710 Lots and lots of TV's...for one.
30711 I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time.
30712 The drink specials are pretty decent.
30713 They're not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour.
30714 The food is great!
30715 So far I've only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips.
30716 All of them were seriously delicious!
30717 These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but I've definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places.
30718 These certainly surpassed my expectations.
30719 And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie.
30720 One of the best bartenders I've ever seen.
30721 She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks.
30722 And by great, I mean a good stiff drink that's not so strong that you can't taste anything else in it.
30723 We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason.
30724 Do yourself a favor and stop in!
30725 Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special.
30726 I am being generous with my review.
30727 I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years.
30728 I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style.
30729 I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know).
30730 This place was more than accommodating.
30731 The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time.
30732 I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed.
30733 I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto.
30734 Both were fantastic entrees.
30735 To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu.
30736 There is nothing bad I can say for this place.
30737 The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant.
30738 I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar.
30739 That is just good thinking.
30740 It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale.
30741 I am in love...
30742 I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley.
30743 I am VERY picky and I rate most Chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their won-ton soup and the colour of their fried rice.
30744 Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test ( yup people, some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow "Spanish Rice" in a Chinese restaurant), I was able to look into the quality of their other food items.
30745 When you can deliver Mei Fun Singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue, I feel you deserve that illusive fifth star.
30746 Service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items.
30747 I also note that they offered iced Thai tea with cream.
30748 My buddy got a plate of broccoli, tofu, and a wonderful  Kun Pao sauce.
30749 Sorry, but I think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we.
30750 Hmmmm.
30751 I am getting hungry.
30752 I think  I will go  there now.
30753 Wonder if I should get their pepper steak.
30754 So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great.
30755 We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic.
30756 So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very "Spicolli-like" voice, "uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight".....
30757 So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards...
30758 The guy replies, "dude, you're outta luck"....
30759 Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good...
30760 I wont be going back in there...
30761 So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town.
30762 Hiro was just what the doctor ordered.
30763 We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away.
30764 We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint.
30765 He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night....
30766 When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it.....
30767 I'm sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!
30768 Morale of the story is that Yasu's children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!
30769 Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx.
30770 Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience.
30771 Definitely go soon!
30772 This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.
30773 I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.
30774 Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.
30775 Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck.
30776 Thats what makes this Subway so great.
30777 Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.
30778 Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately.
30779 Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store...but thats just what it is get over it!
30780 The food however is fantastic!
30781 I ordered the samosa chaat...A samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney.
30782 A delicious Punjabi snack!
30783 The portion was very generous and the price cheap.
30784 I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party.
30785 Very convenient and good service.
30786 I will be a regular from now on!
30787 As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch.
30788 At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio.
30789 Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted.
30790 A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty?
30791 My mouth waters just thinking about it.
30792 Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest).
30793 When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!
30794 I was referred to Jones Family Dentistry for an emergency procedure.
30795 I cannot express how incredible the staff and doctors were.
30796 I appreciate all the time and help they gave me.
30797 The follow up phone call really showed how caring they are.
30798 AMAZING Dentists!!!
30799 My family has a new dentist.
30800 Thank you!!
30801 !
30802 Being from San Antonio I missed Rudy's so much!
30803 This Arizona location is similar, but different.
30804 The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible!
30805 Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers!
30806 I will still keep coming for the brisket when I'm in the area!!!!
30807 !
30808 Sunridge Canyon has been one of my very favorite courses since I first played it 6+ years ago.
30809 I have to admit I did work here for a two-year span several years ago, but it was one of my favorites before, during, and since then.
30810 It's not as hyped as Grayhawk, Troon, and some other courses but it's just as great of a layout, if not better than some of the more popular high-end courses in the valley (definitely better than the overrated Grayhawk).
30811 The course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time.
30812 You'll be toast if you don't hit it fairly straight on most holes, but you won't be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blind-shot-heavy courses (i.e.
30813 We-Ko-Pa) here in the valley.
30814 I've shot in the 70s one day and in the 90s the next out there.
30815 Besides the superb and scenic layout, I also like the simplicity of the overall complex.
30816 It's not at a big resort, there aren't multiple courses, and there is no grand clubhouse (not that all those things are always bad).
30817 It's just the 18 holes, pro shop, and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food.
30818 The staff is friendly and helpful, too.
30819 It's like a neighborhood course albeit a high-end one.
30820 They have some great summer rates for locals this summer: Any day, any time for only $35.
30821 I recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts.
30822 I played yesterday and the course was in good shape tee-to-green, and outstanding shape on the greens.
30823 It's been awhile since I've seen greens roll this well on a $35 course here in town.
30824 One last, but important, note: It gets WINDY out here.
30825 As in, it gets windy every day.
30826 The course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time.
30827 An early morning tee time is best since it gives you your best chance to take on the uphill back-nine without the wind gusting in your face.
30828 Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike.
30829 They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.
30830 Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits.
30831 They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand.
30832 We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering.
30833 The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor.
30834 The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer.
30835 Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.
30836 This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot.
30837 A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food.
30838 Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items.
30839 Although I haven't explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blanco's items don't stray far from excellence.
30840 I love pueblo pediatric also!
30841 And, also surprised there aren't any reviews!
30842 There staff is always friendly and helpful.
30843 Rooms are always clean.
30844  I take my baby to Dr. Salek.
30845 He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel "stupid" for asking.
30846 He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing.
30847 Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered, but Dr. Salek really takes his time.
30848 I went in during a very busy day...flu season actually.
30849 My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in.
30850 They did surprisingly and I saw Dr. Salek.
30851 He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry.
30852 Well as any mom, I was worried and continued with my questions...I was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed.
30853 I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied "we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked".
30854 Now that's what I call service...if only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care!
30855 I haven't seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good!
30856 Also, they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practice...meaning they take pride in what they do!
30857 In a never ending quest to find new lunch spots me and a coworker stumbled upon this place.
30858 Hearing it from another person we were originally looking for somewhere else.
30859 Overall I thought the food was excellent.
30860 A generous portion, and a price you can't beat.
30861 A little difficult to order but got exactly what we wanted.
30862 Only problem I can see is no where to sit.
30863 So you have to take it to go.
30864 Still worth it.
30865 Move over Jacques Torres!
30866 Angela has come to town and just might be the next big thing for Phoenix (and the confectionary world!)
30867 I happened to find this place just on a whim....I was reminiscing the other day about all the wonderful chocolatiers in other big cities, and it occured to me 'maybe there is a chocolatier in Phoenix?'
30868 Sure enough, there is!!
30869 (thanks yelp!)
30870 and she's GOOD!!!
30871 !
30872 Angela is as sweet as her candy is!
30873 She explained how she just started this business in October of last year; she is a self-taught, talented and creative, as authentic as it gets, chocolatier!
30874 She uses all organic ingredients, including fair-trade organic chocolate.
30875 You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose, Mudslide, Strawberry Balsamic, Lavender Lemonade, Madras Curry, Avacado Wasabi, Maple-Smoked Bacon (yeah, I KNOW!
30876 )....and like a million more!
30877 AND the best news of all, is that she says she has perfected a dairy-free recipe for truffles...I.
30878 CAN'T.
30879 WAIT!
30880 I hope I'm the first to order that batch!!
30881 Besides beautiful, flavorful truffles, she makes her own marshmallows (in various amazing flavors as well) Chocolate Bark (which is always dairy-free) and even different hot chocolate mixes.
30882 The most amazing thing of all is....now, get ready for this....all of this magic comes right out of her home kitchen!!
30883 THAT means, everything is made with *love* :)  So, if you happen to yelp this, like I did, the map will actually take you to her business, which is located in her house, in a neighborhood (a little confusing at first....) but it IS LEGIT!
30884 She said normally it's by appointment only (I was not) but she gladly had me in and I got to see some of her gastronomic creations anyways (yay!)
30885 However, she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market (Wednesdays) and the Tempe Farmers Market (on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays) In fact, if you go to her website, you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice... (can't wait to do this!!)
30886 Needless to say, this made my day...no, like, my week!
30887 SO excited to have a real, gourmet chocolatier right in my own neck of the woods!
30888 Woo hoo!
30889 !
30890 Bomb .....................................................................................................................
30891 Heated toilet seats
30892 Just went to this theater last night, and it was great!
30893 Started with friendly staff...every one of them!
30894 (not common these days)  Went to get a popcorn, and the nice girl suggested...."why don't you press your button at your seat and someone will come serve you!
30895 Take advantage of the service!"
30896 We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button, someone came within a few minutes.
30897 There was a full menu at our fingertips...including alcohol and specialty coffees.
30898 Our seats were comfortable, leather (or pleather), roomy, we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us, we had 3 cup holders between the both of us, and the seats leaned back.
30899 Not a bad seat in the theater...we got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computer/pad.
30900 I'm really impressed with the prices, too, because for just $2 more than a regular, cramped, loud, teenager-infested movie theater, we felt like we were getting First Class treatment, all night!
30901 The snack, food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater; but not more than it would be elsewhere.
30902 Pretzel was about $4.50 and Hummus was about $6.50 for example.
30903 I'm sad to read Ruth Ann's review because it sounds like an isolated incident, and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she had...an experience can't be absolutely perfect.
30904 In my case, there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder, but that's not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3!
30905 Go to this theater!
30906 It's really a great night out!
30907 (As long as you like the movie you pick, which we did :)
30908 House special chicken is a must.
30909 This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good!
30910 Never have had to wait for a table.
30911 The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too.
30912 I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection.
30913 Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu.
30914 And a LARGE wait!
30915 Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator.
30916 I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, "What are you doing here?"
30917 If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.
30918 If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here.
30919 The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie.
30920 a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution.
30921 The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.
30922 A few pluses though...
30923 If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing.
30924 I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck.
30925 It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world.
30926 The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.
30927 If you go here you're one of three types of people:
30928 1) You were dragged here by your friends
30929 2) You're under 21
30930 or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, "I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!"
30931 These girls know how to make working out awesome and fun!!!!
30932 Quality instructors, will not disappoint!!!
30933 Lots of variety!!
30934 !
30935 As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give.
30936 Kristi is my go-to massage therapist.
30937 With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts she's got amazing strength and sensitivity.
30938 AND--she's a great listener--it's kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot.
30939 It's the best hour of my week!  "
30940 We made a last minute decision to go out on New Year's Eve.
30941 The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar ( our favorite place to sit) and the bar tenders, Blake, Kennan and Clair were ON IT!
30942 They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.
30943 The food was excellent.
30944 My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato.
30945 Everything was cooked to perfection.
30946 Oh yes!
30947 Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy!
30948 Greatness in the form of food, just like the other locations.
30949 The service was particularly good at this location.
30950 We sat at the bar,and while the other customers were mildly annoying, the late night bartenders were up beat, witty, and very personable.
30951 The atmosphere was par for the course.
30952 All in all, if you are reading this review, get your directions to this location, close the browser, and go eat!
30953 Awesome, delicious lunch or dinner takeout place!
30954 Quite a dive in terms of decor, so don't expect anything fancy.
30955 There are folding tables and chairs, if I remember correctly.
30956 Anyway, I had jade red chicken and emperor's chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD.
30957 The idea of Chinese - Latino food sounds odd, but I'd heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it.
30958 They have all sorts of combos, mostly with beans or rice as a side (get it?
30959 chinese and latin food both usually come with rice....!).
30960 So before you knock it, if you're in Phoenix and looking for a place to eat, this is it!
30961 in addition to sucking, it's also expensive.
30962 I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet!
30963 By far, one of my favorite places to go.
30964 You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price.
30965 I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle.
30966 I also like the corn dog and onion rings.
30967 I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7.
30968 Love it!
30969 Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice.
30970 Great place to go before heading to the zoo.
30971 Not a lot of seating if you're with a big party
30972 These guys know their stuff.
30973 Professional staff and great location.
30974 From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities.
30975 I wish I was one after leaving here!
30976 The food was some of the best Thai we've ever had, and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants.
30977 We never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine.
30978 I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings.
30979 The Tilapia was out of this world - topped off with a delicious medley of mint, onions and lemon leaves.
30980 I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty!
30981 Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed.
30982 Visited this great place last week with my parents and sister and we all had a great time!
30983 The service was a bit "in the weeds" but everyone was friendly and nice and the food was very good.
30984 The tour is worth the $5 and then some, very informative, and our guide was very funny and knew her stuff!
30985 products for sale are lovely and the  drive is worthwhile.
30986 It is a bit way out but it was different and a great way to spend Sunday.
30987 GPS do not like the address so try google maps and your phone/ipad it will get you there.
30988 This place is great.
30989 All the food is fresh and always good.
30990 They have a great happy hour daily with a very knowledgeable staff.
30991 I highly recommend this place.
30992 Attention all parents, nannies, guardians etc.
30993 Koko bees is tons of fun!
30994 The kids are all smiles & full of laughter.
30995 Terrific environment:  oodles of play houses,  dress ups, costumes, toys, themes & settings!
30996 The little ones imaginations can run wild.
30997 They even offer fantastic dance, sports, yoga and tumbling classes for the children!
30998 This is a great place to come with the kiddos!
30999 !
31000 I split the veggie platter with a friend and we only got just over half way through it.
31001 Got the rest to go.
31002 I couldn't wait until I had room to eat again so I could eat the leftovers.
31003 Sooo much good stuff.
31004 I'm usually not a glutton, but there are a precious few places where I lose all self control and beach myself and this is apparently one of them.
31005 We were there for an hour and half and asked all sorts of questions about how things were made and what they were.
31006 The lady that waited on us may have been the owner.
31007 She was cheerful and happily indulged our questions.
31008 It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating for large groups, but it also seems to be an authentic family outfit.
31009 They have a few beers in bottles and apparently authentic music.
31010 I'm sad that I'm moving out of this neighborhood right as this moved in!
31011 If I weren't leaving, I'd probably give up cooking entirely and just eat here every day, or try to get take-out.
31012 If you're downtown or on the east side of Phoenix, it's worth the trip.
31013 Really good ethnic places outside of the Italian/Chinese/Mexican/American mold are a treasure here in Phoenix.
31014 If you're from somewhere more metropolitan, you know what I'm talking about.
31015 West Bring friends, dates, clients, and employees here and impress them.
31016 Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start.
31017 When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain.
31018 We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate.
31019 The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out.
31020 The food was sub par.
31021 My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side.
31022 Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.
31023 Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer.
31024 Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all.
31025 Bruce saved my day, my computer crashed this morning and I gave him a call and he was able to come out same day.
31026 He went through my whole system at my office and even updated my anti-virus with a free AVG instead of paying for that crappy Norton service.
31027 He was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted.
31028 He saved my day and completed everything same day.
31029 Thank you Bruce!
31030 went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants!)
31031 and we decided we wanted to have a nice, sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night.
31032 Eddie's House fit the bill perfectly.
31033 Food - excellent.
31034 Tuna Tartar "nachos" were great.
31035 I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked.
31036 Also had a size of Fiddler's Ferns which I've only tried once before.
31037 they were excellent.
31038 Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent.
31039 Service - excellent.
31040 very nice waiter who was very attentive.
31041 Location - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path.
31042 Atmosphere - also excellent
31043 Prices - being from San Francisco, the prices were unbelievably reasonable.
31044 I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt.
31045 It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful!
31046 I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity.
31047 Love this spot - it's pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out.
31048 The bacon is awesome here!
31049 Their philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc.
31050 etc.
31051 The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business.
31052 Best breakfast in Phoenix that i've had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!
31053 The name is so misleading, because this is the most charming dining spot I've ever eaten!
31054 I dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it.
31055 First, it's location is tucked away near ASU campus in a quiet little neighborhood.
31056 It appears to be a converted home built in the early 1900's and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge, and I mean huge outdoor patio area.
31057 I only dined outside, but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here, why would you dine any other way!
31058 The service was excellent!
31059 The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend.
31060 The menu was amazing.
31061 I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here.
31062 They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion.
31063 It all looked so divine.
31064 And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes.
31065 So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return.
31066 I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup.
31067 The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough!
31068 It was that good.
31069 The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh.
31070 I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened.
31071 And the quiche was heavenly as well.
31072 Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor.
31073 Since I was here for lunch only, the prices were reasonable.
31074 I've heard at dinner it can get expensive.
31075 This was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once.
31076 Amazing.
31077 Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world.
31078 It is expensive, but as soon as you start, you'll know exactly where that money went.
31079 Seriously.
31080 Try it.
31081 Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.
31082 Wish there were some in LA.
31083 Man taste so good and flavor.
31084 The sushi was fresh and excellent!
31085 The service was almost too fast.
31086 I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.
31087 Our daughter loved the miso soup.
31088 The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not.
31089 If they have it, you can get it.
31090 I know we'll be going there often.
31091 One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place.
31092 It is not large either.
31093 If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice.
31094 If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill.
31095 Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq.
31096 Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq.
31097 If I won the lottery and just wanted to spend a few hours a week working, it would have to be in this store.
31098 One, because I would want to be there just to see all the THINGS all the time, and two, because I would be able to spend all my money there.
31099 This place rocks.
31100 This place has three buildings- the west one has pricier items, but the stuff is GORGEOUS (see previous lotto winning comment).
31101 The east one has very reasonably priced items, contains seasonal trinkets and specialty food items.
31102 The south building has kids stuff, pet items and clothing/purses as well as some home items.
31103 It is the BEST place to find a gift for someone, or spend your overtime check on something nice for yourself.
31104 Want nice stationary?
31105 A cute soup tureen?
31106 A garden item?
31107 New collar for your dog?
31108 Fake fruit for your centerpiece?
31109 Gorgeous picture frames?
31110 Cute gauzy dress?
31111 Hip handbags?
31112 Pretty bangles?
31113 Antique key holders?
31114 Whimsical signage?
31115 Artful platters?
31116 Decorative bird cages?
31117 Catch my drift?
31118 They have EVERYTHING!
31119 :)
31120 Worse pizza I have had in a while.
31121 We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked.
31122 Crappy service too.
31123 Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing.
31124 .
31125 Service half ass.
31126 I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years.
31127 Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy.
31128 this place totally sucks.
31129 Love the convenience store.
31130 I stop every morning for a soda on my way to work.
31131 They are friendly, efficient and clean.
31132 I threw my friends bachelorette party here this Sat and had an amazing time!
31133 Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking.
31134 Makes for a perfect mix!
31135 We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in.
31136 They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool.
31137 We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didn't get one complaint!
31138 We stayed at shade, the club upstairs by the pool, until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool.
31139 I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long!
31140 Shade also plays great music which we loved.
31141 Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.
31142 I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table.
31143 Her name was Haley.
31144 She was not very responsive and didn't return my calls, emails or texts.
31145 I wanted to decorate our table but wasn't sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions.
31146 But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble.
31147 This was enough of a redemption for us.
31148 It couldn't have went better!
31149 Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night!
31150 !
31151 a weekend of debauchery was spent here when i was 18.  somehow we broke two lamps that were hanging on the walls.
31152 like high up on the walls.
31153 like above head level.
31154 don't ask, because i don't remember how it happened either.
31155 we tried to steal lamps from other rooms, but the maids kept catching us.
31156 so we wrote, "I O U 2 LAMPS :(" on one of the lampshades and left it at that.
31157 one night, my friend jonathan got really drunk and angry and lonely, went to the pool, and threw all of the poolside furniture into the pool.
31158 we seriously destroyed that motel.
31159 i'm not kidding, there was so much filth in one of our rooms that you couldn't see the carpet.
31160 i felt really, really bad for whoever had to clean that up.
31161 but the best part was that we didn't get charged for any damage we caused.
31162 thanks, motel 6!
31163 no wonder my useful points are so low... i use yelp more often to showcase my anecdotes than to actually review things.
31164 i'm useless!
31165 I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out.
31166 It was HORRIBLE.
31167 And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad.
31168 And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous!
31169 I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try.
31170 I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply.
31171 Seriously, zero out of four could give me one "great" dish!
31172 I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!?
31173 It's absolutely baffling!
31174 I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls.
31175 The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container.
31176 But when i ate it - UGH!
31177 The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh!
31178 I can't even talk about it.
31179 Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract!
31180 I'm still sick from those few bites!
31181 [Truly.]
31182 And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat!
31183 In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE!
31184 It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!!
31185 How's that for a combo?
31186 Ugh...... [stomach turning]
31187 I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me.
31188 Grateful even when i am paying.
31189 But during "tough times" when i actually "treat" myself and then plunk down $20(!!)
31190 for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable!
31191 Shame on you, George, for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall.
31192 No wonder the place was (not) hopping on a Saturday night!
31193 Simply one of the worst meals EVER.
31194 NOTE: This review concerns the Roberto's on Union Hills and 7th Ave. NOT the Roberto's in Anthem!
31195 I am only giving it one star because I can't give it 0.
31196 Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently.
31197 This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness.
31198 I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill.
31199 Now they are closed on Sunday's.
31200 I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone.
31201 they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Drive-ins and Dives days.
31202 the guy that both took my order and cooked my food was obviously drunk.
31203 sitting on his cellphone playing what appeared to be a video game when i walked in.
31204 After stepping off the plane hungry, I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate.
31205 "Wait a minute, I'm in Arizona.
31206 I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food.
31207 Is that a burrito place?
31208 Surely it can't be bad."
31209 I ordered a #1, standard burrito.
31210 I take a bite.
31211 And another.
31212 "Not bad I thought."
31213 Then I took another bite.
31214 And promptly spit it out.
31215 The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy.
31216 And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese.
31217 It was even obvious visually.
31218 After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as "the bag was just opened, it's not possible" even after showing the obvious mold.
31219 People around me started looking uncomfortable.
31220 Someone muttered "wow" and stepped out of the line.
31221 The best part?
31222 I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito, or an apology for the moldy burrito.
31223 Are you kidding me?
31224 I used to love Quiznos....
31225 I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day.
31226 At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop.
31227 The staff is rude and careless.
31228 I was given obviously bad guacamole...
31229 Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth.
31230 It took 20 mins to get my sandwich, there was only one couple in front me.
31231 I'm done with this place.
31232 I should have went to paradise bakery across the street.
31233 If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles.
31234 A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable.
31235 A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out.
31236 Yay!
31237 MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!
31238 I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.
31239 Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.
31240 On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.
31241 But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.
31242 Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.
31243 First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).
31244 We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.
31245 Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.
31246 It looked funny.
31247 It tasted funny.
31248 The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.
31249 If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.
31250 I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with "seasonal vegetables" and "homemade mashed potatoes".
31251 Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?
31252 That's a feat.
31253 My "homemade" mashed potatoes?
31254 Cold.
31255 A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress "the problem" .
31256 Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling.
31257 After all this, they sincerely asked us if "everything was all right" and "would we care to order dessert".
31258 At least they have a sense of humor.
31259 Never again.
31260 A philosophical elder of my profession commonly says "Everyone needs three vices.
31261 Sex and chocolate don't count."
31262 If I still lived in Phoenix, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles would definitely be one of my vices.
31263 The chicken is pure fried goodness.
31264 The mac n'cheese is creamy and crispy goodness.
31265 The waffles are BEYOND DELICIOUS.
31266 If I could give any future LoLo's consumers a hint it would be this: if you are sensitive to too much sugar like I am, don't waste your precious pancreatic islets on the beverages.
31267 I succumbed to the peer-pressure and got an Arnold Palmer, which of course comes in a quart-sized Mason jar.
31268 I reached my sugar capacity before the meal even started.
31269 I can only imagine the explosion of flavor in my mouth I would have experienced had I not wasted all my buds on sweetened tea and lemonade.
31270 Yum!
31271 The toasted barley app is delicious.
31272 My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger.
31273 Both of the sandwiches were outstanding.
31274 The service was great too.
31275 We will definitely go back.
31276 I am giving this location 5 stars cause its been my stomping grounds for atleast 12 years now, its always very good, clean, and I have never had a bad experience here.
31277 Wendys locations are just class acts, they are always my go to burger fix.
31278 I also made this my daughters first burger when she wanted to finally try one so she could have a good experience for the first one and always have a tasty burger to judge the rest by for her life.
31279 If its good enough for my daughter, then its good enough for you :) eat up and review.
31280 The location has closed (AGAIN).
31281 Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.
31282 Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.
31283 Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says "business closed".
31284 I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.
31285 The food quality is high and consistant.
31286 The prices are downright CHEAP.
31287 I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.
31288 The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.
31289 Best pasta I have ever had.
31290 Don't go there if you're looking for a two-pound chicken parm or endless breadticks.
31291 This is my new addiction!
31292 Took some friends and family here to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was her first time and she had a blast.
31293 Our first chef Poncho isn't at this location any more which we were disappointed about but ended up having another great chef named Sam.
31294 He was funny and the food was great!
31295 I tried grilled shrimp for the first time and I am a fan.
31296 Our waitress was awesome!
31297 On top of everything, funny and she told us Sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him, seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this.
31298 We have also had dinner on the patio when it was cooler out and enjoyed it too.
31299 I will be eating here often.
31300 Thanks Hayashi for always making my dining experience fun and delicious
31301 This is the only work of his that I have seen in person.
31302 After living in the valley since 2002, I FINALLY decided to head out that way.
31303 I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting.
31304 The house was amazing and beautiful.
31305 I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete, and the lines that created a flow.
31306 I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form, function, and beauty.
31307 First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.
31308 I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said " do you want to consign your table or not!".
31309 Quite rude.
31310 That was a turn of for me.....
31311 The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.
31312 The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.
31313 There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.
31314 Needless to say, I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!
31315 I love Gabriel.
31316 He does an amazing job every single time I'm there.
31317 I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great.
31318 His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood.
31319 The salon is always clean and comfortable.
31320 I never feel like I'm being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions.
31321 I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him.
31322 My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides.
31323 If you want a good meal that will fill ya up, for a fair price...Wally's is a great choice!
31324 The menu has great variety.
31325 If you want a burger, there are many to choose from.
31326 Each is huge and juicy, and comes with your choice of a side....go with the blended fries that include deliciious sweet potato fries.
31327 Want a salad?
31328 Again, many to choose from...my favorite is the chinese chicken.
31329 And, in case you missed my earlier comments, expect a BIG salad.
31330 And, if you're not watching your calories, then try any of their specialty mac'n'cheese dishes.
31331 WOW!
31332 I can't comment on the desserts because I can't eat anything beyond the entrees...but, I've seen others order a dessert; they looked yummy and - you guessed it - HUGE!
31333 And, here's the thing about Wally's:  they're "good people".
31334 in addition to providing you with a great meal, Wally's staff are active supporters of non-profit organizations in the greater Phoenix area.
31335 I have first-hand knowledge of their support for the Valley of the Sun Unted Way, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale.
31336 I have no doubt they support other causes.
31337 Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF-25B Coffee Roaster, in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost.
31338 It's.
31339 That.
31340 Good.
31341 At length: A trip to Kauai for our friends' wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony: the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit.
31342 Our friends are still together eight years later, but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish.
31343 Disconsolate from my long lost love, I have abstained from the hot dog community (except for Ted's, because it's amazing and what happens in Tempe, stays in Tempe) until a new beau arrived: Maui Dog.
31344 In short (ish): Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got Maui Dog in my tummy.
31345 I tried the Sweet & Spicy Dog (favorite!!!)
31346 and the Lava Dog (messy!!!)
31347 and the house made fries.
31348 Everything was delish, and I'll be back to try the rest.
31349 The restaurant is a cute, clean, pseudo-dive (kind of a Two Hippies vibe) with a few tables inside and a dog-friendly patio (tee-hee).
31350 It's funky and it's affordable.
31351 Go ahead, try it.
31352 You just might fall in love.
31353 The service here was wonderful, really friendly and personable.
31354 And the food was OUTSTANDING!
31355 That Brulee burger was perfection, paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake.
31356 I wanted to stay in town another day, just to come back here to eat!
31357 Best sushi in town.
31358 I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months.
31359 I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.
31360 The Scottsdale locations are GREAT!
31361 They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.
31362 What is it with the Camelback crowd?
31363 The place really smells bad!
31364 It really needs a good cleaning.
31365 There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.
31366 I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched!
31367 UGH!!!
31368 Good God!
31369 I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves??
31370 The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.
31371 It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!
31372 I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue!
31373 Maybe then they may clean up their act.
31374 Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here.
31375 I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself.
31376 Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy.
31377 Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well.
31378 Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price.
31379 Won't be ordering from here again.
31380 Disappointing :(
31381 Be sure to see Taylor, her service is great, the food is awesome, had roast beef sandwich ...and a plank of bruschetta!
31382 But without good service the experience lacks.
31383 Be sure to try it out.
31384 I am a huge "foodie", from a long line of "foodies".
31385 I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining.
31386 This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER!
31387 I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at!
31388 If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy.
31389 Everyone is super friendly.
31390 The place is very clean.
31391 Prices are amazing!
31392 Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food.
31393 Huge portions and great quality food.
31394 I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care.
31395 I feel like home here.
31396 Everything on the menu is delicious!
31397 I've tried almost everything.
31398 Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :
31399 O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes!
31400 you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table).
31401 Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing!
31402 I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts!
31403 Just delicious!
31404 I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret.
31405 DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR!
31406 This place is the best, bottom line.
31407 Try it.
31408 You will be hooked.
31409 It is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning.
31410 The Parlor seems to be nailing it.
31411 Hip yet comfortable decor.
31412 Very creative design, and I loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant Salon de Venus.
31413 As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile, and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered.
31414 Ah the food!
31415 Fresh ingredients, a great light pizza crust, and an original beet salad all  had us raving.
31416 The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best, would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream.
31417 But why nit pic?
31418 This place is a big hit, from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden,  to the fantastic staff and the  savory food, this place is already on my regular rotation.
31419 We were staying at the Claredon and the desk clerk (who is also from Yuma) told us that their restaurant was voted best Mex in Phoenix and she swore it was true so we had to try it.
31420 The elote (roasted corn with cheese and smokey paprika) was fab, as was the ceviche!
31421 The carne asasda taco was tasty, as so many have already said.
31422 The real stars, however, were the pork belly and vegie tacos.
31423 I'll be dreaming about those til our next trip north.
31424 Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters.
31425 I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings.
31426 Their portions are just right.
31427 If you don't like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy.
31428 I also love the condiments they serve before the meal.
31429 Love it!
31430 I like their decor.
31431 The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you're at an asian restaurant.
31432 Everything is neat and clean (even the bathrooms).
31433 I love this place!
31434 I've been here twice now and walked out with great finds both times.
31435 They have a large variety of clothes - work-appropriate & fun cocktail dresses, fabulous shoes, jewelry, casual skirts and shirts, and more.
31436 The employees are very friendly and helpful.
31437 Another reviewer mentioned $700 boots, but I haven't seen a single item priced over $100.
31438 I actually got gifts for my cousins, 2 hair and jewelry items apiece, for under $20 per person (and in the same visit found a dress for less than $40 that got me half a dozen compliments at a holiday party that night!)
31439 After weeks of anticipation, Side Bar has finally opened.
31440 As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.
31441 The attention to detail is amazing.
31442 Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.
31443 Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area.
31444 Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.
31445 The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.
31446 No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.
31447 Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.
31448 There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.
31449 Behind the bar you'll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.
31450 Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.
31451 The "soft opening" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.
31452 I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.
31453 Both were very good.
31454 Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.
31455 I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.
31456 After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.
31457 In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.
31458 Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.
31459 The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.
31460 Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.
31461 Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoe's Kitchen.
31462 If you're looking for a unique hangout in an urban setting, then Side Bar comes highly recommended.
31463 Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.
31464 All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.
31465 I highly recommend their pancakes.
31466 Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.
31467 I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.
31468 My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.
31469 The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.
31470 We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.
31471 It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.
31472 The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.
31473 The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.
31474 My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.
31475 I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.
31476 I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.
31477 The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.
31478 The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor.
31479 As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.
31480 I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.
31481 We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.
31482 The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.
31483 The key lime was tart and delicious.
31484 The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.
31485 It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.
31486 * I didn't know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata
31487 This is my love note:
31488 Yours beers are so delicious, your food is absolutely scrumptious.
31489 I wish I could spend forever and always with you.
31490 If I could just never work and sit inside of you all day eating and drinking, why, I think I would be the happiest gal on this side of the Mississippi River.
31491 You are great, don't change, and please, stay with me forever and always.
31492 I love you to the moon and the stars Handlebar,
31493 Katlan
31494 This location is now closed.
31495 I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend.
31496 I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food.
31497 Little Italy did not disappoint!!
31498 I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!!
31499 Plus the service was great too.
31500 Fast and friendly.
31501 Chef Bianco does it again!
31502 The homemade pasta is unreal.
31503 You can actually taste the freshness of all of the ingredients.
31504 The pasta is thick (like homemade pasta is supposed to be...) but not heavy at all.
31505 I also loved the casual vibe and the staff was very friendly and nice.
31506 You really feel like a guest sitting in the kitchen in a home somewhere in Italy.
31507 Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?
31508 Can someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drink?
31509 and worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.
31510 *one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter
31511 *minus the extra star for not having any matches
31512 Out of business
31513 Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....
31514 I go in what is your best chicken Idem....
31515 um Burrito or taco?
31516 he asks
31517 Have you had the Burrito?
31518 no....I haven't had ethier...
31519 Have any one eaten anything here?
31520 I ask the rest of the resturant crew....they All shake there heads no....
31521 ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del taco.....regardless I did eat a burrito.....
31522 and my worst fears where confirmed....I could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food......
31523 Feed me bad food once, shame on you.....Feed me bad food 4 times Shame on ME....
31524 I can't believe we get to review a free publication.
31525 Nonetheless, it's important to know (especially for Dave B., who obviously didn't do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great, creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.
31526 He decided this 17 years ago, and, despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no, the ads do not cover the full cost), continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.
31527 Notice that the photoshoots use local designers, local models, local photographers, and local locations.
31528 The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries, businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means, and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local), fashion shows (again, utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillard's show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.
31529 If the magazine doesn't seem critical enough, it's because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about, and therefore don't have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.
31530 When it's run by a local, written by locals, and put together in the publisher's dining room, I can't think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.
31531 The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.
31532 That's why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.
31533 That's also why you'll read the backstory on five locally owned, little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.
31534 The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn't been written about, or to local artists, designers or patrons of the arts.
31535 While it's always interesting to hear what people think of Java, knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month.
31536 This place was AMAZING!
31537 I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!
31538 Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls).
31539 Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace.
31540 The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories).
31541 Finally had a chance to watch a game here!
31542 Just moved to Surprise in July, and have been waiting for spring training.
31543 Very easy parking, and the seats are great!
31544 It does not matter where you sit.
31545 The diner have great food.
31546 I will be coming here a lot!
31547 Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.
31548 The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.
31549 The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!
31550 The service was not up to par either.
31551 I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.
31552 I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.
31553 That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.
31554 What is that 100% profit/mark up?
31555 I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.
31556 Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.
31557 My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.
31558 I would definitely not recommended this place.
31559 If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!
31560 The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!
31561 Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!
31562 You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!
31563 Well thought-through details make Lux amazeballs.
31564 The espresso is good.
31565 Really good.
31566 Like, I need to order an espresso along with whatever else I'm ordering just because it is so delicious.
31567 The food is beautifully presented (little light on the gluten free snacks, but there's fruit, so no one is starving).
31568 There's plugs all over.
31569 The furniture is mostly easy to wipe down.
31570 The bathroom door has written out instructions so no one is confused on when the door is locked.
31571 It also has nice smelling soap.
31572 The patio is really pretty.
31573 The clientele seems ridiculously cool.
31574 I kind of feel like maybe I'm going to be cooler by association if I hang out here.
31575 I'M GIVING IT A GO.
31576 Let me know how I'm doing.
31577 The best Burgers in Town!!!!!
31578 I have been hooked on their yummy burgers since the first bite.
31579 I used to always drive by this place and notice that the parking lot was always packed........and no wonder, they are Wonderful!!!!!
31580 Their custards are extremely yummy too :)  Worth the drive from North Scottsdale.
31581 I haven't tried anything else off their menu besides the burgers, custard and fries.
31582 Always tell myself that I will next time but when the time comes I just can't pass up my favs :)
31583 AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new "Dinner and a Movie" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (that's right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).
31584 No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea.
31585 I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger.
31586 Like "Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold.")
31587 Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket.
31588 Almost double for the nice seats.
31589 But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS.
31590 You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home.
31591 This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable.
31592 I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didn't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it.
31593 I seriously won't go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee you'll say the same once you go.
31594 FIVE STARS.
31595 One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.
31596 Our server "DK" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.
31597 As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.
31598 BAD DK!
31599 Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?)
31600 chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.
31601 I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.
31602 Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!
31603 DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something.
31604 Entering the store is visually overwhelming.
31605 There were so many things take in, I thought I'd found my new grocery store.
31606 I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out....
31607 After the ether wore I began to realize something.
31608 While the selection was wide, it look OLD.
31609 I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets.
31610 I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010.
31611 There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates.
31612 There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date.
31613 I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections.
31614 I have no idea why I haven't dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often, I've always had great service, great wine, and great food.
31615 There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it.
31616 The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5!
31617 Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends.
31618 The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can't make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying "just pick one!".
31619 Due to this fact, I've always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel.
31620 I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta.
31621 My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor.
31622 The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer.
31623 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious.
31624 The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside.
31625 The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love.
31626 The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town.
31627 The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away.
31628 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!
31629 Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado, almost three years ago.
31630 But for what it's worth, this is the best, most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far.
31631 =)
31632 Slow service, staff needs more training.
31633 There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it.
31634 Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service
31635 Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend.
31636 We both got "The Farmer's Feast" and it was truly amazing.
31637 I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much).
31638 I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here.
31639 The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses.
31640 Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet.
31641 Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum!
31642 For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam.
31643 His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites.
31644 For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious.
31645 The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet.
31646 I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy.
31647 For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats.
31648 Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves.
31649 For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing.
31650 One of the best deserts I have ever eaten.
31651 Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy.
31652 The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey.
31653 Just fantastic.
31654 The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try.
31655 I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option.
31656 Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.)
31657 I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt.
31658 There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much.
31659 However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes.
31660 Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all.
31661 Our server was extremely warm and friendly.
31662 She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her.
31663 She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together.
31664 Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately.
31665 I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional.
31666 They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself.
31667 With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it.
31668 It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax.
31669 The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!)
31670 or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next.
31671 I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine.
31672 It was pure food heaven.
31673 This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!
31674 We truly had fantastic night here.
31675 One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges).
31676 In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting.
31677 Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite "special occasion" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two.
31678 My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease.
31679 It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.
31680 Good service and good food!
31681 I ordered the burger sliders for lunch without the 1000 island dressing and loved them!
31682 A quick little meal for those on the go!
31683 The attendant even offered me a nice tall glass of ice water to go while I was waiting.
31684 I've been a regular here the past 3 years.
31685 Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation.
31686 Barb at Tees and More does a great job.
31687 They provided our company shirts and did a perfect job.
31688 Fast service, great service and great people.
31689 Mid size American airport with very good organization, very straight forward, no hassle.
31690 Security is a little slow and priority lane isn't really priority, it's more of "let's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed" lane, so let's welcome first class flyers with big giggle!
31691 !
31692 Many stores and food quality is okay.
31693 Seating areas are limited, at least for the Terminal 3 before security, so be aware.
31694 Lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place, there may be more volunteers than passengers.
31695 Haha.
31696 I did not know I could still be creative since it had been years since I had done anything that involves even a minor level of creativity.
31697 But what fun was this!
31698 A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon.
31699 We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making!
31700 My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways!
31701 For one we did not have to get all that dirty.
31702 Not dirty at all really.
31703 Also not that I mind dirty.
31704 This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go.
31705 And two - we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena.
31706 Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey.
31707 The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate (or item of the bride to be's choice) which we will then give to her as a wedding present.
31708 I thought this idea was really original.
31709 So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked.
31710 All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works.
31711 Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation.
31712 The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way.
31713 We finished about 4 hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity.
31714 Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted.
31715 I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs - but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon :)
31716 Go go here for a stimulating outing with good friends/family/kids!
31717 Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi .
31718 Sleek ,beautiful interior and very ,very clean !
31719 This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open ,seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area ,a very good design flow,indeed.
31720 The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating .
31721 The service has always been wonderful ,the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation .We like to get the sushi boat , edamame ,and beef yakitori.The fire dragon rolls( though on the small side) are also yummy.
31722 Drinks are very good here ..the sinful orchid (yum)a very pretty drink .And their HH is really good as well .
31723 Waffle House was packed, Over heard another couple taking about "Fast Eddies", With a 20 min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out.
31724 Walked in looked like a senior center.
31725 Tables and chairs were very out dated.
31726 We sat down in a booth.
31727 Food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty.
31728 Waitress came over after 10 min and asked what we wanted to drink.
31729 10 min later she brought out or coffee.
31730 Placed the order waited another 20 min to get the food.
31731 The diner wasn't busy at all.
31732 I don't know why the wait was so long.
31733 The food was ok, service was horrible.
31734 One thing that really grossed me out was the a/c return next to the office door.
31735 Look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected.
31736 I showed the waitress and she really didn't care.
31737 I told her that if I would of saw that when I came in I would of just walked out.
31738 GROSS!
31739 Sorry Waffle House I will never betray you again.
31740 This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.
31741 I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.
31742 I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.
31743 I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).
31744 Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.
31745 Really not sure what the fuss is about.
31746 If it's an emergency, they will generally see you asap.
31747 When we used to live in Desert Ridge, we had 2 dogs, 2 cats, there were times when I needed a vet immediately, and generally they will accommodate you in such a demise.
31748 They see you pretty efficiently, but of course they will suggest things that I feel are not merited to add onto a bill, but it's your right to question their additions and refuse, of course.
31749 I've never found them to be arrogant or pushy, they will easily offer other options, or be ok with your decision.
31750 During 1 extremely difficult period with our beloved Rottie/Sheppard Mix, they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to his advancing old age - he was 17.
31751 They were happy to provided us with care during his aging.
31752 Sadly, it came to a point that his quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing him to continue in the state he was, and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put him down, the entire staff were so understanding, caring, and totally sympathetic to our demise.
31753 They allowed us to hold him, cradle him and pet him the whole time.
31754 We were allowed as much time as we wanted before, during and after the whole life-altering circumstance.
31755 They even sent us a sympathy card, signed by all the staff, after the terrible ordeal we went through.
31756 During another trying experience we had to endure, our boxer mix was attacked by another dog and needed emergency care.
31757 We were now closer, and under the care of the Tatum/Shea location, but they were unable to see us.
31758 This location was able to open up their schedule to see us under this distressing circumstance.
31759 They provided expert care and glad to say that he mended just fine, with no lasting ill-effects.
31760 I am not a connoisseur of cupcakes so I don't have a ton of references to use on this review.
31761 That being said, I'm not really a big fan of cupcakes either.
31762 This place is family owned and operated.
31763 There's a wife and husband who run the place and the wife's sister works there also, which I thought was great.
31764 It is in the strip mall towards the western end of the shopping center.
31765 I tried a variety of the flavors including the Reese With-a-spoon, and a chocolate, chocolate chip cupcake.
31766 Coworkers that I shared them with, who are cupcake aficionados, really enjoyed the lemon and red velvet versions.
31767 While slight pricey for a cupcake, (slightly north of $2 per cupcake) if you have a special occasion or just want a special treat these cupcakes are incredibly moist and delicious.
31768 They also do custom cakes and cake pops, though I can't speak to either of the latter two.
31769 So much food for so little money, and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat.
31770 If you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like Pizza and hotdogs...what kid does not like Pizza or a hotdog?
31771 I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good.
31772 I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria, but there really is not - it was great food, great service and fun for the kids (there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too (so the parents can enjoy their food too)
31773 My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too, and she said it was really tasty too.
31774 She loved it.
31775 The desserts were amazing too, and very filling --- SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY!
31776 I wish it was not so far away from Queen Creek, or I would hit it up so much more often!
31777 Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line.
31778 No, it's not the line ride.
31779 You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at.
31780 "Hey!
31781 What do you want?"
31782 Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either.
31783 Keep your cool and order your dogs.
31784 Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again.
31785 Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.
31786 Never fear though... because it is amazing.
31787 Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have.
31788 My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst.
31789 Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.
31790 The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at.
31791 One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about.
31792 My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot.
31793 One word can describe this place GROSS!!!
31794 The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment.
31795 The salsa was lame, the chips stale.
31796 There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice.
31797 Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints.
31798 We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!
31799 We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating!
31800 They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious.
31801 The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version.
31802 We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!)
31803 and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING.
31804 Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.
31805 Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!
31806 C'mon!
31807 Fresh sandwich lunch for $3?
31808 The place makes it to order, incredible variety of baguette style sandwiches.
31809 Cash only, but the have an ATM in the lobby with a low fee.
31810 Or is it no fee?
31811 Anyway, great coffee and drinks and teas.
31812 Line moves super fast.
31813 Number pickup system is funky.
31814 My family packs these things to take home on the plane!
31815 I'm fairly new to the whole Costco experience.
31816 Now that we've bought a house it's time to buckle down and buy in bulk!
31817 As as new user I'd thought it would be helpful to post the following neat services Costco has to offer:
31818 1.
31819 Great deals on contact lenses.
31820 Before I would buy my contacts from justlenses.com but through Costco I bought 8 boxes (a year's supply) and received $50 off!
31821 $25 off via instant rebate at the cashier and another $25 off via mail-in rebate which came in less than a month after the order.
31822 2.
31823 PIZZA AND HOT DOGS.
31824 The take out pizza is huge and only 9.99 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 1.50.
31825 These make for a delicious and quick lunch.
31826 They also have smoothies and salads if you're looking for something on the "lighter" side.
31827 3.
31828 Food expos come and go often.
31829 Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread, a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 12 bucks.
31830 The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased.
31831 It was well worth the money and super fresh!
31832 4.
31833 And here's where I feel Costco has really benefited me.
31834 My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel!
31835 I'm big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price.
31836 It included seven nights, hotel and round-trip airfare all for one great deal.
31837 The customer service agent I spoke with was friendly and more than willing to answer my 500 questions about travel.
31838 I would recommend Costco Travel to anybody looking for reliable customer service and excellent travel/airfare packages.
31839 PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine.
31840 The portions are HUGE!
31841 My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers.
31842 The menu prices are very reasonable.
31843 Including tip, we usually don't spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner.
31844 They are very personable and attentive to your needs.
31845 I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere.
31846 The lemon chicken is our favorite!!
31847 :) They are also very kid friendly.
31848 We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him!
31849 Highly recommend!
31850 girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market.
31851 If you haven't tried pho (pronounced fuh) , this is a great spot.
31852 Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.
31853 its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.
31854 i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.
31855 we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.
31856 Everything is fresh and tasty with great service.
31857 make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west!
31858 Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws:
31859 1.
31860 Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.
31861 This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.
31862 To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!
31863 !
31864 2.
31865 The "collection" here is 90% DVDs and "Dummies" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure.
31866 I was hoping to be the first to review Grayhawk Family Chiropractic, but I'm glad to see Heather feels the same way I do about them.
31867 Dr. Frank Sorrentino is a true professional.
31868 I've suffered from low back issues for years and Dr. Frank always knows how to treat the problem.
31869 Between regular visits and the website they set you up with to demonstrate stretches tailored to your condition I'm glad to report I've been in good shape for a while.
31870 Whether you have an ongoing issue or have just injured yourself Grayhawk Family Chiropractic is the place to go.
31871 This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience.
31872 It was delicious and I am eager to go back.
31873 The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes.
31874 They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesn't happen very often.)
31875 The service was great.
31876 You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons.
31877 The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes.
31878 We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup.
31879 This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty.
31880 We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.
31881 This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us!
31882 Can't wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba.
31883 This is hands down the best place for bagels...
31884 but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever.
31885 I just wish they would open on in Greenville.
31886 Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese...
31887 I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale...
31888 .n
31889 The wash ain't bad....but the process to get it done is pathetic.
31890 The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion.
31891 They try to upsell at every opportunity.
31892 Four cars backed up waiting to order their service...and the crew is standing around with no cars going thru.
31893 I'd rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management.
31894 I am very happy to say that Angela's truffles are taking off here in Cottonwood.
31895 I hope I am allowed to say I am a proud purveyor.
31896 When they arrived I was impressed by their design and further blown away by the flavor.
31897 (Tears in my eyes...) My darling, have no fear, there are people up here who understand flavor, quality and most importantly: Great Chocolate!
31898 My beautiful patrons have latched onto these delectable wonders and I am happy to say The Cocoa Palette will always have a place in Northern AZ Wine Country with Bonne Lait!
31899 Bravo mon ami!
31900 I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it.
31901 I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate.
31902 I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried.
31903 Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye.
31904 My husband was also not impressed with his food.
31905 If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's.
31906 I had a mani/pedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit..
31907 The place is clean and the specialists are very nice..
31908 Shocked this place has 4 stars.
31909 First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa.
31910 Well guess what both suck!
31911 Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!
31912 Well, it's fresh, and it's easy.
31913 Perfect words to describe this cute, clean little store!
31914 This was my fave F&E in Phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place.
31915 I STILL miss it, and I moved away from Phx over a year ago!
31916 I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples, (it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down).
31917 I appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in just-right amounts (as in, not so much that some of it will end up going bad).
31918 This market was also great for soups (their brand was my pick, although they have a selection of major brands as well); it was also my go-to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work (like the F&E pre-made burritos and pasta dishes).
31919 Check out frozen foods too-- there are reasonably priced items like tempura, and special organic seafood dishes I never found anywhere else.
31920 I also liked the casual setup of the checkout area, with the option for a cashier or self-serve.
31921 And...wait for it...
31922 I just found out they are opening at least two F&Es in Sacramento!!!
31923 (okay, that won't likely cause much of a stir with the Phoenix crowd, but I am so excited they'll be open in my area!)
31924 sslowest drive through ever!!
31925 !
31926 The food really is exceptional.
31927 Its like the chefs create these perfect little bites, and they literally are bites, of food that are so interesting to taste.
31928 I'd recommend the sampler dinner.
31929 I want to say it runs about $40- $50 but its worth it as long as you like what's included.
31930 IT IS EXPEN$IVE.
31931 BUT the BF and I have been dying to try out this restaurant due to all the rave reviews it has been receiving on Yelp.
31932 LUCKILY a Groupon appeared for NOCA and we jumped on the opportunity.
31933 Turned out the fab deal was only marginally helpful.
31934 Even with the Groupon it was still a $150 dinner (plus the cost of the groupon...).
31935 Granted we did get a bottle wine (but the cheapest we could find), espresso and a french press cafe...
31936 It's like you analyze how much everything costs as you're ordering and are still shocked when the bill comes- I hate that.
31937 Our reservation wasn't until 8:30pm at night, no big deal.
31938 The restaurant was still PACKED!
31939 AND people kept coming through the door!
31940 It is not a large venue.
31941 And the tables are CRAMMED, uber close together.
31942 I know that the four-some sitting next to us are going to Isreal next month, right after their family vacation to Minnesota....
31943 This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley.
31944 It's super cheap - 2.25 for adults, 1.00 for kids.
31945 You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler (weird).
31946 They have a snack bar.
31947 It's very clean.
31948 Oh and the most important part, they have a lazy river, two big water slides, a whirlpool, toddler play area with more slides, basketball, lap pool, diving boards....
31949 I think that's it.
31950 It's quite a drive but it's worth it.
31951 Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail.
31952 My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back.
31953 The town is really cute with tons of photo ops.
31954 We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge.
31955 We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it.
31956 For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap, RELAX....the kids love it.
31957 This 40 something mom loved it.
31958 It's free to just walk around.
31959 But definitely do the Mystery Shack.
31960 Weird and fun.
31961 I actually got dizzy in it.
31962 This place confirms why "hole in the wall" places are the best places to get food.
31963 Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there.
31964 Usually there is a long line; however, their service is quick.
31965 With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food, Rito's is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix.
31966 I always have a green chilli burrito and haven't quite ventured out to other things on their menu, but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer.
31967 I am furious.
31968 In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage.
31969 I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.
31970 As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that.
31971 BIG MISTAKE.
31972 Yesterday (the Friday before my "correctly" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle.
31973 According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues.
31974 Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist.
31975 GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.
31976 Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again.
31977 On my day off...again.
31978 To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today.
31979 Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again.
31980 Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm.
31981 I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part?
31982 They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.
31983 My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing.
31984 I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears.
31985 I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.
31986 I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area.
31987 At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy.
31988 As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.
31989 I was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices!
31990 There are several locations throughout the (east) valley.
31991 Treat yourself.
31992 You will be happy you did.
31993 Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved).
31994 I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place.
31995 The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable.
31996 The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls.
31997 The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???)
31998 to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am).
31999 Even though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity.
32000 This location opened up just 3 weeks ago, and offers high quality, natural products for mainly cats and dogs, although there is a very basic small animal section.
32001 The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious, healthier, and that don't have corn or soy in them.
32002 There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals.
32003 Also, there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.
32004 The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay, some treats, pellets, and toys.
32005 I wasn't too impressed with their rabbit selection, and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products.
32006 Jill, the manager, was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets.
32007 She showed me various treats, foods, and toys, and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health.
32008 She provided a free sample of some nice grain-free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor.com, which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats.
32009 This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat!
32010 This is the best ice cream I've ever had, bar none!
32011 I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!
32012 I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.
32013 I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)
32014 I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!
32015 Totally recommended!
32016 This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba!
32017 They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba (usually about 4!)
32018 unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2
32019 Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced.
32020 However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant.
32021 I really love this place.
32022 I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered?
32023 I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon).
32024 Simple and delicious.
32025 The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing.
32026 The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty.
32027 My husband and I LOVE El Metate... we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much.
32028 Their food is delicious, they are family owned and operated - always friendly.
32029 Their hot sauce is to die for, both green and red.
32030 It's possible I like El Metate better than Amados!
32031 One hour.
32032 That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here.
32033 A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.
32034 We arrived, found we had free valet parking?
32035 With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you.
32036 A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating?
32037 Also a plus.
32038 Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers?
32039 FAIL.
32040 On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij).
32041 We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music.
32042 We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order.
32043 Bam.
32044 So far so good...or so we thought.
32045 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of.
32046 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous "drive-by" waiter never returned.
32047 A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer.
32048 Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of:
32049 "I don't know why it's taking so long..."
32050 and
32051 "I put the ticket in right after I took your order..."
32052 So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen?
32053 Perchance?
32054 What do you think?
32055 FIFTEEN (15 == few?)
32056 minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough.
32057 Out the door we went.
32058 On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?)
32059 our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?
32060 Oh R E A L L Y?
32061 The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly.
32062 Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are:
32063 1) the furrowed eyebrows
32064 2) fuck-you facial expression
32065 and
32066 3) curling fists
32067 It seems that we are not alone in this.
32068 Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.
32069 I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews.
32070 There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live.
32071 I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.
32072 P.S.
32073 They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached).
32074 P.P.S.
32075 They all serve the same menu.
32076 It is NOT amazing.
32077 I have previously been to Dick's.
32078 Yes, it is good.
32079 No my socks did not come flying off.
32080 P.P.P.S.
32081 ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez.
32082 All of these places have exemplary service and food to match.
32083 Love the shows the promoters bring in.
32084 Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more.
32085 Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers.
32086 Oh well...
32087 Atmosphere is laid back, chill.
32088 A large patio.
32089 And yes, the Shaker Room.
32090 The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.
32091 I really love the chicken and how it already comes with pickles o.
32092 The sandwich ... Fave..
32093 I also love the buffalo sauce very addicting
32094 This place is great!
32095 We traveled from Anthem to find this little Turkish heaven.
32096 The drive was worth it.
32097 Loved everything about this place from the service to the food!
32098 Definitely be back.
32099 This place is great!
32100 I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees.
32101 Best customer service.
32102 Also, the variety of favors is fantastic!
32103 Wow these cupcakes were amazing!!
32104 The frosting was picture-perfect.
32105 I tried Vanilla Salted Caramel and Pumpkin and both were so good!
32106 The cake on both were super dense and moist.
32107 Vanilla Salted Caramel definitely was the best of the two!
32108 I am 5'0", so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service.
32109 I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services.
32110 I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied.
32111 They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors (I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain), everyone on staff is competent and very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week.
32112 I have only ever encountered one issue..when I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom, the cuff seemed loose.
32113 Since I didn't want it to get caught on something and come apart, I took them back to be adjusted.
32114 The second alteration was done in just a couple days (in winter, which tends to be a busy busy time for them) and the new stitching was nearly indestructible!
32115 The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory, because even after a year hiatus- they greeted me by name!
32116 I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business.
32117 I hope others follow suit.
32118 Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.
32119 Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land.
32120 I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table.
32121 The toppings are really special here.
32122 If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza.
32123 The lemon zest puts it over the top.
32124 The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite.
32125 The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man.
32126 It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.
32127 We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening.
32128 I couldn't get enough of it!
32129 It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.
32130 Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines.
32131 Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper.
32132 Cartel is my go to coffee place.
32133 If I could drink here everyday, I would.
32134 The barista who seems to always be working sunday mornings makes the best lattes that I've ever had, ever.
32135 Each one always has a cute little heart or leaf shaped on the top which obviously is their secret as to why they're so delicious.
32136 I've never gotten anything else because I've already discovered the best.
32137 If you're cool, you probably like to hang out here on the reg.
32138 I definitely recommend, best coffee in Tempe by far.
32139 It's a little hard to find if you've never been before, right off university on ash across from the circle k.
32140 As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again.
32141 Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good.
32142 I got the mongolian beef and it's like "wha?
32143 really?
32144 is this IRL?"
32145 I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of.
32146 If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.
32147 From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.
32148 Durant's is an icon and legend.
32149 Period.
32150 Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.
32151 I never order Filet, but when in Rome...
32152 Yeah, yeah, I know there are already like fifty-something reviews for this place, most of them four or five stars, I don't care.
32153 Here's one more, another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardson's awesomeness...
32154 The food's the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dick's Hideway around the corner, but eating here is a totally different experience.
32155 The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the high-backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party.
32156 I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops... OMG the scallops, so good when I think about 'em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like "OMG".
32157 Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here, I can't truly appreciate it because I don't eat the meat dishes, which, according to them, are even better.
32158 And they're probably right.
32159 They usually are.
32160 Went with a group of 6 last week, which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardson's can handle (for much larger groups there's a private room available at Dick's).
32161 Service was super friendly and extremely efficient.
32162 Yeah, it can be a little pricy depending on what you order, but in my opinion, totally worth it.
32163 Sometimes you gotta splurge.
32164 I LOVE White Lion Tea.
32165 The company uses great quality of everything!!
32166 !
32167 My favorites are Tuscany, Ginger Peach, Green Passion Tea, White Ambrosia Tea as far as I have tried :)
32168 Everytime I opened a tea bag, I have to take a good deep inhale from a tea bag.
32169 It's smell soooo great as the tea taste.
32170 Thank you White Lion for having such awesome products !!
32171 !
32172 The new Kale salad is to die for!
32173 I love this place!
32174 Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat!
32175 The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing.
32176 This is the best lunch place in the valley!
32177 The slices of pizza are cheap, huge, and very very good.
32178 I really don't have to say anymore.
32179 Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.
32180 Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.
32181 We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.
32182 He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.
32183 The food was luke-warm and nothing special.
32184 I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place, but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.
32185 Don't waste your money.
32186 I'd love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!
32187 !
32188 In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.
32189 I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.
32190 (Get it?
32191 Different Point of View.....?)
32192 Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu.
32193 There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.
32194 In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if you're ballin on a budget.
32195 Everything was AMAZING and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!
32196 Great multigrain sandwiches.
32197 Nice patio too!
32198 Where to start??
32199 ?
32200 The owners are very kind... say hi to Benny in the kitchen!!
32201 !
32202 My wife and I found this place while living in the culinary-void NW Valley of Phoenix, and we have eaten here probably 50 times over a 3-year period.
32203 Everything is good:
32204 Gryos
32205 Chicken Pita
32206 Souvlaki
32207 Greek Salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eaten
32208 Fries are always fresh
32209 Zatsiki sauce is stellar
32210 The atmosphere is a bit void, but people don't come to 35th and Thunderbird for the atmosphere...  they come for great food at a great price.
32211 This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS.
32212 The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time.
32213 They were playing songs I never heard of so I know I'm going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone!
32214 Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks.
32215 They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool.
32216 If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......
32217 little known secret- the golf course bar!!!!
32218 amazing margaritas and a super-cheap happy hour.
32219 didn't mind watching the cute guys checking in after a long day of golfing, either!
32220 my bff and i were so happy to have stopped here after our day at the spa.
32221 We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here.
32222 The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable.
32223 The staff here are topnotch.
32224 I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings.
32225 We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre.
32226 There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area.
32227 It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event.
32228 I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena.
32229 I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews.
32230 Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco, green chile stew and pecan/fig pie), but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout.
32231 So many places have arrogant, stuffy service, so Scottsdale.
32232 Not so here.
32233 Also, the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why.
32234 Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us).
32235 The food is rich, but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce.
32236 Perfect portion size, with a balance - meat, grains and veggies.
32237 So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood!
32238 (Oh - and no valet!
32239 I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot, and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots.)
32240 I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food,  friendly service and excellent value.
32241 I had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries.
32242 They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce, tomato and onion.
32243 We will definitely go there again.
32244 One of my fav sushi places in the Valley.
32245 Great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or still is unsure of what they like.
32246 Great place to take someone who loves sushi but is indecisive.
32247 Some of my favorites include the spicy shrimp/crab roll, Phoenix roll, and their squid salad.
32248 Plus - you can't beat the Vegas roll - $1.50 for 3 pieces?
32249 It's a steal!
32250 Definitely one of the more fun sushi places in the Valley!
32251 I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to.
32252 The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there.
32253 The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all.
32254 I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys.
32255 I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave.
32256 I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream.
32257 Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it.
32258 The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy.
32259 We found Ippei happhazardly through United Airline's dining points program and were instantly hooked.
32260 We now frequent the place at least once or twice a week.
32261 A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host, Michael.
32262 It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place, without the attitude and pompous feel.
32263 The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant.
32264 The drinks are creative.
32265 And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.
32266 I'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.
32267 I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.
32268 Prices are very reasonable.
32269 This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.
32270 Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.
32271 As it is now, you can just walk in.
32272 Great place to bring a date - low lighting, great service, great food, lots of fun.
32273 Very clean with and old fashion cinema atmosphere.
32274 Snacks are very expensive so if popcorn and soda are a must for you, expect to spend alot of money.
32275 The amazing reclining seats are worth it though.
32276 I definitly recomend Cinemark 16 as the place to go to watch movies!
32277    Also there are alot of great eating places next to it or within walking distance to do the dinner  and movie date night!
32278 This is one of our favorite pizza places - for the food, value, drinks and great atmosphere!
32279 I originally discovered them at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, and am so happy I did!
32280 It is in a great location, walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so it's a great place to start the night in Old Town.
32281 My husband and I's favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza.
32282 The crust is so crisp and perfect!
32283 As for drinks, Jac's has a really fun cocktail menu, and also a good wine selection.
32284 Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Cabernet Sauvignon.
32285 Affordable, smooth, and pretty cool that half of the profits are donated to charity.
32286 Definitely check this place out, you'll love it!
32287 I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous.
32288 RIDICULOUS.
32289 Elderly people work here or volunteer.
32290 You expect customer service that you'd receive at a high-end store.
32291 No.
32292 People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices.
32293 No, the people there will not be making sure you're finding everything okay, you're on your own... and that's how it should be when you're thrifting.
32294 I usually find great things.
32295 Glasswares, books, shoes, purses.
32296 They have amazing furniture that is so cheap.
32297 They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week.
32298 Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays.
32299 Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is.
32300 I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed.
32301 Oh, and we eat a little too.
32302 Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut.
32303 The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink.
32304 Did you hear me??
32305 FORGOT TO DRINK!
32306 !
32307 Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options.
32308 I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg.
32309 Ho-ly shit.
32310 Each bite became increasingly better than the last.
32311 It was the perfect bite over and over and over again.
32312 The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly.
32313 And it was huge.
32314 I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.
32315 My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast.
32316 To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast.
32317 It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.
32318 I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal.
32319 Me.
32320 Ignoring anything in a champagne flute.
32321 I know.
32322 I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!
32323 This place is home.
32324 These guys are great!I  Even though they specialize in Mercedes, they never have a problem with my BMW X5.
32325 The owner, Charles, knows what he is doing and never tries to up-sell you on unnecessary work.
32326 Mary (Charles' wife) is a really sweet lady who always gives me a ride home and picks me up when the car is ready.
32327 While Aurohaus doesn't have loaner cars like the dealership, they are extremely competent, trustworthy, and charge reasonable prices for their services.
32328 HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience.
32329 On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations.
32330 We would have easily spent $250+.
32331 Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.
32332 Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc.
32333 We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.
32334 When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.
32335 When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.
32336 Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc.
32337 Needless to say, we were stunned.
32338 The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration.
32339 However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal.
32340 It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.
32341 What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service.
32342 wow.
32343 this place is a gem.
32344 highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine.
32345 visited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night.
32346 i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego.
32347 as for food, our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style.
32348 we all enjoyed all of it, i especially recommend the fig chutney, that was absolutely amazing.
32349 from the sandwiches, the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite.
32350 overall, everything was very good and the service was great.
32351 as for the wine, great selection.
32352 the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like.
32353 in fact, i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them.
32354 if you're a wino like me, you'll love this place.
32355 as for the ambiance, they nailed it.
32356 awesome patio and great decor.
32357 the attention to detail is definitely noticeable.
32358 very chill spot.
32359 ps.
32360 check out the door to their wine cellar, i want that in my house.
32361 it's gorgeous.
32362 Yum!
32363 Healthy selections and delicious flavors!
32364 If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would have to be at FnB.
32365 This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms.
32366 Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures.
32367 Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite.
32368 Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect.
32369 Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time.
32370 Service is professional, attentive and friendly.
32371 Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday.
32372 They served us stale rice.
32373 Average main dishes, not as flavorful.
32374 Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.
32375 Overpriced.
32376 Two weeks after I dropped off my computer for service with the Geek Squad I got it back with a new screen and hand rest.
32377 They said 3 weeks and I got it in two!!!
32378 And the open-box computer I purchased to use while mine was in the shop was returned with no problems.
32379 I was so happy we purchased a new Toshiba DVD player for $40.
32380 Who knew that DVD players could be so cheap?
32381 I've been using it all day and it works beatifully.
32382 i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak.
32383 and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am.
32384 i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat, because i think it's just psychologically strange.
32385 BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu.
32386 and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.
32387 my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger.
32388 i could eat these everyday.
32389 it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out.
32390 it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce.
32391 this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware.
32392 their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned.
32393 also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch.
32394 their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious.
32395 i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos.
32396 their pita chips and hummus are to die for.
32397 they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus.
32398 and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.
32399 green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head.
32400 Contrary to the reviwers below...I love Matt's.
32401 Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...
32402 BUT....
32403 This is Phoenix people.
32404 When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's.
32405 I love breakfast.
32406 I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business.
32407 I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's.
32408 Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.
32409 I wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long.
32410 But as a special breakfast treat...you can't beat it.
32411 Just bring your own fan.
32412 For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.
32413 From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what I'm looking for.
32414 The prices don't really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.
32415 When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.
32416 A+!
32417 Not lesbian/gay friendly at all.
32418 I should have read the previous review before going.
32419 I'm almost hesitant to tell you about my favorite sushi place because it's already pretty busy...
32420 But oh well.
32421 I love Sakana.
32422 It's a comfortable restaurant, I don't feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there.
32423 Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall turn you off, inside is small, but nice.
32424 Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean- that's so important when dealing wih sashimi.
32425 We've taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed.
32426 We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too.
32427 Their service staff are authentic and sweet.
32428 I've never been disappointed.
32429 Now....stay away...cause I don't want to wait for a table....
32430 We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.
32431 However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.
32432 We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).
32433 This employee could not help us either as "he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it."
32434 I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home.
32435 While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these "stupid" machines.
32436 After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.
32437 Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.
32438 Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services.
32439 I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there.
32440 Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city!
32441 I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany!
32442 We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias, but it was so dark that we couldn't see much.
32443 I'm glad we returned in the daylight.
32444 We took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG.
32445 My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him.
32446 We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.
32447 I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus.
32448 There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.
32449 We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.
32450 There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like.
32451 We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time.
32452 You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.
32453 A very nice place to take visitors on a nice day.
32454 I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers & More during Fat Tuesday yesterday.
32455 There are a tremendous variety, including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger.
32456 The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings.
32457 I had the turkey burger, and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted.
32458 Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts, but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean.
32459 I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order.
32460 You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip.
32461 The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger.
32462 Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid.
32463 Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell.
32464 A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop.
32465 About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store.
32466 For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it.
32467 After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.
32468 Well, first off, It's 24 hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning.
32469 The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window.
32470 Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available.
32471 I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way.
32472 Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy.
32473 I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts.
32474 When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.
32475 Anyway, the donuts are awesome.
32476 Best tasting donuts I've ever had.
32477 I probably shouldn't make it a habit to come here twice a week, if I want to live past forty, but I'll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on.
32478 Hope this place sticks around.
32479 We went there right before my Grandma's 100th birthday.
32480 There were about 20 of us.
32481 The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn't have a final count of people.
32482 The place was busy but I know why.
32483 EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.
32484 Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.
32485 We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.
32486 Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!
32487 The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!
32488 Definitely the best choice of eating chinese food in the city where you have limited good Asian food around.
32489 The Singapore street noodle (curry noodle) is always been my favorite and the crab wonton is just a great appetizer to start!
32490 I also like their orange beef!
32491 Definitely worth to eat for!
32492 "You want a piece of me?"
32493 said the gargantuan mango tango eggees cup.
32494 I said "YES, I DO!"
32495 and give me a big ol veggie samich and some fries to go with my brain freeze thank you very much.
32496 Todays order is same ol same ol 12 inch whole wheat extra veggie grinder with extra crispy fries and a bigee flavor (mango tango) $6.50 w/ the captain card.
32497 How can you beat this kind of scratch for two people.
32498 you cannot.
32499 It was Yuuuummmmae!
32500 Unfortunately there is not much choice for vegan here but its all about the eegees!
32501 I now will add eegees to Best vegan for the money!
32502 and to Best far away vegan.
32503 Check it!
32504 you will be glad you did!
32505 Review time
32506 Curbage: 10 I really like the fancy shmancy new eegees,but I like all eegees
32507 P factor: 10 very clean as usual
32508 Ordering: 10 no wait at all
32509 Meal arrival: 10 even with extra crispy fries it was fast
32510 Taste test: 10 yummy today and the mango tango is now my second fav to cherry cider
32511 Summary: 10 Thank you eegees!
32512 see you next month.
32513 Late gordo
32514 I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.
32515 Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.
32516 Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.
32517 4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals.
32518 Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.
32519 Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.
32520 Delivery is free, and on time.
32521 The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).
32522 They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.
32523 And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.
32524 So really, you should just try it.
32525 Okay?
32526 Okay.
32527 Delicious yet again!
32528 Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong.
32529 The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome!
32530 It's BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so don't forget to tip well!
32531 If you're eating and there's a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people don't have to wait an hour.
32532 Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!
32533 We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!
32534 Delicious!
32535 I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!
32536 Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.
32537 I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!
32538 Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.
32539 Best hand made pastas anywhere.
32540 Perfect!
32541 Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!
32542 So right...so full!
32543 I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!
32544 We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!
32545 What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!
32546 We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.
32547 Best in the valley.
32548 When I found out that they do banquets here, I was quick to make a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner.
32549 The service was as good as it gets...period.
32550 The food choices my wife and I had to decide on were plentiful, and the result was beyond fantastic!
32551 From the appetizers, to the main courses and finishing with yummy dessert...this place rocks.
32552 Fez is RIGHT down the street from where I work, hence due to its location + general fabulousness, it has become a regular spot for happy hour.
32553 Here's What we LOVE about Fez:
32554 -Sweet Potato Fries (sooo good--sprinkled with cinnamon by the way)
32555 -Kisra and Hummus!
32556 -The Black Bean Burger (the first time I ordered it, I asked the server: "Now, is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good?"
32557 She said, "I totally know what you mean, no this one is good.
32558 "-and she was right!)
32559 -Margarita Mondays (aka 2 for one Margaritas--check out the pomegranate one!!)
32560 -The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm
32561 -The friendly service
32562 -The close proximity to light rail
32563 Here's what we don't like as much:
32564 -The slow service (sometimes it gets kind of bad, I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order, get more water/another drink, or get your check)
32565 -When happy hour ends (I mean, who likes that anywhere?)
32566 Fez makes me very happy to work in downtown Phoenix.
32567 i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser.
32568 she's very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want.
32569 she is reasonably priced.
32570 This place was great... Well as great as a doctors visit can be.
32571 They called us (my son was the patient)  back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor.
32572 She was kind and took her time - asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son's health.
32573 This is true personal training at a fraction of the cost.
32574 It's fast, convenient, clean & friendly!
32575 You choose the style of fitness YOU want, and your workout program will be designed specifically for YOU.
32576 And you will see your progress after each session.
32577 AWESOME!!!
32578 I like it so much I'm going 6 days a week!
32579 If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.
32580 Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.
32581 They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.
32582 They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.
32583 The dessert is yummy as well.
32584 This is a must try!
32585 This place is disgusting!!
32586 The bun was dry and stale.
32587 The veggie burger was yucky...
32588 I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.
32589 The kids meals are miniscule.
32590 The topping bar is so simple and plain.
32591 The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!
32592 Drink choices stink.
32593 Cookies taste raw and boring.
32594 Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.
32595 I thought they were a total waste of calories.
32596 I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.
32597 Authentic mouth watering food.
32598 Got the steak fajitas dinner....extremely satisfied.
32599 I love that they are kid friendly and that chef Aaron came by to ask how everything was.
32600 Delicious food.
32601 I cannot believe I am about to say this:
32602 AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.
32603 For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.
32604 It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.
32605 I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.
32606 I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.
32607 I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.
32608 The bread was soft and warm.
32609 The meat was tender and tasty.
32610 The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.
32611 And HOT au jus?
32612 OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!
32613 I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.
32614 She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.
32615 AT AN AIRPORT?
32616 Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.
32617 I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!
32618 !
32619 This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!
32620 Amazing food and excellent service.
32621 LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
32622 One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth!
32623 I typically will get sorbet, and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet.
32624 I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations.
32625 After getting my sorbet, I enjoy sitting out on the patio.
32626 This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it.
32627 The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best.
32628 We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories.
32629 I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.
32630 And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.
32631 Mike and Rhonda's makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.
32632 For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.
32633 Come hungry or share.
32634 They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc.
32635 This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler.
32636 The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading.
32637 They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling.
32638 For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member.
32639 I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos.
32640 I was told "Too late" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints.
32641 Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store.
32642 I was told "No".
32643 I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them.
32644 I will not buy anything from them again.
32645 I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible.
32646 I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl.
32647 It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect.
32648 My hair is flatter than what I walked in with.
32649 My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat!
32650 Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before.
32651 I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.
32652 Update: They offered me a make up blow out.
32653 I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful.
32654 Mistake!
32655 Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service.
32656 I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response.
32657 Well, I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff, as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast.
32658 It was less than mediocre.
32659 Starting with the coffee, which tasted awful..it was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot!
32660 Unacceptable.
32661 I had bacon and eggs...fair.
32662 Asked for the hashbrowns to be well done..didn't make a difference, I guess, as they came out raw.
32663 Also, asked that my toast be dry...came out saturated with butter.
32664 My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy...you could have plastered a house with the gravy!
32665 As you can tell, we will not be returning.
32666 The reason we went, was because of their article in the paper this week.
32667 Just shows, that you can't believe believe everything you read.
32668 My husband, "jokingly, suggested, that we cancel the paper!
32669 I love, love, love the Keg!
32670 I've been to this location as well as San Tan Village, Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service.
32671 I really like the atmosphere, it has that dark, cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious.
32672 We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a "Keg sized" glass of Fetzer chardonnay, a margarita (very strong), the Keg Classic Dinner (ceasar salad, 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon, mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato), bacon wrapped scallops (an appetizer that I ordered for my entree) and their fabulous bread with whipped butter, YUM!
32673 Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu.
32674 The bill with tax and tip was $68, really an excellent value.
32675  Overall, a great meal and dining experience.
32676 I will definitely be back and can't wait!
32677 I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips.
32678 I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top.
32679 The lady assured me that they did.
32680 I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna.
32681 Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut.
32682 Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center.
32683 I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls.
32684 I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet.
32685 I am OBSESSED with Ra.
32686 Thank God that it is a chain restaurant otherwise I don't know how I would get my fix when in different states.
32687 I don't care what everyone says about the best sushi, blah blah blah.
32688 This place is THE best!
32689 First of all it has the BEST happy hour!
32690 I was introduced to the restaurant's best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous.
32691 My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon, Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers.
32692 The Sweet Onion Salmon's sauce is to die for, the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlic-type sauce!
32693 I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal.
32694 Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp, Uchi No Salad and Vegas Roll--basically any of the happy hour items are great!
32695 Oh and I can't forget about the desserts, if you have any room left you have to try the cinnamon tempura ice cream, but share it because it is very filling.
32696 The best Asaian store around.
32697 Love the selection.
32698 Awesome smoked herring for cheap.
32699 Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been.
32700 we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22..
32701 I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon.
32702 The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress.
32703 The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu.
32704 I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, "Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree.
32705 Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree.
32706 Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS."
32707 So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!?
32708 Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future.
32709 What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of In-N-Out Burger!
32710 Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels.
32711 I hope that when it opens in Dallas (yes, the plans for that are public), nothing changes.
32712 Steak cooked to perfection.
32713 The parking is my beef with this place.
32714 Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?
32715 If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.
32716 Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again.
32717 I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.
32718 Much better place.
32719 So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood.
32720 We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food.
32721 Luckily we found this little gem.
32722 Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.
32723 We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.
32724 Great sized portions for reasonable price.
32725 We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.
32726 I have a feeling we'll become regulars.
32727 As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley.
32728 It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CD's along the wall to get your music fix.
32729 I love how they have a list of recommended new releases.
32730 I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale.
32731 Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine.
32732 They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some!
32733 OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free "Magnet" magazine with each purchase.
32734 Woohoo!
32735 The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be.
32736 If you want up to date paper & quality product...go to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls!
32737 One of the most memorable breweries I've been to, not because of their personal beer choices but because of how they run the place.
32738 They have over 30 beers on tap from all over the country.
32739 If that's not cool enough, the entire back wall of the place is refrigerated coolers full of bottles and cans of even more craft brews that you can hand pick to drink in house...OR....build your own 6 pack to carry out.
32740 Brews from all over from Epic, to Dogfish, to Maui Brewing, to Sierra Nevada and the list goes on...and on....and on.
32741 It really is a nice concept!!
32742 Oh....and their food is great too.
32743 Mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty.
32744 As for the service?
32745 I was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge.
32746 They were able to help us pick the right beer for our liking and they were right there when the brews disappeared regardless of the fact the place was packed.
32747 Know before you go: Don't let the exterior fool you!
32748 It's a small portion of a strip mall...look hard or you may miss it
32749 Been a patron since this eatery first opened.
32750 This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy.
32751 The food is that fabulous!
32752 My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf.
32753 My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup.
32754 The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich.
32755 The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour.
32756 Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.)
32757 Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch....I'm giving this place five stars and making sure I'm there before the rush hour.
32758 :-)  Happy Eats!
32759 I love this place.
32760 It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city!
32761 There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items.
32762 There is everything here from match boxes, cute purses and hats to retro/vintage furniture, wacky mannequins, old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over.
32763 And!
32764 They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff.
32765 Jon, Tess, Charlie, Erin, Kathleen and whole gang are the best!!
32766 !
32767 Our waiter was Vincent.
32768 Very polite, helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item.
32769 Service was A+!
32770 The food was fantastic.
32771 No errors, was tasteful, unique, and fresh!
32772 I will definitely come here again.
32773 Holy WOW Batman!
32774 This place is ONE-OF-A-KIND...it's Awesometown & it's YUMMY!
32775 Once you step inside you'll instantly  get the picture.
32776 It's WOW factor is off the meter.
32777 Smeeks sells a never ending selection of treats of all kinds...it's THE PLACE for unique, off the wall, goofy gifts.
32778 AND CANDY.
32779 I give a big round of applause to LOCAL, small business owners who stick their necks out in ANY economic climate but in today's woe-filled world of running a business, they become instant SUPER HEROES!
32780 If a picture is worth a thousand words, you can take a peek at 25,000 more reasons to visit Smeeks here:
32781 http://monkeywonderland.com/blog/
32782 Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.
32783 Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.
32784 I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.
32785 My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.
32786 Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.
32787 You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.
32788 I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away
32789 The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.
32790 I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.
32791 OH MAHHH GOSH, what retards they have working here.
32792 Came in to pay for my phone bill and literally stood in line for 40 effing minutes.
32793 They had TWO ppl out on the sales floor that afternoon and the store was freaking packed.
32794 Really?
32795 What genius decided to schedule TWO freaking meat-heads who knew diddly squat about anything on a busy Saturday afternoon???
32796 And no, I don't care to upgrade my phone.
32797 I JUST WANT TO PAY FOR MY BILL AND GTFO OF THERE!!!!
32798 Do you really think that after such poor service I am going to want to up your commission rate by purchasing/upgrading my phone with you?
32799 NO.
32800 Definitely an awesome buffet.
32801 Not your typical buffet stereotype.
32802 Love the sushi.
32803 Great variety of things to have.
32804 If memory serves,  it was 19.99 when I was there.
32805 I think a tad high, but someone mentioned 25 bucks, so maybe it's come down :-?
32806 Sake is priced well, and the beers.
32807 MMMMM.
32808 Let me break it down for you...when you can hear staff in the kitchen saying "oh wow, that looks amazing" as plates are coming up in the window, you're in for a treat.
32809 I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them....!
32810 Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok!
32811 I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!).
32812 Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious.
32813 Eggplant is a must.
32814 You just HAVE TO get it, done.
32815 In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce.
32816 SO tasty.
32817 The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices.
32818 Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;).
32819 Know Before You Go:  I'm only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in, and that rocks!
32820 Big fan.
32821 Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago.
32822 Quality cut and great people.
32823 These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years.
32824 No froo froo!
32825 Russian not spoken there!
32826 Had lunch here with my wife today.
32827 It's the second time I've been and her first.
32828 After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time.
32829 They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix.
32830 The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything.
32831 Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs.
32832 The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce.
32833 Absolutely delicious.
32834 The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side.
32835 Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to.
32836 Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc.
32837 The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer).
32838 They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas.
32839 If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place.
32840 You will too.
32841 Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert.
32842 We had the latter - yum.
32843 Owned by a serious, James Beard nominee, this is high taste, funky fun for killer Mexican food.
32844 We sat at the bar, and joked with the cool bartenders for a while; all the time trying a myriad of different tacos.
32845 Every single one was great!
32846 This is the real deal, with a creative edge.
32847 I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night.
32848 When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were.
32849 I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait.
32850 However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated.
32851 I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, "not too long."
32852 We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began.
32853 Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo).
32854 So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours.
32855 After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order.
32856 Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out.
32857 Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out.
32858 And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce.
32859 We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out.
32860 So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait.
32861 Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time.
32862 I don't recommend going to Macayos.
32863 You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.
32864 If I could give zero stars, I would.
32865 Just about the worst experience for my friend and I.
32866 We came in for a quick and easy dinner.
32867 After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.
32868 First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back.
32869 Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving.
32870 I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone.
32871 They're lazy, slow, and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.
32872 The happy hour prices are great, but there are other RA's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location.
32873 Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had!
32874 The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.
32875 They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.
32876 I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime.
32877 Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had.
32878 When I need a mid day sugar rush...
32879 I'll be back!
32880 Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruth's Chris steakhouse.
32881 Comes to your table sizzling hot.
32882 Sides are sold individually but are pretty good.
32883 The deserts and appetizers are awesome.
32884 Being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet.
32885 If you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it.
32886 The last time I was at The Vig, they tricked me.. You see, they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out, and sometimes, when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo, they close them on you, so like an asshole, you attempt to walk back outside the way you came, but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people.
32887 Be mindful of this.
32888 But hey, at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow.
32889 And then I hid in the bocce ball pit for the remainder of the evening where I somehow acquired 200 bruises.
32890 I love the Vig.
32891 Even when I'm embarrassing the shit out of myself.
32892 I'm so happy this store is located so close to my house!
32893 Every time I come to this store I get great service.
32894 I mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon - where Zombi has never had a bad experience.
32895 This location also has a Banfield Vet Hospital, PetsHotel, Doggie Day Camp, Training services and at times has adoptions.
32896 My best friend has used both the PetsHotel and the Doggie Day Camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience.
32897 I also used the Banfield Vet to get Zombi up-to-date on her Rabies and the Vet was super nice.
32898 The best part was that I didn't even have an appointment, I just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait.
32899 My only pet peeve (pun intended) is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long.
32900 However, it doesn't take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the check-out experience AND they usually show up on their own, without customers complaining about only having one cashier.
32901 Bonus!
32902 I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food!
32903 My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong!
32904 The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix!
32905 When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool!
32906 We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers.
32907 I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree.
32908 I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future.
32909 I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill.
32910 It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend!
32911 I'll be back next time I'm in the area.
32912 This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix.
32913 I've never had better pho than here.
32914 I usually order the "spicy beef sate" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho.
32915 My family and I also order the pork "spicy treats" which is a roll-your-own spring roll.
32916 It's delicious and fun!
32917 One order feeds all five of us.
32918 The owner is also extremely nice.
32919 They also offer discounts to ASU students!
32920 Have to love that.
32921 Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly.
32922 And i informed the manager of it as well.
32923 I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail.
32924 The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad.
32925 But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep.
32926 I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say.
32927 But the Train noise is just unbearable.
32928 I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable.
32929 Stay Elsewhere.
32930 I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.
32931 I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place.
32932 Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a "sorry" from the staff.
32933 I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out.
32934 The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, "okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there."
32935 Seriously?
32936 You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell?
32937 After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side.
32938 Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.
32939 I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now I'm warning all of Yelp.
32940 It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink, but the awful service made it clear that's not the case and I shudder to think of what new low they'll sink to.
32941 Love this place.
32942 Friendly staff.
32943 Always a treat to see what's cooking on the weekend.
32944 I don't mind standing in line to order.
32945 Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones.
32946 Ask Kiersten about the cortadito.
32947 Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter.
32948 I love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit.
32949 The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.
32950 Once you feel good about the healthy choices you've made you encounter the cookie section at the register.
32951 All I'm going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for!!
32952 The chocolate chips just melt in your hands!!
32953 Doesn't get any better than that!
32954 !
32955 Paradise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit.
32956 Put Paradise Bakery on your "always good" list!
32957 !
32958 Some of the best Italian food I have ever had.
32959 This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting.
32960 The bar is small but fun to hang out at.
32961 The food is always fresh and delicious.
32962 Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles.
32963 True Mexican street fare - at first a little intimidating for this Gringa, but it was awesome.
32964 The owner Dan (who happens to be a Culinary Institute trained chef) put together a variety pack for us.
32965 Everything is small and cheap, so you can get a whole bunch of different stuff to try.
32966 $30 fed 5 people.
32967 On the NE corner of 19th Ave & Glendale, next to 7-11.
32968 Give 'em a try - you won't be disappointed!
32969 I had lunch at Lon's and wow, what a great experience.
32970 Great food, great service and great ambiance outside.
32971 I met the Chef at an event and he was less than friendly.
32972 Maybe he was having a bad day?
32973 His unfriendliness aside, this is a must try if you are  in the area.
32974 I love this place!
32975 Been to a few different locations and the pizza is always excellent.
32976 Yesterday, my boyfriend stopped by the Camelback and 10th St. location and picked up pizzas to take home (he called in advance, as the pan pizza takes at least 30 min).
32977 I had a veggie, tomato, basil, garlic, and he had a meat combo-pepp and sausage.
32978 So delicious.
32979 The only complaint he had was the parking situation there.
32980 It is kind of tough, but well worth it.
32981 I absolutely recommend Oregano's!
32982 I was really disgusted with this place.
32983 I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 12:30 PM and there was no one (not exagerating)  there.
32984 But we were hungry and hot so we stayed.
32985 I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MAR...just frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it.
32986 It's breaded and precut...couldn't they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasn't completely processed?
32987 The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didn't like at all.
32988 My husband's chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria.
32989 The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid.
32990 I think they let the tea bags go bad or something.
32991 Gross and how annoying that they  don't have seafood.
32992 Wahoo tacos from La Jolla please come here to AZ!!
32993 !
32994 What a restaurant!
32995 Absolutely loved my experience at Tarbells.
32996 I've been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently.
32997 My party and I sat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable, rather large and really social and fun.
32998 The bartender (young woman) was fabulous, inviting and very nice!
32999 She was very attentive.
33000 A guest in my party dines at Tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar.....Now thats some customer service for ya!
33001 Food = We started with the Calamari.
33002 A favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding.
33003 Two very different but delicious dipping sauces.
33004 A roasted red pepper and a pesto mix.
33005 Not sure which one I liked more :) I enjoyed the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops.
33006 TO DIE FOR.
33007 I am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right.
33008 Caramelized, giving them the right amount a sweet....and it was served over very yummy risotto.
33009 Another dish enjoyed by my party was the Fennel Sausage Pasta dish, the fennel sausage was AMAZING.
33010 Overall experience was fantastic, as soon as I get another opportunity I will be dining here again!
33011 :)
33012 NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.
33013 She rules!
33014 She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.
33015 It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!
33016 ): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.
33017 They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.
33018 In the center is a PILE (a total monton!)
33019 of grilled chicken.
33020 It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.
33021 It had been marinated, too.
33022 And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.
33023 It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!
33024 I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.
33025 This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.
33026 I have made a mess in my "Make me Yelp" boyshorts.
33027 I live in LA where these shops are on every corner.
33028 I can say without a doubt, this is the best FroYo I've had!
33029 On top of that, the store staff is super-friendly and the place is immaculately clean.
33030 They are also serving gelato, pastries and fresh coffee/espresso.
33031 Check it out!
33032 will review after I eat.
33033 Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate, sesame chicken (YUM) and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork.
33034 This was really really  good food.
33035 Good prices.
33036 When we are in the area we will definitely go back.
33037 This is a good store for your beauty needs.
33038 They are open until 8pm too which is nice.
33039 Wow.
33040 I'm not even going to wait until I'm done before leaving a review.
33041 I just placed my order, 30 minutes after sitting down.
33042 11:35 - Sit at a table for 8 an order drinks.
33043 So far so good.
33044 11:39 - Things were going alright when we had a table of 8, but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give Floridino's some money in return for a quick lunch, all hell broke loose.
33045 11:41 - There was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables.
33046 "You can't sit in there.
33047 We don't have a server in there."
33048 Screw it, we picked up our drinks and moved in.
33049 If they can serve us at that table, they can serve us one table over in this other room.
33050 11:45 - We asked to see the manager.
33051 11:50 - "We can get you drinks in here, but not food.
33052 We have to wait for a table to open up out there.
33053 Then we can serve you."
33054 11:52 - Someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves.
33055 We still haven't spoken to a manager...
33056 11:55 - "We don't want to overwhelm the kitchen."
33057 (Hmm..
33058 If you didn't want to "overwhelm" the kitchen, maybe you should have taken my order 20+ minutes ago...)
33059 12:05 - They're taking our food orders in the Forbidden Room.
33060 I guess they're not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe.
33061 12:32 - Just received my food in the Forbidden Room.
33062 Pretty much exactly an hour after I got here.
33063 You suck, Floridino's.
33064 Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation.
33065 They've got the best hot dog sleeve.
33066 It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and it's not messy.
33067 Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries.
33068 Healing hands!
33069 A dedicated, professional  therapist/intricate bodyworker who listens to your needs to develope an individualized treatment.
33070 Focused in addressing  my health concerns and goals.
33071 A message like no other that left me  feeling restored with the added bonus of "spot on" nutritional advise ... an overall concern for your good health!
33072 To feel renewed ... highly recommended!!!!!!!
33073 !
33074 I go there often.
33075 Love the food.
33076 Love the atmosphere.
33077 Great beers & usually great service
33078 Went to Sol for restaurant week.
33079 Was less than impressed with the bitter salad with MIA avocados, the carnitas that were very bland and boring, the rice was delicious, however the black beans tasted like aspirin, dessert was a dulche flan that was hard, solid and icky.
33080 Service was average, took 2 hours to get thru dinner.
33081 Best part was the refreshing wine and beer!
33082 Cheers to SOL, we wont be returning.
33083 Had a wonderful birthday dinner at CIBO last night.
33084 This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant, and now is the time to YELP.
33085 CIBO has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds!
33086 Fun to make your own brushettas....
33087 My husband and I shared the Rustica delightful, delicious, delectable....
33088 And the creps...what can I say...I didn't need it, but I wanted it, so I had it, so there!
33089 Fresca creps with fruit, vanilla ice cream and fresh whip....Mmmm...food coma.
33090 Lovely service and birthday!
33091 I was surprised by the depth and distinctness of the olive oil.
33092 I was expecting oiliness with hints of flavor, but instead was pleasantly surprised by bold flavors carried on an already flavorful oil.
33093 This place far outshines other oil stores which add flavor essence to their oil.
33094 They infuse the flavors here, making them stronger and more authentic.
33095 Overall, great oil and balsamic vinegar.
33096 Try their food, such as the sandwiches.
33097 And definitely try as many oil samples as you can.
33098 The oil is not too expensive, ~$20 per bottle.
33099 Well worth it if you like to use it on bread or to add some great flavor to a salad.
33100 Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.
33101 Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.
33102 They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck.
33103 The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm.
33104 I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling.
33105 Great service, atmosphere and of course great food.
33106 My wife and I decided on Blue 32 last night for dinner.
33107 We have been there many times, but we felt we needed to share our experience.
33108 We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons.
33109 Around 9:50 we realized the kitchen would be closing.
33110 I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served "dinners" of course he stated 10:00pm "OOPS".
33111 But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted.
33112 I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first.
33113 We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up.
33114 Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill, but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted.
33115 At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything.
33116 But a moment later, Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted.
33117 Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late, but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing.
33118 So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time, a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it.
33119 SOOOOO....we would highly recommend Blue 32 and it's staff including by name, Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders.
33120 Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience, this place is a must!!
33121 !
33122 I would not recommend this place to anyone.
33123 I went there looking for a gift.
33124 I received no help.
33125 The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.
33126 I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store.
33127 Also, they did not have a very good selection of items.
33128 I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers.
33129 I took my computer to RedSeven recently when my friends were calling and telling me I had a nasty virus that was sending out gobs of email every fifteen mins.
33130 I had no idea my computer was infected.
33131 I was hesitant to do so because I needed my computer to do some work.
33132 No worries, the fellas over at RedSeven hooked me up with a loaner.
33133 I was able to get online and get my work done and get my home PC back the next day without missing a beat.
33134 I was going to take my computer to one of those BIG BOX store repair places.
33135 I am so glad I didnt.
33136 A friend of mine took their PC there and when it came back all of their family pictures, music and email was gone.
33137 I will only be using RedSeven in the future and I suggest you do the same.
33138 I have to admit, I normally don't like Chinese food.
33139 In fact, it's just about the only style of food I haven't fallen in love with at some point in my life.
33140 This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night.
33141 I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express.
33142 It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!
33143 It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED!
33144 Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.
33145 I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages.
33146 Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare.
33147 Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far.
33148 Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb.
33149 The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food.
33150 They'll be quick to recommend something if you're having a hard time deciding.
33151 Just ask!
33152 Like Sex or Tobacco?
33153 Hells yeah!!!!
33154 were not looking for vanilla yes' here, this place pulls out all the stops
33155 If  Ichi Yakaguru the new york club promoter and 9yo Japanese pimp needed anything, it could be found here.
33156 The best selection of DVD's and printed material i have come by in awhile... lots of Toys so much stuff a lot of it is hung above the head, so look up.
33157 Lingerie, Tobacco, Human Fire Hydrants, Hobos with Soap Sud Beards
33158 Been here twice now and wish I could say more.
33159 The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great.
33160 A great place to take an out of town guest.
33161 Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend.
33162 My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish.
33163 Definitely check this place out!
33164 !
33165 Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls.
33166 The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive.
33167 The strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck.
33168 Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else.
33169 Even if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it.
33170 Five stars.
33171 Places don't get much better.
33172 I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.
33173 I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.
33174 When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.
33175 Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.
33176 I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple "Hello", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.
33177 When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say "Bye".
33178 I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.
33179 I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist.
33180 I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.
33181 I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location.
33182 Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didn't acknowledge us.
33183 Had to repeat order several times.
33184 It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock, no philly cheese steak nor soup was available.
33185 I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable, condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked).
33186 Felt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place.
33187 Will not go back.
33188 Dear Lo-Lo's why do you have to be so damn good!?
33189 I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldn't have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again... but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouth-watering juicy breasts & thighs... Woah where is this going?!
33190 LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work....
33191 Truly wonderful...
33192 I never had waffles with fried chicken before and I'm not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS!
33193 ;-) I love you Lo-lo's!
33194 I have completed this run (obviously not the 27th annual edition) 5 times now.
33195 The course is always the same - a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo, but the organization is always excellent.
33196 The t-shirt is another good draw to this event - a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun.
33197 There is always food at the end, a raffle, and a great crowd.
33198 One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right!
33199 This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix.
33200 This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service.
33201 Noca is an experience.
33202 I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie.
33203 I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!
33204 On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird.
33205 It's so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives.
33206 Sold!
33207 I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad.
33208 Lay off me when there's bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister!
33209 First up was the mixed salad.
33210 I love how it's not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit.
33211 It's the perfect balance of flavors.
33212 We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly.
33213 I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops.
33214 The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous.
33215 The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime.
33216 Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name.
33217 I just smiled.
33218 I found this place based on Yelp reviews so I feel obligated to add one more 5 star review to the mix.
33219 I needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself.
33220 So I stopped by and had them take a look at it.
33221 They recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair.
33222 I ended up passing but didn't feel like they were trying to take advantage of me.
33223 Since it was close to closing time I left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup.
33224 It has been as good as new ever since.
33225 Having my fair share of riding in the Valley of the Sun I'm sure I'll be back soon for some inter-tubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike I happen to be riding around at the time.
33226 Protip: Check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place.
33227 Also they have a small BMX (?)
33228 track in their "backyard" you can ride around and do jumps on anytime.
33229 I had such a great time at this place both times i went.
33230 The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister.
33231 The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.
33232 Once i walked in my excitement grew.
33233 The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.
33234 Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.
33235 We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.
33236 They even had Uni!
33237 i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.
33238 Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.
33239 Their yellowfin was just amazing!
33240 My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.
33241 I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.
33242 This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect.
33243 Wedge salad is delish!
33244 Love the fact that it's organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating "regular" pizza.
33245 I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!
33246 Parents, please let ur children explore on their own!
33247 I c parents following their kids around !
33248 Originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family!
33249 They have everything here for cats, dogs, small birds, rabbits, poultry, horses and more!
33250 The customer service was excellent, we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well.
33251 Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us, not about making a sale, and will even special order some products for us if ever needed.
33252 We don't feed our dogs dry food anymore (they now eat raw instead), but when we did, these are the premium/healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers.
33253 The prices are low, the hours are convenient, the customer service was great, the products are healthy, and the selection was large for how small the shop is, what more could you ask for?
33254 Great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again!
33255 Everything I have tried here is awesome!
33256 You can't go wrong with your choices!
33257 Service is ok. Could be better.
33258 Not very personable!
33259 If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.
33260 But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.
33261 It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.
33262 Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.
33263 I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.
33264 So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.
33265 How does this make any sense.
33266 To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote "family style".
33267 Since when did sushi get served family style?
33268 Here is the problem.
33269 Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served "family style" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.
33270 We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!
33271 When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was "this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties".
33272 This is absurd.
33273 So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.
33274 How could you know with that many people ordering????
33275 I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.
33276 So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?
33277 I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.
33278 If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.
33279 They said someone was told when the reservation was made.
33280 The reservation was made for 25 people!
33281 It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.
33282 Worst experience ever!
33283 I went here on a Saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background.
33284 It was part of the Music Under the Stars, or whatever it called, very cool and fun though.
33285 BTW, I see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was, to all you yelpers, take that with a grain of salt, it's a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend, what do you expect, I guess it's an expectation thing.
33286 By no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two.
33287 It's a classy, family oriented pizza place.
33288 We ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza.
33289 Very well priced, and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious.
33290 It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is, and I guess I have a weird opinion as well.
33291 Here goes...the size of the small, is not small it was more like a medium (value!
33292 winning!
33293 )(sorry lame Charlie Sheen pop culture reference) anyway, it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like, the cheese was good, not too much sauce, and the pepperonis were very flavorful.
33294 They were the small kind and they were just great.
33295 The Salad was good, salad is salad, it's hard to mess that up.
33296 We were helped by an awesome bartender/server named Chandler.
33297 Cool guy, really nice, he kept us entertained.
33298 We'll be back I want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there.
33299 There's a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream.
33300 It's soft, creamy, and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer.
33301 Growing up in Arizona, we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if you've never experienced homemade ice cream, just go to Churn.
33302 I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top.
33303 I can't say anything bad about it at all.
33304 If someone doesn't like their ice cream, it's because they've been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains.
33305 The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia.
33306 I'll tell you what sounds like the best day ever:  riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day... stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break (and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail).
33307 Top notch.
33308 He is now my go to barber.
33309 Charged only $16 for cut and beard trim, but I throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut.
33310 He will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for.
33311 Can't go wrong with this guy.
33312 And what a cool place!
33313 By far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Arizona!
33314 The service is always awesome, the place is always clean, and the environment is always welcoming and friendly.
33315 I love hole in the wall, family-owned restaurants because [at least the ones I have been to] there is always a sense of pride in their service and their food.
33316 I've been to this restaurant a few times and have loved everything I have tried.
33317 I like being able to taste flavor, not seasoning, and their Dolmeh appetizer is just that: a perfect medley of herbs, grape leaves, and rice.
33318 I usually order the #6 - Beef Kebab, but I have tried their #3 - Chicken and Gyros and #7 - Lamb Kebab.
33319 The meat, be it beef, chicken, lamb, or gyro, is always moist and tender.
33320 Like their meat, the grilled vegetables have a perfect blend of crispy and lightly seared on the outside, but juicy and steamed on the inside.
33321 The basmati rice is always thoroughly cooked and flavorful.
33322 The same goes for the Homous, Baba Ganoosh, and Yogurt Cucumber Dip.
33323 I highly recommend their house Combination Platter.
33324 The pitas are always warm and their homous and ganoosh have the perfect texture.
33325 Try to go around 5p to beat the dinner rush.
33326 The place is always packed on Saturday nights, so show up a little before regular dinner time if you want to ensure seating for your party!
33327 i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressing-drenched paper that held my very first, and surely not last, lucky boy international burger.
33328 crispy bun, tons of dressing, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions, and a perfectly tender, smokey burger.
33329 thick, perfectly salted, crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries.
33330 thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake.
33331 gone.
33332 in less than 5 minutes.
33333 place closes early, so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru.
33334 This is a GREAT place to eat!
33335 One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos "Lunch With Stew".
33336 My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.
33337 mmmmm, mmm.
33338 Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour.
33339 Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar.
33340 Amazing sandwhich joint.
33341 A must go place to eat!
33342 5 stars all the way.
33343 Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the products.
33344 The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door.
33345 I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here.
33346 I'm completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I can't get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
33347 So now that we've established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff.
33348 I've never seen anything like it.
33349 If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink.
33350 Leila is the best at this.
33351 She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive.
33352 She'll see a regular customer's car pull up and she'll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door.
33353 THAT is the epitome of customer service.
33354 Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll.
33355 This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.
33356 You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign.
33357 Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer.
33358 Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops.
33359 You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.
33360 It's OK, but beware.
33361 Unagi and other "hot" items have a "beep-beep beep-beep" before they get to you.
33362 California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise.
33363 Rice is not right either.
33364 Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.
33365 If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake.
33366 Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.
33367 And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse.
33368 It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's.
33369 Stay in the courtyard recently and have no complaints at all!!
33370 RIght when I entered the place , the staff greeted us and they were all very nice and helpful with everything.
33371 Although i only stayed there for 1 night , i thought the rooms were very well kept and the bed was amazing!
33372 The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing!
33373 The rooms are about normal size and has a tv , desk , chair , etc..... Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here.
33374 Wifi was fast and easily available.
33375 Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one.
33376 Overall , i would stay here again if i come by Phoenix!
33377 !
33378 I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.
33379 So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.
33380 She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012.
33381 Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients.
33382 I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me.
33383 As usual Jo was absolutely amazing.
33384 He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go).
33385 He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.
33386 And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings.
33387 They still look amazing a week later.
33388 I'm still in love, and they are perfectly healthy.
33389 Job well done.
33390 But I'm not surprised.
33391 part of a social event, we only had app's here.
33392 quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce.
33393 the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal.
33394 i was slightly full afterwards.
33395 part of the roaring fork, wildfish franchise, they also offer a great happy hour.
33396 seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of, so i'd save this (for the middle class foodie) for a special event.
33397 Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party.
33398 We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day.
33399 This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible.
33400 We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two.
33401 I had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM!
33402 The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked.
33403 My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.
33404 Great value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn).
33405 If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait.
33406 Busy place, but everyone is nice and I keep having to go to the cell lot because of late baggage from my original destination.
33407 They charge a lot to deliver so better get your bags checked 45 mn early...
33408 We love Dr Steve!
33409 This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need.
33410 Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here.
33411 They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if you're looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from.
33412 I love how clean and perfect this mall is!
33413 This is a great Radio Shack.
33414 The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.
33415 If you need odd batteries, check this store out first.
33416 I needed a watch battery, and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it.
33417 It cost be all of $5 bucks, but saved me having to buy a new watch.
33418 Not only does this place get it's ingredients directly from Italy, it makes a variety of flavors fresh, daily!
33419 I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back.
33420 I've tried other gelato spots around the U.S, but nothing has caught my AMORE, or the authentic Italian flavor, more than Angel Sweet.
33421 So far my favorite combo is the "most popular" Panna Cotta with Banana, (which an employee recommended), Hazelnut and Pistachio, as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again, with the Panna Cotta.
33422 Don't forget your punch card, buy 12, and get one kid's size free!
33423 I LOVE LIFE TIME!!
33424 It's always clean  plenty of machines to work out  on  that are in working order!
33425 HUGH VARIETY  of classes to take and keep you from getting bored.
33426 My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym.
33427 They also have the rock climbing wall, basketball and Squash courts and outdoor and indoor pool with life guard and a water slide at both.
33428 The out doors  and indoors have a lap pool as well .
33429 The inside has 2 extra large jacuzzi  and of course your steam room and saunas.
33430 I personally love the locker rooms they are so nice to shower and get ready in they provide everything you could think of ( just like a 5 star hotel!! )
33431 This place keeps me motivated You Gotta try the Zumba class and Strictly strength class!!
33432 !
33433 My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California.
33434 We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.
33435 My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries.
33436 The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders.
33437 My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese.
33438 The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted.
33439 I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife.
33440 I have recommended RnR in the past.
33441 I do not think I will in the future.
33442 For those of you who love Indian/Pakistani food, but hate dives, Z-Grill just may turn your whole world upside down.
33443 In all foodie honesty, Z-Grill is home to some of the best Indo-Pak food I've ever had.
33444 This praise comes with a reminder though...it is divey.
33445 Z-Grill is located inside Zam Zam World Market, which is a decent little grocery, but it lacks the umph that other well-known ethnic groceries delivery.
33446 With that being said though, other groceries lack Z-Grill, and this is why it matters...
33447 Everything I've tried from the restaurant, and I mean everything thus far, delivers.
33448 From the hummus, to the samosas, to the chana and even to the paneer masala and chicken karahi, I've only been disappointed when I realized that I was down to the last bite.
33449 The flavors are robust, the sauces are spicy and, surprisingly, the prices are unbelievably reasonable.
33450 It's safe to say that I'm addicted to this place.
33451 **A word of caution when trying Z-Grill.
33452 They are sometimes out of items on the menu.
33453 I find that charming cause they have to make everything from scratch, others might not.
33454 If they happen to be out of something, do yourself a favor and just try something else.
33455 **
33456 I cannot say enough good things about the food from Z-Grill.
33457 This is a must-try in the valley for anyone who has a love for spicy Indo-Pak food.
33458 Go try it!
33459 EXCELLENT TRIP TO THE SPA!!!!
33460 !
33461 A trip to the Aji Spa (located at the Sheraton Wildhorse Pass Resort and Spa) was at the top of my list during my recent trip to Arizona on Memorial Day Weekend.
33462 We made our reservations well in advance.
33463 Having gone to a few spa resorts, I couldn't wait to pay this one a visit.
33464 My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package, which was comprised of 2 services each.
33465 We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa.
33466 After changing in the women's locker room, and relaxing in the private women's lounge area (there's a large lounge area, but it's co-ed), our masseuses met us and brought us into our room.
33467 My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage.
33468 After only having solo massages, I was interested how a companion massage differed.
33469 The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by.
33470 My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable, relaxing and beneficial.
33471 After our massages were completed, we had some time in between our next service, feeling a little hungry, we decided to grab some lunch from the spa's cafe.
33472 I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR!
33473 Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli, grilled chicken pieces, pesto sauce, marinated bell peppers, melted cheese and avocado.
33474 My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory, a little fuzzy, but that was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!
33475 !
33476 After lunch sometime, we each were up for our second service, our facials!!!
33477 Due to my skin type, I received the Aji Rain Facial.
33478 My esthetician was wonderful!
33479 Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure.
33480 I left that room with my face feeling renewed, clean and fresh!
33481 All spa treatments include full use of the spa's facilities so we definitely made well use of that!
33482 After our facials, we used the sauna (the steam room was out of service during our visit) and whirlpools located on the women's locker side.
33483 We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool.
33484 The Aji Spa is such a calm, warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap!
33485 Outside!
33486 In desert heat!
33487 Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade!
33488 The staff at the spa provided excellent service!
33489 From the front desk, to our masseuse, the esthetician, the cafe staff and the locker room attendant!
33490 While napping, one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it!
33491 Our appointment started at 12pm and with our 2 procedures, and lunch, we should have been done and out of there within a few hours.
33492 But the point of visiting the spa was to relax, and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place, we just didn't want to leave!
33493 We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival, and we would have stayed longer if we could!
33494 I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area, or if you're looking for a new spa to travel to!
33495 Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service.
33496 They even emailed me the same day of my service as a "Thank You" for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit!
33497 A 5-star spa, indeed!
33498 The french toast was delicious!
33499 Toddy was especially good
33500 This place is awesome.
33501 Affordable, tasty food.
33502 Simple and clean country environment.
33503 Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm!
33504 Half price appetizers and good drink prices.
33505 I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.
33506 And pretty much everything I've had there is good.
33507 I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing.
33508 It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too.
33509 Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience.
33510 The restaurant was very clean, the service was great.
33511 The best part?
33512 The food.
33513 I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)
33514 I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra.
33515 First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch.
33516 The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy.
33517 The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist.
33518 And the okra was fantastic, too.
33519 It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either.
33520 I will be back.
33521 a lot :)
33522 The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it.
33523 We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess.
33524 They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!)
33525 but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain.
33526 The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.
33527 Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected.
33528 Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property.
33529 It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost.
33530 At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up.
33531 It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there.
33532 But we had fun wandering around the "town" and taking goofy pictures of each other.
33533 Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool.
33534 The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days.
33535 They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool.
33536 There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.
33537 We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita's Kitchen and both were fantastic.
33538 We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!
33539 Yes, the place is busy every time I go there, and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your order
33540 Yes, the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeover
33541 Yes, the location is...ummm...well lets just say its a "working class neighborhood"
33542 BUT they've got the best fish tacos I've ever had, and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding.
33543 The $1 tacos are "mini-tacos" so get 3 or 4 of them, a couple of fish tacos, maybe a side of rice and/or beans and you will be all set.
33544 Go there.
33545 Just leave yourself plenty of time, it's well worth the wait.
33546 Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent.
33547 They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream.
33548 Mmmmm.
33549 Yummy.
33550 The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice, as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo.
33551 Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good, too.
33552 Overall, everything tastes great because it's made fresh.
33553 No pre-packaged items here.
33554 Seating--Lots of booths and tables inside and out.
33555 They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be 'lounge' chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect, for savoring your beverage of choice.
33556 The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people, if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is '311'.
33557 Peak times--avoid lunchtime during the weekdays.
33558 It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soup/salad special from PB during 11-1PM.
33559 The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time, food prep & consumption.
33560 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
33561 The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast.
33562 I've been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday.
33563 During these times, I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table.
33564 Free stuff--this would include WiFi, bread samples with tasty spreads, muffin and/or cookie bits.
33565 Bonus points for free stuff!
33566 PB is open Mon-Sat 7AM-9PM and Sun 7AM-6PM.
33567 Awesome!
33568 I highly recommend this place!
33569 Incredible atmosphere inside and out, the bar design is superb and the patio is the perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying drinks with friends.
33570 I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review.
33571 The menu is innovative and fresh!
33572 The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise.
33573 Plus, you can't beat their happy hour seven days a week!
33574  I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich, which were both out of this world!
33575 Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I can't wait to go back and try all the others.
33576 The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus!
33577 As a parent, I love that this place is a perfect day/night out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along!
33578 Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal!
33579 The design is spot on for this area!
33580 Great job!
33581 Thomas was very welcoming and a great server/bartender.
33582 Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date.
33583 My lady and i's date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated.
33584 Kudos Thomas and citizen!
33585 Dr. Ken Danyluk and his team offer an Extraordinary Orthodontic experience.
33586 Team Orthodonitcs offers many Orthodontic soluitions for all ages.
33587 Whether patients choose traditional braces, Invisalign or "Hidden Brace" lingual braces behind their teeth, they always leave happy!
33588 Let's start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans, went to school in Lafayette (home of the Ragin Cajuns), and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food.
33589 I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldn't consider eating any of these if not well prepared.
33590 That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY.
33591 The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, that's DAMN GOOD.
33592 Frankly, I've never had better.
33593 The only thing that is not "as good as it gets" is the red beans and rice.
33594 They're good, but not quite the creamy "Washday Monday" staple that I grew up on.
33595 My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much.
33596 But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy.
33597 Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all.
33598 But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille.
33599 Simply put, I've never had better sausage--ever.
33600 It's the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever.
33601 I've eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town.
33602 Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later.
33603 I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana).
33604 As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall.
33605 At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live.
33606 If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana.
33607 For me, it's just like a visit to any of my favorite po-boy shops in the old neighborhoods.
33608 It really is that good.
33609 great sports bar.
33610 TV's galore.
33611 Good food.
33612 Outside patio.
33613 While many places claim to be sports bars, for some reason they wind up not paying attention to the TV's and wind up with hair removal infomercials playing.
33614 This place knows what they are doing with the tv's.
33615 I was watching the manager who looked like had a spreadsheet with every game planned out and on what tv's.
33616 They also play the sound from the premier game.
33617 Probably the best mall I've ever been to.
33618 Anchored by five mega stores - Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, Macy's, Dillards and Barneys New York.
33619 It's so big, it took a couple of hours just to walk it.
33620 My wife called it the best mall she's ever been too.
33621 Nuff said.
33622 My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.
33623 A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.
33624 I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.
33625 30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.
33626 Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.
33627 I called my wife, she cancelled.
33628 Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.
33629 WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.
33630 I have tried finding a spin class in Arizona that is of the intensity and variety that this studio offers.
33631 Bar none.
33632 The CoreBalance Studio has dedicated instructors that push you to your limit in an encouraging way.
33633 The unique thing about this studio is they use the "RealRider" (or is it "RealRyder"?)
33634 bikes that cause you to turn right and left to work your obliques.
33635 Outstanding workout!
33636 I recommend it to everyone who wants to get into shape.
33637 This is another one of those restaurants I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp.
33638 San Diego Bay Restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on the main drag in Guadalupe.
33639 It's taken me a long time to review this place.
33640 The first time I went was over two years ago and I've been back a few times.
33641 I have to admit, I've never had better Mexican seafood.
33642 Unfortunately since it's been awhile, I've forgotten what I ordered.
33643 I can tell you this though, every dish has been superb.
33644 Each bite was like heaven.
33645 I left wanting to try everything on the menu.
33646 The servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and I've taken many people here, much to their delight.
33647 They've all raved about it.
33648 Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen is a gem in the many pizza locations that can be found in the Phoenix area.
33649 Picazzo's boasts a menu which includes appetizers, salads, organic and gluten-free pastas, and of course pizza and dessert!
33650 One cannot go wrong with any of the categories of foods Picazzo's offers, but there are certainly favorites that can be ordered upon ones first visit.
33651 Picazzo's offers a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere upon entering their establishment.
33652 One is greeted immediately by their hostess at the door and then you are seated promptly at one of their many tables (or the bar area if you prefer).
33653 The atmosphere is roomy with their ample seating, and friendly upon entering.
33654 One of their best appetizers is their Mama's Meat-za Balls ($9.50).
33655 Made with three meatballs with mozzarella, artichoke hearts, organic tomato sauce, basil, and Parmesan, it is a savory appetizer that easy starts the meal off on the right foot.
33656 One can choose from one of their many pasta dishes or their pizza creations, or even create your own creation.
33657 If going with one of their creations, I would recommend their "Nonna's Favorite" (gluten free) ($16.50, $21.00, $25.00).
33658 This pizza is a delicious combination of organic olive oil and garlic, Fontina and mozzarella cheeses, mushrooms, tomatoes, goat cheese, Kalamata olives, and basil.
33659 Melts right in your mouth and one can easy eat more than one expected!
33660 If even after all of this you still crave something sweet - One cannot go wrong with electing their "Classic Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie" ($7.00).
33661 This sinful combination includes two scoops of organic vanilla bean or coconut vanilla ice cream served with your choice of organic chocolate, chocolate mint, or chocolate raspberry sauce over a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie.
33662 Oh wondrous dessert indeed!
33663 Picazzo's will leave you most satisfied and delighted with all that is good.
33664 With the finest ingredients, Picazzo's takes great care in delivering the best in atmosphere and dish.
33665 Stop by Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen today for an unforgettable meal.
33666 What can I say about this place?
33667 I love it.
33668 Its straight up the road from my place.
33669 You can find everything here, not just Asian food.
33670 When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go.
33671 I love LOVE their meat counter.
33672 I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want.
33673 The fish fry service is nice.
33674 They have stuff I can't live without and can't find anywhere else i.e.
33675 aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks.
33676 The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod.
33677 And a little known secret?
33678 The vegetables are freshest on Fridays.
33679 I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale.
33680 Well something has changed...
33681 I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help.
33682 They were all too busy talking with one another.
33683 And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs....
33684 I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.
33685 I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.
33686 I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers.
33687 It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close.
33688  Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place.
33689   I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables.
33690  Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken.
33691 Usually, unless there's an attempt at "chefing" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.
33692 Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.
33693 It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating.
33694 We were in AZ visiting out for Thanksgiving and really wanted so go AZ mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some Margaritas.
33695 This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try.
33696 The food was pretty good.
33697 My son had a cheese crisp, wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco, Mother-in-law had pork tamales, and I had the beef green chile.
33698 They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa (which we eat too much of!).
33699 Everything was pretty good, but the margaritas were really good.
33700 I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint.
33701 I think they should advertise them more because they are so good.
33702 Very fresh tasting!
33703 Next time we go back to AZ we will definitely visit again.
33704 This place is perfect!
33705 Great food, great service and friendly people.
33706 We will be back over and over again!
33707 We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent (Stetson chopped salad, scallops, testosterone salad).
33708 Lovvvve it!
33709 I had a great dinner there.
33710 One of my best in a long time.
33711 It was sucha treat.
33712 Once in a while you have to take care of yourself and just enjoy what life has to offer.
33713 Chef Juan was great to talk to.
33714 Seems this guy has been there sinsr they broke ground.
33715 If you truely like yourself take a walk around the grounds after dinner and smoke a cigar at the big Fire Pit or over by the dock.
33716 Life is good.
33717 Love it!
33718 Closest thing in Tempe to the food we actually had in Thailand.
33719 Love this place !
33720 Food is spicy and always cooked just right.
33721 Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too.
33722 Service is great.
33723 No matter what night you go it is busy.
33724 it is a great little find.
33725 Cibo!
33726 Cibo!
33727 Cibo!
33728 I love you and your cute old farm house, your amazing pizza, affordable wine, awesome crepe desserts, and fabulous staff!
33729 I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant!
33730 !
33731 Go to Cibo for awesome food, charming atmosphere, and a great time for a girls night or on a date.
33732 Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix!
33733 *They're closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way.
33734 La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem.
33735 It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy.
33736 Is it a quick mart?
33737 A grocery store?
33738 A restaurant?
33739 A coffee shop?
33740 Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.
33741 I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food.
33742 But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate.
33743 It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate.
33744 To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready.
33745 Unnecessary.
33746 I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO.
33747 But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos.
33748 I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.
33749 I found her on an internet deal.
33750 I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.
33751 She never returned my call till I reported her.
33752 She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.
33753 She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.
33754 I would never trust her to do my nails.
33755 Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.
33756 Thanks for the positive reinforcement talk, and explaining, I just need to take my time.
33757 Thanks Robin, you encourage me,
33758 I have been sick, and so has my family.
33759 I have missed the last couple of weeks and boy can I feel the difference.
33760 You know when miss something for a period of time??
33761 Then you have to start all over, but that o.k.
33762 Thank you again Jim and Robin for taking those few extra minutes to ask me how I am doing and how my kids are since I have been gone.
33763 Thanks so much for caring, weather its about my kids or my knees or the fact that I have a pain pump in my stomach and   have a hard time laying on my stomach, which Robin saw I was not putting full weight down on my stomach.
33764 She asked me after class what was going on and if I was O.K.
33765 She made me feel important and cared about.
33766 Where are you ever going to be working out and after class the teacher checks in with you, to make sure everything is alright.
33767 Jim and Robin Love this practice and so do I. I feel what makes them different is the caring aspect.
33768 The checking in with you.
33769 If you ever have a question, Jim and Robin will ALWAYS take the time answer questions or just see how you are doing!!!
33770 Thanks Jim and Robin!
33771 I will be back soon!!!!
33772 Thank you for being the best Bikram yoga around and thanks for just being non-judgmental, caring, and hopeful for everyone in the class to push harder and just do it the RIGHT way!!!!
33773 Love your studio, Love Robin and Jim as people!!!!!!!
33774 This is the perfect place to either start or to be challenged.
33775 Thanks, Nicole Skarderud
33776 My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years.
33777 We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date.
33778 On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner.
33779 I love the wait staff - especially Nick!
33780 His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day!
33781 For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you can't beat it.
33782 Everything is homemade and tastes fresh.
33783 #3 Yellow Curry is my hubby's favorite.
33784 Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry.
33785 The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly.
33786 I venture off and try things from time to time.
33787 The food is spicy.
33788 I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes.
33789 The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time.
33790 We always get a side order of spring rolls.
33791 You need to try these!
33792 I like the Pad Thai as well as the #5 and #7 lunch specials.
33793 Meals are served fairly quickly.
33794 Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming.
33795 Feels like I am home.
33796 If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile.
33797 Pho-k yeah .......and the spring rolls too ........
33798 Tonight at Noca Phoenix
33799 No dinner -waited 1.5 hours with no communication only to be told they were out of the fish I ordered left the restaurant 2 hrs later very hungry   Very
33800 disappointing
33801 I love Sapporo.
33802 They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...
33803 Their sushi is very good.
33804 They have fun drinks.
33805 If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.
33806 P.S.
33807 They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!
33808 !
33809 Won't be going there again.
33810 Our chicken was pink!
33811 Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.
33812 Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno.
33813 My connection was in Phoenix, and the flight from Boston was running a bit late.
33814 I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make.
33815 One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine.
33816 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board.
33817 Sorry buddy, not really fine.
33818 I missed my flight by 5 minutes.
33819 I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does.
33820 Will avoid them at ALL costs!
33821 Celebrated my anniversary here.
33822 Everything was amazing.
33823 Enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns.
33824 Luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing.
33825 He made everything perfect.
33826 He gave us our space, but at the same time entertained us when appropriate.
33827 He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster, and made sure we were well taken care.
33828 We capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine.
33829 We will definitely come back here and ask for Luis again.
33830 Very small, but wonderful food and wine.
33831 Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timo's Wine Bar).
33832 The concept of this place is killer.
33833 The Harkins Camelview 5 gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA.
33834 Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix.
33835 I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open.
33836 He certainly can't  make much money at this location.
33837 It's financially  impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate.
33838 This just shows Dan Harkin's commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ.
33839 Thanks Dan!
33840 Excellent place for a nice dinner, A classy place to bring friends for cocktails and food
33841 Went for lunch.
33842 Took over 30 min for food to arrive.
33843 Ordered chef salad.
33844 Made with processed turkey and ham.
33845 Also with processed cheese slices.
33846 childs choc milk was not mixed up.
33847 Kraft mac & cheese on kids menu.
33848 Won't come back again.
33849 I love the Valley Ho!
33850 It's a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vic's and a really nice spa.
33851 Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite.
33852 It's two stories and it's fantastic!
33853 If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho!
33854 And for all you out-of-towner's who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs, the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list!
33855 Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today...
33856 I've been to DBG a handful of times for events, exhibit openings, meetings, and of course Yelp In Bloom (a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago)... but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit.
33857 We didn't get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us, but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies.
33858 There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies, etc...
33859 The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well.
33860 We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet, which I know we will get tons of use from (only $6.25).
33861 The exhibit runs until May 13th, so don't miss it!
33862 And if you do find yourself with more time while you're there, definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well...
33863 I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool.
33864 The photography alone is worth a visit.
33865 I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often!
33866 This place is awesome.
33867 Just bought a loose super powers darkseid.
33868 Will def be back for more.
33869 Lots of loose figures.
33870 Great prices and friendly staff.
33871 This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door.
33872 Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver.
33873 It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips.
33874 Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters.
33875 The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb.
33876 Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce.
33877 The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin.
33878 The fries were piping hot, as they should be.
33879 And the portions are beyond generous.
33880 We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains.
33881 And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal.
33882 As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training.
33883 My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.
33884 He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.
33885 Love this store!
33886 I'm not a big "organic" kind of guy.
33887 I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.
33888 For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can.
33889 Having said that, I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!
33890 Service is family oriented too.
33891 They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for.
33892 As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.
33893 It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.
33894 I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.
33895 This place is that good!
33896 After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert (yeah, that's really one of the options for desert), I say that I was completely stratified with Beckett's Table.
33897 From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service.
33898 The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating.
33899 I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices!
33900 It's just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal!
33901 Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food!
33902 If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!
33903 The whole market is awesome.I like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticket.The veg are great.the free range eggs are the best.the french baker from Tucson is pretty darn good.this market is for sure one of the better ones I have seen.worth any one checking out.Note support your local produce and growers/farmers.Support Organic!!
33904 One more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from 7am to 11am
33905 The best fried chicken I have ever had
33906 pork cutlet is not to be missed either
33907 the collard greens flavor is unbelievable and purely vegetarian broth if you can belive that - absolutely no sourness
33908 I regular have to make pilgrimages for my pregnant wife here.
33909 Negative - cash only
33910 The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient.
33911 However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.
33912 So, eat in.
33913 Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.
33914 My only down note is on the service.
33915 If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees.
33916 As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.
33917 Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes).
33918 Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees.
33919 On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed.
33920 I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver.
33921 For frozen yogurt quality, I give this place a one.
33922 Honestly, it's small, there's very little variety in terms of toppings, and the yogurt tastes cheap...
33923 Probably because it's a big franchise.
33924 There is a reason why you're paying less for an ounce...
33925 Truly - you get what you pay for.
33926 The concept is neat, sure, but if you're looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini...
33927 It's just up the road from Yogurtland.
33928 Anyway, the single star says it all... "Eek!
33929 Methinks not."
33930 Ii am addicted.
33931 spectacular service and consistent, quality.
33932 food every time.
33933 i have been ordering take out and dine in for months and grimaldis does not disappoint.
33934 only once...they gave my takeout pizza to the wrong person....christine, the manager, very generously apologized, comped my new pizza, and bought me a glass of wine as i waited.
33935 grimaldis is a class act and has a fantastic staff with excellent food.
33936 every time.
33937 "Fake" (or rather condescending) service from the "Service Manager"...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE).
33938 Ended every sentence with an impolite "No ma'am" or "Yes, ma'am"... ya get the scenario.
33939 Basically, the guy was a real JERK.
33940 They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership).
33941 Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them).
33942 At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes....
33943 Obligatory stop for a drink...Dodey is here so that is always good
33944 was i ever lucky to pick dr. karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website.
33945 ever since i was a kid, i barely remember seeing my dentist.
33946 his hygienist came in, cleaned my teeth, then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth.
33947 then he left, saying only "hmmph".
33948 he had a beach house in the cayman islands.
33949 dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (don't know if he has a house in the caymans though).
33950 what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist!
33951 he does that for all his patients.
33952 i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients.
33953 how novel!
33954 he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional.
33955 he will joke and talk to you about your vacations, plans for the weekend, etc, but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care.
33956 i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness.
33957 we liked him so much, even invited him to our house warming party!
33958 so for excellent dental care and outgoing service, Dr. Karawi is your man.
33959 p.s.
33960 he's not bald, doesn't have long nose hairs or a big belly, and his breath doesn't stink.
33961 We have been meaning to try The Mission for awhile, and we were extremely impressed.
33962 We are self-professed foodies, good cooks, etc.
33963 Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!!
33964 Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner.
33965 First, the margaritas.
33966 ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them.
33967 Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them.
33968 Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into.
33969 OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as "worth it" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly.
33970 Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops.
33971 Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt.
33972 We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.
33973 Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away.
33974 The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream.
33975 Fried bananas didn't excite me either.
33976 Bananas are bananas.....
33977 The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner.
33978 I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake.
33979 At any rate, I still give them the full Monty on stars!!
33980 !
33981 My husband took me here on a Friday night ...after hearing good things about it from coworkers.
33982 We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park, it was a very relaxing environment.
33983 Our server, Carla, was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening.
33984 She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time.
33985 She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had here...thank you Carla !!
33986 !
33987 We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked, I am not sure what it was but it was damn good ($23 for the bottle).
33988 As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto, which was an assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives , and breadsticks ($14) and this is definetly enough for 2-3 people.
33989 The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also.
33990 My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubes...that was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well.
33991 For dinner we shared a pizza..
33992 The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13).
33993 It was ooh soo tasty.
33994 We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.
33995 Then we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert.
33996 It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzone
33997 filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God.
33998 This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while.
33999 It was so gratifying...I had goosebumps after the first bite.
34000 I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge ($7).
34001 I can die a happy woman after that dessert...and if this was a first date ...that would have been a guarantee for sex !!
34002 !
34003 The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing, I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear.
34004 If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood.
34005 Great surprise-- I have driven by this place several times-- food was excellent-- I had the Enchantment platter-- just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming-
34006 Cool cave-like atmosphere inside and fun patio area-- I will definitely be back and bring out of towners
34007 I love Stinkweeds.
34008 Owned by local commerce booster Kimber Lanning, Stinkweeds provides better selection and pricing than many national vendors.
34009 The staff are helpful, and if they don't have what you're looking for, they'll happily special order it for you.
34010 The parking lot is smallish, but I've never had a problem finding a space.
34011 The central location is a big plus.
34012 They share the plaza with other locally-owned businesses, so it makes for a fun shopping excursion.
34013 Their listening stations are well-stocked with a variety of music, and the staff loves to talk music, as well.
34014 They also carry a great selection of music mags, as well as some books.
34015 Have you ever walked into a bar or restaurant and instantly felt at home?
34016 That's how I felt when I walked into the Grind last night.
34017 The place has a great vibe, fantastic food and cocktails, and a friendly staff.
34018 Some of the highlights of what we ate last night...
34019 The burgers are phenomenal, the cable car drink was unusual and tasty, how could you not love donuts, and the bacon... oh the bacon...
34020 I highly recommend swinging in for lunch or dinner so it become one of your favorites as it is now one of mine.
34021 stopped here on our way home on a road trip.
34022 if i had known, i would've stopped on the way out, too.
34023 the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).
34024 the food was fantastic.
34025 boyfriend ordered "bob's big bear burger" and it was probably the biggest hamburger i've seen in person.
34026 apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).
34027 i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.
34028 And it was one of the best chocolate malts I've ever had.
34029 And the prices were reasonable.
34030 And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.
34031 Can't wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that).
34032 We ordered seabass and ribs.
34033 Both excellent choices.
34034 Service very good.
34035 Ambiance was unexpected.
34036 Felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees.
34037 Used restaurant.com coupon.
34038 Great deal.
34039 Pita Jungle is a great place to get inexpensive Mediterranean food (as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait).
34040 The food usually gets served up really fast, but then your waiter leaves and -never comes back-.
34041 I'm not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service, but I do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner.
34042 Never-the-less, the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws.
34043 Been there twice now.
34044 Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.
34045 I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?)
34046 this time.
34047 The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.
34048 I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more.
34049 super great neighborhood bookstore.
34050 it's local and not owned by the man.
34051 jimmy carter will be there signing books in febuary.
34052 They have new and used book and something is always on sale.
34053 It's attached to wild flower and next to macs.
34054 I eat there about 3 times a week!!
34055 The antipasto salad and bread are addicting and can't be beat!
34056 I've been coming here for years...the best.
34057 One of my favs is the lulu wings.
34058 This place had amazing food for reasonable prices.
34059 They have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too, it keeps you busy while you wait for your food.
34060 The bar was neat, and the atmosphere was ok.
34061 I did not enjoy the music, and it was too loud to ignore.
34062 The service was pretty good, but the waitress made my friends and I uncomfortable, like we shouldn't have been there.
34063 It might have just been that one particular girl, and I would still go back.
34064 Don't dress too casual...
34065 I had a craving for Mexican- American type food, and since there is no longer a Chi-chi's around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town.
34066 She is a frequent diner here, and loves it.
34067 I really enjoyed my experience as well.
34068 I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.
34069 So lovely!!!!
34070 I enjoyed everything on my plate!
34071  I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers.
34072 We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips.
34073 They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive.
34074 Like my friend- I would be a regular here.
34075 I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back- at my suggestion and to  her delight!
34076 Great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend.
34077 Would definitely recommend!
34078 Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley.
34079 It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good.
34080 And they're local.
34081 Can't beat it!
34082 We held a meeting planner's luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings.
34083 Our theme was "getting to the core of your meeting" and the entire event had an apple theme.
34084 Yuri's Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings.
34085 Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings, including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess.
34086 Several months ago, we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade.
34087 Yuri's created another fun flavor....lemon....that was well received by all.
34088 They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when you're on a tight budget.
34089 Thank you!
34090 I came here at noon during spring break.
34091 When I walked in, no one was there.
34092 I rang the bell on the counter.
34093 No one came out from the back.
34094 I waited and rang the bell again.
34095 Nobody.
34096 I waited and rang the bell a third time.
34097 No one.
34098 I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food.
34099 Pathetic.
34100 Friendly staff and great Americanos!
34101 An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need.
34102 Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home.
34103 I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs.
34104 Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!
34105 Been twice.
34106 Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get.
34107 Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!!
34108 Loved the decor.
34109 Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants.
34110 Well I have been looking for a good barber and I have just found him.
34111 Like many other of the reviews it is very hard to find a good barber and if your looking for one go here and see Phil.
34112 I saw the other reviews on yelp and thought I would try him out.
34113 I went and got a haircut wash and an honest to goodness hot foam straight shave (hard to find now days) and it all came out wonderful.
34114 I thought the prices were in line for the area and maybe cheap for the service.
34115 32.00 for all the services, I think it is 17 for just a haircut.
34116 I recommend anyone to go see him if you need a good cut or shave.
34117 After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho.
34118 I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new.
34119 I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen!
34120 I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes.
34121 The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed.
34122 The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon.
34123 We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls.
34124 As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared.
34125 Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering.
34126 I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation.
34127 The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho.
34128 I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars!
34129 Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl!
34130 :)
34131 Consistent with the east coast stores, great flavor selection, friendly and accommodating staff.
34132 The regular size doesn't look big but it is plenty for the price, not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products.
34133 A much better value than Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, and self serve froyo.
34134 I can't say enough wonderful things about this branch!
34135 The manager is fantastic, the other employees are happy, enthusiastic, and efficient.
34136 Not to mention that everyone there has impeccable manners and they treat their customers as customers deserve to be treated!
34137 Go to this branch, you'll understand what I mean!
34138 Had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time.
34139 The owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted!
34140 what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it.
34141 Every time I go there, I regret the decision.
34142 And in my grandiose style, I'm going to say why in a list:
34143 1) Cash only!!
34144 But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction.
34145 WHY???
34146 ?
34147 2) The location kinda blows.
34148 It's in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall.
34149 Have you ever driven by there in the day time?
34150 It's shady then, imagine at night time.
34151 3) too hipster.
34152 I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs.
34153 I, in my mall clothing and "mainstream" style, stick out like a sore thumb.
34154 4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking, it's just off.
34155 Okay, the floor is fancy.
34156 That's about it.
34157 (sorry, I'm a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)
34158 Very loud, crowded and quite unpleasant.
34159 I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable.
34160 Great tire shop.
34161 I brought in my car because I kept losing air in a tire, they found a nail, removed it and patched the tire in 10 minutes flat.
34162 Very nice people, and very fair prices.
34163 Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!
34164 They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with.
34165 You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably won't be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree's come, but the medley of salsa's it comes with make it all worth it.
34166 I've tried quite a few of the dishes here, and they've all been excellent.
34167 In no particular order are my favorites:
34168 cheddar enchilada's with hatch chiles and rice...spicy!
34169 santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy!
34170 cod and shrimp tostada's- delicious!
34171 shrimp fajitas
34172 shrimp tacos
34173 And for dessert:
34174 fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"
34175 Always consistent.
34176 Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day.
34177 I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great...
34178 I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full.
34179 The food was excellent.
34180 Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it.
34181 The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well.
34182 Overall a very good experience- we will be back!
34183 I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros.
34184 So, when we received a coupon for Daphne's Greek Café we were jazzed to go check it out.
34185 What I noticed right away is it has kind of a fast-food sort of feel to it and I thought, OK, its catering to people on their lunch breaks.
34186 However, the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better.
34187 The plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat.
34188 This amounted to zilch to me.
34189 When I got to eat, I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at.
34190 At Daphne's you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat.
34191 The falafel meat is little over fried disks.
34192 That's right disks.
34193 Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.
34194 The pita bread is not.
34195 It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.
34196 The tzatziki sauce is ... what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup?
34197 The vegetables were fresh.
34198 There is more to complain about with this place, but you get the picture.
34199 I'm thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like.
34200 Gourmet markets, to me, are like candy shops to a sugar freak.
34201 "Hello, my name is Thomas.
34202 And I am a FoodAholic."
34203 There I said it.
34204 Do you feel better.
34205 Huh?
34206 Oh.
34207 Sorry.
34208 Didn't mean to get so defensive.
34209 But how can you defend AJ's?
34210 How?
34211 How I ask you?
34212 Ok, so it's REALLY expensive.
34213 And, yes, they should provide a blood donor center at the entrance to give cash on the spot for shoppers plasma.
34214 I HATE huge markets.
34215 Fry's too big.
34216 Safeway just right.
34217 AJ's just right and then some.
34218 The produce section is perfection.
34219 Not mounds and mounds of produce you know is wrinkling and rotting more than Bea Arthur in season 6 of the Golden Girls.
34220 Cute little baskets hold just enough fruit and veggies to select from and not too much where you know it's all riddled with germs and spiddle.
34221 The meats and cheeses?
34222 Oh, my!
34223 The filet (at a whopping $34.99 a pound) is worth every bite.
34224 Of course it'll be a year or so when I would pay that much again.
34225 Hello?
34226 Blood donation station idea!
34227 The ready made food is dee lish...curry chicken salad and brocolli delight to name two.
34228 Yes, it' s called brocolli delight.
34229 My gay ass did not name it.
34230 I would have called it beautiful broccoli.
34231 Just rolls off the tongue better.
34232 I've never had a cart wobble...see Fry's review...they ride smooth and apparently are good for the enviornment.
34233 Flowers, baked goods, dishes....AJ's.
34234 It's here.
34235 I'm queer.
34236 Get used to it.
34237 This place is fantastic.
34238 About the restaurant itself.
34239 It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.
34240 The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.
34241 A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.
34242 The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.
34243 Now about the service.
34244 I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.
34245 The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.
34246 She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.
34247 The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.
34248 Now for the best part.
34249 I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.
34250 The first time I came here I got the waffles.
34251 Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.
34252 I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.
34253 I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.
34254 Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.
34255 The second time I came I got the pancakes.
34256 Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.
34257 The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).
34258 Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.
34259 Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!
34260 I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.
34261 First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.
34262 This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.
34263 We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.
34264 It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.
34265 It's good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there.
34266 We used the taco cart for my 30th birthday this past weekend and we came away very impressed.
34267 Eduardo was the guy that came to our fiesta, and he was incredible.
34268 When he arrived, we experienced a haboob and he immediately stepped in and helped bring in our decorations and furniture.
34269 He waited about 30 minutes until serving because we were unsure if the haboob was going to attack again.
34270 My wife and I are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests, we all came away impressed with the food quality.
34271 Next time we throw a party, we will use them again!
34272 Make sure to get the el pastor and carnitas.
34273 Great job Hector & Eduardo.
34274 I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine.
34275 I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!
34276 I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door.
34277 I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book.
34278 Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off.
34279 Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing.
34280 Like your own little happy wine bar world.
34281 They have an amazing wood burning oven.
34282 Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven.
34283 I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had!
34284 It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!
34285 ), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar.
34286 I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them!
34287 Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious.
34288 I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently "better than baba!"
34289 Now for the drinks.
34290 Holy cow.
34291 I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks.
34292 Or so I thought.
34293 Coconut mojito anyone!?
34294 Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!
34295 As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level.
34296 I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars.
34297 Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!
34298 The staff was top notch as well.
34299 I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing.
34300 I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.
34301 I can't wait to go back!
34302 For drinks and food!
34303 I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!
34304 Joe's is truly a special place!!
34305 What makes this place so awesome is that you literally feel like you stepped back into an American farmhouse situated somewhere in the 1940's.
34306 The employees are fully compitent in their abilities and they seem happy to work there.
34307 They have homemade root beer, which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste.
34308 They also serve Barq's Red Cream soda from tap, which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest.
34309 The outdoor dining area has benches in a picnic style setting, while the indoor dining area features a vintage John Deere tractor as the center piece.
34310 The side dishes are kind of small (one scoop), so you might want to opt for and extra side...the mac and cheese rocks!!
34311 I also recommend getting cornbread or lemon cake for desert!
34312 !
34313 I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my "uncouth" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway.
34314 However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss...
34315 It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine.
34316 Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot.
34317 We enjoy good food and supporting local.
34318 The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat!
34319 While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book.
34320 We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95).
34321 Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states "no substitutions or modifications"...
34322 Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a "modification"?
34323 At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as "Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body."
34324 It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's "beauty" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of "nothing fancy."
34325 How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then?
34326 The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams "pretentious and grandiose" and tainted our entire experience.
34327 To quote my dinning companion, "You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!"
34328 Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's.
34329 Healthy, hearty and great service.
34330 It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place.
34331 Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order.
34332 I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special.
34333 Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time.
34334 ;)
34335 Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer!
34336 :)
34337 This is my parents' favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation.
34338 The owner/proprietress convinced my mom (in mandarin) to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn't even know what would be coming.
34339 The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu).
34340 There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup.
34341 The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.
34342 Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip.
34343 I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish.
34344 Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well.
34345 We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point.
34346 If you really want to experience authentic shanghai food, let the staff order for you, you won't regret it.
34347 I haven't written a review in ages, but this place is SO GOOD that I'd be ashamed of myself if I didn't review it.
34348 I am the most hyberbolic person in the whole world in the history of time, but this time, when I say that it was the best pancakes I've ever had, I'm not kidding.
34349 Just insanely delicious.
34350 Scrambled eggs were also some of the best I've had (and come on, they're scrambled eggs, so you don't expect that much variety), and the breakfast potatoes were very good.
34351 I couldn't pinpoint the seasoning, but it's different than you usually get.
34352 Coffee:  Yum.
34353 I don't think I'd even heard of Arbuckle's, but apparently it's got a great reputation, and deservedly so.
34354 The owner Joe stopped by our table, and was super nice and genuine.
34355 Service was just fine too.
34356 I'm sure Joe's will get a reputation and huge following soon, so believe the hype and check it out.
34357 My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since.
34358 The food was really unspectacular, they weren't really that hot.
34359 The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less.
34360 The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele.
34361 Lastly, the staff was not nice.
34362 Fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut I've ever gotten.
34363 I was told that my hair cut looked better than when I was paying $200+
34364 My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
34365 Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat.
34366 Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!
34367 !
34368 1.
34369 The people that work there are AMAZING.
34370 They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want.
34371 (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.)
34372 2.
34373 This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix.
34374 I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat.
34375 (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms)
34376 3.
34377 Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present.
34378 Keep Rocking Yasu!!
34379 !
34380 The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but something's are expected at the olive garden...
34381 The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected...
34382 The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....
34383 When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system.
34384 I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters.
34385 With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better.
34386 Placebo effect, probably.
34387 But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care.
34388 The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley.
34389 And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes!
34390 And their clam chowder is delicious; I don't need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort.
34391 The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits.
34392 I always have customer service problems with Fedex.
34393 How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?
34394 I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.
34395 I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.
34396 Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.
34397 I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.
34398 But this time they really pissed me off.
34399 I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.
34400 I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.
34401 So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.
34402 I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.
34403 I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.
34404 So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.
34405 (I know I do not have such an account!).
34406 Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.
34407 WTF?
34408 How much more information can I provide?
34409 Do they want my height and weight?
34410 Maybe my blood type?
34411 Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?
34412 This is why I say that Fedex really blows!
34413 I was given a $100 gift card to use at Willow Stream Spa last December...
34414 I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.
34415 Well, guess what?
34416 Today was that day!
34417 With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved "Gabi time" as I like to call my downtime.
34418 I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.
34419 Lucky for me, there were several!
34420 The one that was most appealing to me was the "book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it."
34421 I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it...
34422 I was in heaven!
34423 I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.
34424 Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.
34425 I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.
34426 I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out!
34427 The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine...
34428 I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.
34429 I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).
34430 She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!
34431 Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.
34432 I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.
34433 So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.
34434 After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book...
34435 It was so peaceful.
34436 It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it!
34437 So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!
34438 I'm feeling energized, relaxed, and peaceful.
34439 I am *floored* that this place has 4 stars.
34440 Literally fell out of my chair, picked myself up, then continued on to write my review.
34441 The staff is friendly at this restaurant - I'll give them that.
34442 It's relatively clean and has decent prices.
34443 That's where any positives end.
34444 The food here is absolutely disgusting.
34445 Nothing has any flavour - no flavour at all.
34446 None.
34447 Nada.
34448 The salsa is peppery water at best, the beans are mush, and the rice just tastes like plain white rice.
34449 I had a ground beef burrito, which I'd think would be difficult to mess up... Nope.
34450 Not for these guys.
34451 The beef itself was unseasoned burnt 80/20 ground beef.
34452 There was at least 3lbs of sour cream.
34453 And for God's sake -- even the "cheese mixture" had zero flavour.
34454 I've eaten better pizza boxes.
34455 Pass on this places, dudes.
34456 Very friendly staff, cute decor!
34457 Small, but don't let that fool you, best sandwiches ever!!
34458 The egg salad sandwich was so good, it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid!
34459 Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy!!
34460 Talked to the owner and she was very nice.
34461 HA HAHAHAHAHA!
34462 "Pit" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness.
34463 now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark....
34464 I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto.
34465 opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial.
34466 You know?
34467 I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat.
34468 well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.
34469 the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing "sexy" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she?
34470 inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).
34471 i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?)
34472 and they took her $5 and let her in no problem.
34473 i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt.
34474 it was so incredible i took a picture.
34475 she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.
34476 anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave.
34477 i love this place and eat there every time I'm in the area.
34478 Pizza, pasta, appetizers all fantastic.
34479 Plan to spend some time waiting for a table.
34480 We always have fun just eating at the bar.
34481 Yumm
34482 This is an awesome family owned business.
34483 We've had consistently fresh and delicious food each time we've been here.
34484 They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places.
34485 Highly recommend this place.
34486 Prices are not bad either.
34487 When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer.
34488 This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive!
34489 You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon.
34490 Say hello to the mule on your way in.
34491 Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!
34492 ), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing.
34493 Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals.
34494 For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits.
34495 The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.
34496 Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see.
34497 I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two..
34498 Full disclosure: one way or another, I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour, but the happy hour is darn good.
34499 You can, and you should, get that kettle of green chili pork or the big-ass burger, or better yet, share the two with someone nice.
34500 The huckleberry margarita is so good, I've had three in one sitting (no, I wasn't driving!).
34501 I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon, because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering.
34502 It gets pretty busy during the happy hour, though, so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large.
34503 i love the $5 happy hours.
34504 all the dishes are a great value and delicious!
34505 It's high time I wrote a review for Desert Jade.
34506 I grew up on their food.
34507 So many amazing family memories were created here so it's tough for me to go anywhere else and be quite as happy.
34508 The owners know my family and are always ready with a hug.
34509 This is truly a real-deal Phoenix institution.
34510 I have so many favorite items but here are few must-tries: chicken lettuce wraps (I'd been eating these here looooong before so-called "fusion" joints like PF Chang's had them on their menu), sizzling rice chicken, sesame chicken, Desert Jade chow mein, honey-dipped chicken wings, any one of their delicious soups.
34511 So much to choose from and it's all done exceedingly well with true consistency.
34512 Support a local, family-run joint for truly fabulous Chinese food!
34513 I wish that this place were not so good - I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks.
34514 The location that One Coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard.
34515 Several coffee houses went out of business in this location, unable to compete with Starbucks.
34516 One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why.
34517 One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent.
34518 The staff is always friendly.
34519 This place is certainly doing something right; everytime I go in there it has more and more customers.
34520 I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them, figuring they'd be swamped with business.
34521 Now I can't get them to call me back so I can use my deal.
34522 (NOTE: There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal.)
34523 Of course, Living Social is no help - their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area.
34524 This kind of thing, I predict, will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site: the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesn't perform.
34525 I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY deal-of-the-day email out there.
34526 Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics.
34527 The Duce is a disaster.
34528 As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown.
34529 I wanted to love this place.
34530 The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service.
34531 The parking is atrocious.
34532 It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food.
34533 They were out of just about everything we wanted to order.
34534 So disappointing.
34535 However I decided to give them a second shot.
34536 Everyone has a rough night.
34537 We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce.
34538 Management needs to wake up.
34539 Great concept.
34540 Horrific customer service and staff.
34541 NOTE: Ignore the reviews above.
34542 It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place.
34543 Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.
34544 If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.
34545 Positives
34546 I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good.
34547 I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there.
34548 Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.
34549 It's not a restaurant.
34550 It's basically a Dosa shop.
34551 They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types.
34552 They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.
34553 The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.
34554 This is a lunch/light dinner place.
34555 Don't think of this place like a restaurant.
34556 There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.
34557 The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.
34558 Negatives
34559 Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good.
34560 For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.
34561 Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).
34562 The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.
34563 Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.
34564 Their mango shake wasn't very good.
34565 Their chiku shake is great.
34566 Mail Call is a full service shipping store.
34567 The owners are great-they are friendly and accommodating.
34568 I purchase shipping supplies from them are their prices are very fair, much less than a larger place up in the airpark.
34569 They take care all of my local needs and get the job done.
34570 Kudos to Mail Call!
34571 I love the other locations of Thai Rama and this one is no exception!
34572 Food is fast, fresh tasting and well seasoned.
34573 The lunch specials are unique and delicious, and the service is good.
34574 Far superior to the Char's Thai restaurant that used to be in the same location.
34575 This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley.
34576 They serve both Korean and Japanese food.
34577 They are quick and attentive.
34578 Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix.
34579 I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific.
34580 I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes.
34581 They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes.
34582 Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides.
34583 It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for "dessert."
34584 Dr. Pierrend is ok, he will write prescriptions for about anything without really investigating if the are needed but he seems like a nice guy.
34585 The staff are horrible.
34586 They tried to charge me 2 times for lab results which are covered by my insurance.
34587 Refused to give me the results without billing insurance for an office visit.
34588 I would not recommend this medical provider to anyone.
34589 Everyone in my family has gone to PMG and has a bad story to tell.
34590 If you are smart you will look elsewhere for medical help
34591 Fabulous place to get wine, beer, spirits.
34592 It also has amazing keg selection.
34593 Best bruschetta I have had here.
34594 Good wine selection as well.
34595 My favorite bruschetta are:
34596 -smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil
34597 -roasted chicken, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese
34598 -pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepper
34599 -mozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamic
34600 If you want Cheap go to Walmart!
34601 But if you want authentic eclectic trinkets that you will proudly own and showcase in your home this is the place for you!
34602 Very unpleasant experience.
34603 Creepy male doctor.
34604 Uncaring.
34605 And no help.
34606 I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems.
34607 The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined.
34608 I'm not kidding.
34609 Mom was right: good doctors don't advertise.
34610 This place actually solicits Yelp reviews.
34611 Huge Fan of this place.
34612 People in the food industry should take a lesson from these guys as they have great customer service.
34613 Huge fan of the sandwiches.
34614 My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails.
34615 WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place.
34616 It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA.
34617 The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly.
34618 We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!
34619 I have been attending Az Combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic.
34620 They teach Kickboxing, Jui-jitsu and MMA classes.
34621 Az Combat was one of the very first MMA Gyms in Arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation.
34622 My daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp.
34623 I would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced  looking to break into the MMA circle.
34624 They have produced some of the top named fighters in Arizona.
34625 Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too!
34626 I love the beet salad with chicken added.
34627 It's delish!
34628 My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries.
34629 Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!
34630 ZERO stars!
34631 I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX).
34632 I have a couple complaints;
34633 One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL.
34634 One ended up being 14lbs.
34635 over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad).
34636 I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)!
34637 This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge!
34638 I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)!
34639 On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly.
34640 I couldn't believe that!
34641 On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere!
34642 She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly.
34643 She raised he voice at me and called me "a very inhumane person" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry.
34644 I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO.
34645 This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished.
34646 Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
34647 Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees.
34648 I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past.
34649 It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.
34650 I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!
34651 Bad... food was horrible... do not waste your time or money
34652 Nicely edited selection of mid to high end electronics.
34653 Knowledgeable and professional staff.
34654 These guys (and gals) know what they are talking about and will go the extra mile in terms of customer service.
34655 Thinking about splurging on a home theater?
34656 Ask for Scott.
34657 He will listen to you and help you build your dream system within your budget.
34658 He will even respond to your hi-fi emergencies (eg.
34659 the guests are arriving for your Super Bowl party and you don't remember how to work the mission control style remote).
34660 .:chomp:.
34661 this is one .:mmmghgh:.
34662 good burger .
34663 :sllluuuurrrpp:.
34664 It's got a great combination of yumminess with a side of .:chomp:.
34665 awesomeness.
34666 The burgers are great and .:chomp:.
34667 perfect.
34668 The custard is great .:lick:.
34669 and diabetic friendly .:mmmmmmm:.
34670 (They have no sugar added custard).
34671 i would definitely recommend this place!
34672 .
34673 :lick:.
34674 I have been looking for a great therapist for a long time.
34675 Someone that takes the time to read my body, to see the synergy of the muscles and be able to do the work.
34676 Finally, I found Robert.
34677 He has been an LMT for more than 15 years in the Valley and continues to educated himself often.
34678 His studio is located conveniently just off of the 51 about 10 minutes in a quiet residential neighborhood.
34679 The massage intake questioning was thorough, but not invasive.
34680 His set up is calming and the room & table were warmed by a heater!
34681 The massage lasted 90 minutes or so, I didn't want to go back to the real world.
34682 He does offer Gift Certificates and has Pay Pal set up on his website if you didn't plan ahead with stopping for cash.
34683 I will definitely visit him again when I need the work!
34684 Just tried this place this afternoon.
34685 Very friendly staff & great rates with no commitments.
34686 You don't need to worry about paying some $25-$40 co pay like at a regular Chiropractic's office each time you visit.
34687 It's $49 a month and you get four visits a month.
34688 It's not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit.
34689 This goes month to month.
34690 Try it out once for $19 if you want.
34691 This company is really growing.
34692 So stop by and see for yourself!
34693 !
34694 We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes.
34695 We were not comp'd for anything.
34696 When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order.
34697 I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the "we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record" line.
34698 Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record.
34699 They refused to honor the credit....and were rude.
34700 I asked to speak to the owner, and was told "he's out of town."
34701 The pizza is mediocre at best.
34702 I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this.
34703 PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized.
34704 By far the best taco shop in the valley.
34705 Their rolled tacos are delicious.
34706 I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint.
34707 The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal "taco shop", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly.
34708 They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet.
34709 Yuuuuuuum.
34710 I am impressed!
34711 I finally got a chance to check out the MIM yesterday and I was really wowed by the extensive collection.
34712 I knew going in to expect items from all over the world, but there are literally instruments and related objects from every country.
34713 We spent between two and two and a half hours but it still wasn't enough time to really take in everything.
34714 I loved that the audio/video guide was included in the $15 admission price.
34715 Most museums I have been to charge an additional fee.
34716 This was unlike any guide I have experienced before.
34717 No numbers to punch in, just walk by any of the exhibits with your headset on and when you stop at each video screen, the audio automatically starts up!
34718 Very cool, and I loved watching all the videos to learn more about all the instruments.
34719 When I walked up to the flamenco part of the Spain exhibit I instantly recognized the video playing as I have actually been in the flamenco club in Madrid where it was filmed so I thought that was neat.
34720 I really enjoyed all of the exhibits especially seeing the "guts" of the Steinway piano and how Martin guitars are made.
34721 It's not something I had thought about much before but now I know so much!
34722 I think the MIM is a fab place to take kids (and adults!)
34723 to learn and to get them excited about music.
34724 Definitely check it out it you haven't yet.
34725 Edited to add: If you are a Bank of America card holder, you can get into the MIM for free the first full weekend of each month in 2011.
34726 I really like this place...
34727 Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown.
34728 We were immediately greeted as we walked in.
34729 I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best.
34730 Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing.
34731 We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread.
34732 Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love.
34733 It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds.
34734 You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great.
34735 I really enjoyed the Crackerjack.
34736 The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.
34737 I can't wait to come back...
34738 Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price.
34739 Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!
34740 Pros:
34741 -No breed restrictions on dogs
34742 -Washer and dryer in unit
34743 Cons:
34744 -Awful and idiotic leasing staff.
34745 Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly.
34746 -Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time)
34747 -Trash divers daily that no one does anything about
34748 -No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a "courtesy patrol" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed
34749 -Vandalized cars
34750 -A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire)
34751 -The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean.
34752 The 3 other pools are small, dirty, and frequently closed.
34753 -Bug infestations in most apartments
34754 -Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all
34755 -The basketball court and tennis courts are never available, as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff
34756 -Tons of potholes!
34757 Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking
34758 -The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box.
34759 Freezing in the winter, sweltering in the summer.
34760 Nothing is fitted correctly to it's frame, either.
34761 If you can afford a better place, I highly reccommend it.
34762 Best noodles in Phoenix.
34763 This place is hands down the best chinese food in Phoenix.
34764 PF Changes has nothing on these guys, they are fast, friendly and food is hot.
34765 Its also excellent for leftovers too.
34766 Have been in twice since my last review.
34767 Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere!!
34768 And sorry to say this is not in a good way.
34769 Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out.
34770 Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight!
34771 They were like natzi's with the seating you have to have 75% of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar.
34772 We should've just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers.
34773 Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers.
34774 At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted.
34775 I wasn't going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip.
34776 I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that.
34777 I'm going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time i've heard of this happening there.
34778 With that said..
34779 I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN!
34780 This place has gone down hill!!
34781 .
34782 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !!
34783 Very disappointed
34784 Hands down the best middle eastern restaurant in the Tempe area.
34785 You can't beat the prices, everything is always consistently good (we go here about once a week).
34786 Favorites:
34787 Hummus and Gyro Delux!
34788 Don't forget to grab some baklava too, this is the best i've ever had (and that includes having some while in the middle east)
34789 Primp and Blow at the Waterfront is divine!
34790 I walked out feeling like a
34791 Super Model without spending a fortune!
34792 Great Stylists.
34793 Upbeat Friendly
34794 atmosphere.
34795 Great Tunes and an overall GREAT VIBE!
34796 Convenient Parking
34797 and centrally located right near Fashion Square and Olive and Ivy.
34798 LOVE it!
34799 My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures!
34800 They turned out beautiful and lasted forever!
34801 Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon!
34802 Keep it up!
34803 If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.
34804 First, this place has beer.
34805 Don't order mixed drinks, don't order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar.
34806 This is the place you'd go to with your fake ID because when you're 19 this is what you think a bar should be.
34807 Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom.
34808 I had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants, especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.
34809 It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.
34810 It was not fresh at all!
34811 Very over priced!
34812 For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.
34813 It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.
34814 I will never be back for the food.
34815 The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it.
34816 Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza
34817 It's the only thing I've ever ordered there
34818 And it alone warrants 5 stars.
34819 This place is fantastic.
34820 Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor...
34821 I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits.
34822 My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata.
34823 The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg.
34824 There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish.
34825 It came with a side of toast.
34826 I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick.
34827 The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top.
34828 The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum.
34829 After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze.
34830 I liked it a lot.
34831 What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel.
34832 I will definetly make it a point to come here again.
34833 This is a brand new delicatessen who's grand opening was September 24th 2008.
34834 Since I don't have a kitchen in my place, this re-heat one-stop shop near my neighborhood will be a place I plan to frequent via walking.
34835 They have a cute cook book lounge and the deli layout is fun to just paroose.
34836 Their chocolate chip cookies taste home made.
34837 So nice to still feel like you have some input in the cooking preparation process when you live with just a microwave.
34838 Cheap!
34839 Cheap!
34840 Beware!
34841 If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.
34842 Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge, go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!
34843 Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch.
34844 We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken.
34845 The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates.
34846 I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them.
34847 They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns.
34848 This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish.
34849 When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount.
34850 Well.
34851 we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal, but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food.
34852 That never happened.
34853 Unless something changes, the burgers are decent and that is about it.
34854 holy shit i love this place.
34855 I have been a regular here for years.
34856 Eating at oregano's after a long work/school week is really something to look forward to.
34857 The food is great.
34858 Its reasonably priced, the portions are huge, and the drinks are tall.
34859 don't expect anything CRAZY culinary creations here, its just not part of the restaurant's culture.
34860 The food is simple and everything is tasty.
34861 I usually go with the Sausage Sandwich, or one of the pasta dishes with whole grain pasta, and one of their giant meat balls.
34862 Its always filling,
34863 always good.
34864 Sure the wait is long, but they always have free pizza, drinks, and deserts while you are waiting.
34865 Service is always great.
34866 Friendly, prompt, and they don't bother you when you don't need them.
34867 All of the servers are always willing to play along with my friends and our inappropriate conversations, challenges, etc.
34868 My boyfriends company has been doing business with this PostNet store for the last 4 years.
34869 Service is friendly, prompt and helpful.
34870 I highly recommend it.
34871 Nice Plaza.
34872 Very well located.
34873 Clean store.
34874 Friendly staff.
34875 All you could want
34876 Great place - nice ambiance, cool decor, tasty food and good service!
34877 We were going to check out the Spotted Donkey, but finding it out of business, we noticed Grassroots across the parking lot and decided to check it out.
34878 My daughter got the brisket sandwich (she let me try a bite - nice combination of BBQ sauce, slaw and pickles - but she picked out the pickles and slaw!)
34879 The fries were quite nice as well.
34880 I tried the short ribs - asian fusion sauce with asparagus and jalapeño cheesy grits...I've never been a fan of grits, but these were tasty!
34881 The ribs were very nice...the sauce reminded me of something my Mom used to make (but I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it was familiar).
34882 A browned with toffee flakes and gelato on top capped off a very nice dinner.
34883 (And you've gotta love a place that has the Gadsden flag as part of it's decor).
34884 Definitely will be coming back!
34885 (and my apologies to our attentive and helpful server for not having been more demonstrative of my appreciation for the food...it was quite good, I just wasn't in a 'dang that's good!'
34886 mood last night)  Check this place out!
34887 !
34888 I work on a local event called Ignite Phoenix, and somewhere in the mix we contacted Splinter Creative about helping us with the design and material for our event.
34889 We were completely new to this game and didn't really know what good branding and imagery could do for us.
34890 They stepped in, gave us some amazing ideas, helped us refine them, and delivered some incredible material that wowed everyone who attended.
34891 So we asked them to stick with us for our next event, and they did it again.
34892 They keep upping the game, and I now work with them across several different business that I work on.
34893 They've helped me through several difficult creative areas, and the end result is always sharp, professional, interesting, and engaging.
34894 I prefer to work with people who are passionate about what they do, and do it well.
34895 Splinter fits that bill perfectly.
34896 Highly recommended.
34897 I don't have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things.
34898 I had four things so far here.
34899 My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely.
34900 I paid $16 + tip.
34901 I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.
34902 Oh man was this delicious.
34903 The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance.
34904 Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that.
34905 I felt very comfortable here.
34906 They had four sauces on the table.
34907 I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow.
34908 If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you!
34909 I loved it.
34910 Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup.
34911 [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing.
34912 Everything was.
34913 For me, enjoying food means I need a few things.
34914 First - awesome food
34915 Second - ambiance
34916 Third - presentation
34917 They had it all.
34918 I was very impressed by place to the plates.
34919 Don't change a thing.
34920 I hope  your business is very prosperous!
34921 The Valley Beer Drinkers Meetup Group has been coming here for months - since before the name change - on occasional Wednesdays for $3 craft pints & the fantastic wings special.
34922 We've always had a good experience, and the extensive, rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh.
34923 I've been urging the owner to add at least ONE Pilsner to the IPA-heavy menu, and last night he delivered with a quintessential model: Munchener Spaten Pils!
34924 It was great.
34925 Adding to the experience was the excellent food.
34926 Portions were generous and satisfying!.
34927 One member ordered the Fish & Onion Rings, and when it arrived, two others immediately ordered their own!
34928 I can't remember better fish (pollack here) or more perfect onion rings!
34929 Homemade potato chips were remarkable, and the fry cook definitely knows the craft!
34930 Diners have many options for sides w/ entrees, which is a generous touch.
34931 Only the cole slaw was a bit bland.
34932 Service was friendly & generally good, but not attentive enough later in the meal.
34933 Thanks for separate checks, too.
34934 I really look forward to returning for brews and to further explore the enticing menu!
34935 Do not get your oil changed at this walmart or any walmart.
34936 We got a oil change and they dented our oil pan and now it leaks and they are not taking responsibility for the damages they caused.
34937 I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else, when no one else has clearly done our oil.
34938 The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault.
34939 I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change.
34940 I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer.
34941 The democratic party of Arizona consists of a nice group of  people.
34942 I visited their office several years ago with some questions and they were quite helpful.
34943 It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ.
34944 We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes.
34945 That, we did, unfortunately.
34946 The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place.
34947 We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff.
34948 The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away.
34949 No one offered to bring more.
34950 Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine.
34951 After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived.
34952 I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate.
34953 Nothing else on my plate, just the steak.
34954 I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever!
34955 At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!!
34956 We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it!
34957 There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person.
34958 Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish?
34959 In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.
34960 Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more.
34961 Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.
34962 Terrible experience here.
34963 They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus.
34964 Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish.
34965 Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience.
34966 Food was really good.
34967 Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree.
34968 Would for sure go back.
34969 Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.
34970 But the food is also killer.
34971 I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.
34972 I also tried my date's steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it.
34973 The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.
34974 We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.
34975 It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.
34976 It's manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.
34977 I can't say I'd suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions.
34978 This is a great MMA gym.
34979 Instructors are profesional, the facility is clean, and they work well with all experience levels.
34980 We have a show quality teacup Yorkie and a 5 Pound Maltese, who has issues, and they handle them beautifully!
34981 The owners attitude is all about making sure you are happy and your dogs are too!
34982 We were using a place across the street where the owner was all about taking your money and then booking you with who ever was available, even if you had an appointment with a particular groomer!
34983 These guys are the best, they CARE, and it's a pleasure to give them our business.
34984 Just Go!!!!
34985 :-)
34986 I live within walking distance of the Japanese Friendship Garden, so I enjoy it frequently.
34987 Once inside, it's hard to believe you're still in Phoenix.
34988 That's why I was so happy when Groupon recently offered a half-price membership.
34989 I would join in a minute, except they're closed from May to October or so.
34990 Half-price membership seems about right.
34991 The atmosphere is gentle and meditative.
34992 I feel safe sitting on a bench and actually meditating here.
34993 The koi kind of freak me out.
34994 They've been fed so often  by visitors that I feel fairly certain they'd eat me if I fell into the pond.
34995 Last time I visited, there were baby ducks in the house.
34996 So cute and fluffy, and they had no fear of people.
34997 There is only one reason  why I shouldn't love this pizza.
34998 Waiting an OBSCENE amount of time for a pizza is a pretty big one.
34999 If this pizza was not as good I would be angry I think.
35000 I would tell you about it ( HERE)...
35001 but you know what its that good.
35002 I have had pizza around the world ,its not the best..... but this is pretty close to the best you are going to get in this area code.
35003 I would love to say don't believe  "the hype" but yo there is a reason you have to wait sometimes as long as 4+ hours for a pizza on a Saturday night.
35004  Lets really face the reality of that night though.
35005 You are gonna want to hang  around at other bars drinking with your friends anyway.Its certainly not going to be a cheaper night of entertainment either.. Armed with that information you know what to expect.
35006 While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as central.This is worth it just to know what people are talking about.
35007 This Pizza is wood fired and made with world class ingredients.
35008 The thin cust is perfect.
35009 The service at least for me was rushed and sorta unplesant.
35010 We were literally the last people in there by the time they sat us, so I am not sure if that behavior / treatment is normal.
35011 Not a place to pop in and grab a bite to eat with a small group but if you are REALLY not in rush then this place is one of the best in AZ.
35012 Cheese Curds!
35013 They have been so hard to find in AZ.
35014 Like the Jalepeno ones too.
35015 Really good fresh milk.
35016 Worth the stop.
35017 Bring cash, not credit or debit cards
35018 I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of.
35019 I can't say enough good about them, so I won't ramble.... Just love them.
35020 I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.
35021 However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.
35022 We have been twice and I ordered that both times.
35023 The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.
35024 But this sauce is delicious!
35025 It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.
35026 We also loved the jalepeno bacon.
35027 My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.
35028 We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!
35029 Are you kidding me, this place is great.
35030 Perfectly sized bread, quality ingredients, cool staff.
35031 When I think dream sub, I think italian night club no mayo, and extra peppers.
35032 Don't get no betta!
35033 This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake.
35034 But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say "sorry for the inconvenience" or "we made a mistake".
35035 They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated.
35036  I waited, 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie...
35037 I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady.
35038 She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.
35039 Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say "we apologize for the inconvenice".
35040 I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum.
35041 In terms of Mexican joints this place is the best.
35042 With the outdoor atmosphere, tacky decor and authentic food, it just doesn't get any better.
35043 The other locations are just as good.
35044 The staff is usually pretty cool too, although one time we waited a VERY long time to get served at the Scottsdale location.
35045 One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.
35046 Every pasty Ive had here is awesome.
35047 My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.
35048 Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm.
35049 Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.
35050 We eat in and get to go.
35051 Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait.
35052 An organized & clean store, a well educated & nice staff, a great selection of baby/kid products!
35053 I will never go to a babies r us again.
35054 Thank you Chandler buybuybaby!
35055 Place is awsome.
35056 Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.
35057 The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.
35058 Price was pretty good.
35059 Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.
35060 While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.
35061 Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.
35062 5 stars all the way.
35063 Grew up in San Antonio and Austin.
35064 Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country.
35065 The term Texas-style means beef, first.
35066 Period.
35067 And good smoke, and that ain't mesquite.
35068 Oak is king.
35069 These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever.
35070 It's a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by ... well, Scottsdale.
35071 Friggin morons.
35072 If you have not been here, you need to go down to 24th and E. Roeser and try it.
35073 Hands down the best Q in the area, including Cave Creek.
35074 The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats, wheres and hows of Bar-B-Que.
35075 And for those "the meal in a carton on butcher paper" snobs who think that such is declasse, please, do me a favor... Head on down to Austin or, better yet, Lockhart.
35076 Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Black's or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado.
35077 Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities.
35078 Freud said it best: BBQ and being horrifically anally-retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma.
35079 Or, shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers...
35080 Mmm dirty hipster bars.
35081 Let me count the ways in which I love you.
35082 You are cheap (we had $2 Stellas)
35083 You are interesting (local art on the walls that I'm told changes regularly)
35084 You are full of pretension (people watching is always worth the price of admission)
35085 You are friendly (like minded souls can smell each other out)
35086 If you are in the Roosevelt district, I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour.
35087 Its cheap and hipstery.
35088 Both words have been used to describe me, so I am naturally predisposed to this place.
35089 I try and eat here regularly.
35090 Hummus is great.
35091 Very personable staff.
35092 And the atmosphere is awesome.
35093 Look forward to the next time!
35094 I really love this gym.
35095 It is so nice and well maintained.
35096 There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout.
35097 The childcare is excellent and has the security part down.
35098 When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits.
35099 The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me.
35100 You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tv's that are on the cardio equipment.
35101 Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms.
35102 There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cycling,etc.
35103 I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare.
35104 Been dying to come here ever since I saw this place on Unique Eats.
35105 Very laid back gastropub with a friendly, funny/entertaining staff!
35106 We grabbed drinks at the bar first - Moe'scow Mule (ginger beer, cucumber, lime, rocks) & the Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, rocks) which were both good, not too strong, but a good refreshing drink.
35107 Appetizers:
35108 1) Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut)
35109 2) The Original Chopped Salad
35110 Please order both.
35111 They were both delicious!
35112 I was in love with the salad especially.
35113 Entrees:
35114 1) Lamb Burger (Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki, Kennebec French fries & house made ketchup) I tend to be very picky about my lamb... Actually I'm not reallly a fan of it/the particular taste and smell lamb has.
35115 Why I ordered this, I don't know, but I can tell you that I liked it.
35116 The taste/odor of lamb wasn't overwhelming and it was juicy.
35117 2) Pan Seared Scallops (Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens & Red Rock cola gastrique)
35118 3) Amaro Meatloaf (Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace): the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was!
35119 Usually meatloaf is fluffed up with a lot of bread crumbs, but this one was mainly just meat.
35120 The mashed potatoes were very good as well.
35121 Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting!
35122 The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese.
35123 Yuck!!
35124 !
35125 Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco?
35126 Yes.
35127 Yes they do.
35128 Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis?
35129 Oh hell yeah!
35130 Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells.
35131 When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say 'si' and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos.
35132 Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesn't get any better than this.
35133 Just make sure you put a helmet on because it's crazy good.
35134 If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile).
35135 If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates.
35136 The plate comes with flour tortillas, beans and rice, guacamole and salsa fresca.
35137 You make your own burritos.
35138 This is just good eatin'.
35139 Take it home, crack open a good Hefeweizen, and you are golden.
35140 And lastly, from the sage words of my wife: "The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals!"
35141 Do I stutter?
35142 Nope.
35143 While Senor Taco is technically 'fast food' it does take some time to prepare.
35144 If you do drive-thru don't get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell.
35145 There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME.
35146 This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs.
35147 Senor Taco is not that type of place.
35148 A little wait is very much worth it.
35149 I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers.
35150 Yes, it is in a strip mall.
35151 Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market.
35152 I get that.
35153 But this is not Sanctuary.
35154 This is not Kai.
35155 This is not Deseo.
35156 When one reviewer (and I use the word 'reviewer' loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well...
35157 I just have to laugh.
35158 That's not a review, it's a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Luby's Cafeteria.
35159 And that's too bad because this is excellent fast food.
35160 I've eaten here maybe 15-20 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick.
35161 The people at Senor Taco are nice, the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better.
35162 I can't recommend highly enough.
35163 Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping.
35164 They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good.
35165 Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H2O hydration instead.
35166 Staff and management were very attentive.
35167 Would definitely recommend.
35168 I've been Dr. Castilla's office for 7 years.
35169 Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.
35170 She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.
35171 She makes eye contact with you and I couldn't ask for anything more.
35172 Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.
35173 But, she's worth the wait!
35174 Now that we've relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.
35175 She's irreplaceable!
35176 there is none better.
35177 This taco shop is off the beaten path hidden and mixed in next to a smoke shop and behind a circle k.  Parking can be at a premium but the payoff is the food.
35178 great friendly service, low key on the inside and flavors and textures that rock your socks off!!
35179 I mean really.
35180 My favorite taco shop in the valley, or more to the point prob.
35181 one of the best in the west!
35182 the burros are as think as a mans arm, the tacos are soooo good.
35183 i especially like the chorizo, the lingua is good, the carne is excellent.
35184 have a cane sugar coke in a bottle and find a seat, inside or out you will savor the flavors and be sure to use the sides of grilled peppers and onions, they make the meal for me.
35185 now where to go for lunch ?
35186 Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.
35187 We've been here three or four times and are never disappointed.
35188 Good reviews are easy to write.
35189 Stop reading this and just go eat there!
35190 OK, well I have visited this place for years now and don't go anywhere else if I am in this area.
35191 I like the Chef's, they are friendly and quick.
35192 They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I don't dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha.
35193 The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20?
35194 I've tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and can't do it for under $40 or more for two.
35195 All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical.
35196 Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner.
35197 The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant.
35198 Some reviews on here complain about them.
35199 I don't have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well.
35200 I will keep coming back.
35201 Thank you Jen & Mike for making what I expected to be a hard decision so easy!
35202 My boyfriend and I will do all of our future shopping at this location!
35203 Whatever you need here ask for them, Jen is the store manager and Mike was more than amazing!
35204 They told us that not many people knew about this location and I promised I would change that!
35205 Make sure to post your awesome experience next!
35206 I love my ring!!!
35207 !
35208 Best calamari in town, and awesome service.
35209 Tokyo glow is a great drink, super refreshing.
35210 Yes, it's pricey, so I got a membership.
35211 Yes, the membership is pricey - but if you go frequently (and you'll want to with the hot summer months) you'll get your money's worth and then some.
35212 The place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip.
35213 Great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element, too!
35214 We were greeted with very friendly staff.
35215 We had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce - usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good.
35216 The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.
35217 We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.
35218 I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.
35219 I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.
35220 For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.
35221 My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.
35222 I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!!
35223 We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.
35224 My husband had coffee and even that was great.
35225 A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -  we think it was worth it.
35226 This will be a definite dining destination in the future.
35227 Experience with Hostess was rude.
35228 Service with a frown.
35229 Our waiter had attitude too.
35230 It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity.
35231 The margaritas were strong-check ok there.
35232 The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp.
35233 We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID.
35234 Yup.
35235 I said RANCID.
35236 We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.
35237 Poor service with an attitude.
35238 Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced.
35239 Never going back.
35240 Great food their pork is awesome !!!!
35241 The slow cooking made this dish superb.
35242 Of course the margaritas are as good as they get!
35243 Overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great.
35244 The place was very busy with allot of energy.
35245 I can't remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp, but I will never forget the taste.
35246 FABULOUS is an understatement!
35247 The NY pizza was equally as great.
35248 Every time I come here I say to myself, we need to come more often.
35249 Everything is always good.
35250 Diane was our server tonight.
35251 What a cutie!
35252 More important is that the service was excellent!
35253 Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.
35254 Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.
35255 At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive "Your more than welcome", instead of the typical "No Problem" statement coming from young people.
35256 I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him, his smile and mannerisms.
35257 We will be back!
35258 Like they even need another review - they have a solid 5 stars as it is!
35259 Just got back from my first visit to Adobe, and I am beyond impressed.
35260 My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays, so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side.
35261 I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.
35262 The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person.
35263 She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56).
35264 I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in.
35265 Even better!
35266 The tech was very good with Nately's 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time.
35267 I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog.
35268 Okay, maybe some aren't, but I am, and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child.
35269 Dr. Newland was AWESOME.
35270 The difference between him and some other vets I've been to?
35271 - Other vets: "Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc...
35272 -Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable.
35273 He spent 20 minutes going over everything (Nately's last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said "Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach.
35274 He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free".
35275 He also dispensed advice for Nately's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc.
35276 I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many).
35277 I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.
35278 I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible.
35279 If only they treated birds too!
35280 T&S Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window.
35281 They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call, had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen.
35282 Frank installed the glass and couldn't have been nicer.
35283 Thank you T & S Glass!
35284 !
35285 When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway.
35286 A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat.
35287 Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.
35288 All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.
35289 We had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio.
35290 If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here
35291 I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.
35292 The staff are incredibly accomodating.
35293 What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!
35294 It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!
35295 I was there just last night, and today received a ROTD for my original review.
35296 Too weird.
35297 Updates - They mix a great margarita!
35298 No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice.
35299 Yum.
35300 The wine list is small but good.
35301 My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.
35302 It's only $6 a glass, and they pour generously.
35303 Very tasty wine.
35304 The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch.
35305 If you sit up straight, it's fine.
35306 But seriously.... good posture is over rated.
35307 It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter.
35308 Wear long sleeves.
35309 :) After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night, I didn't care.
35310 This place has really been growing on me... nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole!
35311 Amazing Mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good.
35312 Have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me.
35313 I love this store.
35314 The produce is always fresh, they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers, the meat department is outstanding - I've tried a few different kabobs from here (spicy kabob rocks), bakery is great, nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt, fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off, excellent selection of wines and craft beer, and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements.
35315 Aside from the above, they make great sandwiches, have a nice salad bar, have different take out dinners available every night, have a pasta night and will make you a fantastic iced tea or an iced latte that rivals any chain.
35316 They also have an awesome grill - they will make you a kobe blue cheese burger that is out of this world.
35317 The hot dogs are delicious but they are gigantic (and a little unsettling to look at).
35318 One piece of advice before you go, not everything turns over quickly so check the dates.
35319 I'm not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside Go-Kat-Go, but I finally did and loved it!
35320 This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems.
35321 We've got locally designed clothing in one corner, awesome furniture in another, tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout!
35322 It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it.
35323 The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped.
35324 I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder/oven mitt set in a really cool pattern.
35325 I will definitely be back, especially since my other mom's b-day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff.
35326 Went back to True Foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip) with my mom for dinner last week.
35327 It was amazing as always however this time was different.
35328 I tried a new menu item, the Bison burger ( i highly reccomend this) it was so tastey and very light for a burger.
35329 OMG!
35330 I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER!
35331 Our server Marcus was amazing.
35332 He was very informative, helpful, polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some.
35333 LOVE THIS CAT.
35334 Just thought I would give credit where it is due.
35335 Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives.
35336 I work in a restaurant and know it's important for employers to know who their "stars" are.
35337 MARCUS is your star.
35338 A bright, and shiney star.
35339 lol
35340 Loves: Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups, Ahi sliders, Spaghetti Squash, Kale Salad, Raviolli, Green Tea, Coffe (black) and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart.
35341 Definitely .
35342 I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking.
35343 I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast.
35344 They had a great selection of hot tea.
35345 The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions.
35346 The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy.
35347 They also proved that they can really cook eggs well.
35348 They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us.
35349 I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING.
35350 The service was super fantastic!
35351 I will definitely come here again.
35352 :)
35353 Treated some clients to Sweet Pea Bakery items and they loved them!
35354 I got the PB & J cookies , Mojito cookies and Rum macaroons.
35355 Love that they are not the run of the mill flavors.
35356 The shop is adorable, it's actually really big-- surprisingly big!
35357 The employees are really nice and personable and that is always helpful and welcoming, especially when trying something/some place new.
35358 They even gave me a precious thank you card to put with the cookies.
35359 I will definitely be going back for more!
35360 It's the best!
35361 Downstairs, hanging at the bar, you can't beat it!
35362 The food is EXCELLENT!!
35363 !
35364 Well, this place is as good as it gets.
35365 Family owned and awesome.
35366 You know how at some mexican places the beans and rice are an afterthought?
35367 Not here.
35368 They are the best I have ever had, yes even in mexico.
35369 The food is seasoned perfectly and the service is exceptional.
35370 Too bad they are closed Sundays.
35371 The queso is the best I have ever had.
35372 I could keep going but you get the picture.
35373 Go there, order and eat, you will not be disappointed.
35374 One star is far more than they deserve.
35375 The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.
35376 The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.
35377 People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.
35378 The owner ruined the entire experience.
35379 If this is how customers are treated, this place won't be around long.
35380 This is the best buffet in Az.
35381 HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi.
35382 The quality of food is very good too.
35383 One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside!
35384 This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good.
35385 Just sayin'.
35386 For a buffett, they have a really nice staff.
35387 There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing.
35388 It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks.
35389 I eat here at least once every couple weeks.
35390 NOOOO!!
35391 !
35392 Don't think about it!!!
35393 !
35394 Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks.
35395 The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover.
35396 I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner.
35397 They never fixed the interior trim.
35398 They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water.
35399 I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a "manager" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!)
35400 and couldnt come until a week out!
35401 Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service.
35402 I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB.
35403 This place is great!!!
35404 They grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow, they buy it local!!!
35405 The food tastes great...don't forget to get a milkshake.
35406 It is also a great place to sit and eat outside, nice!
35407 I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed.
35408 I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombra's last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts!
35409 Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night.
35410 Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably don't even know about yet.
35411 I tried three top-notch items:
35412 Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word.
35413 Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren't careful.
35414 Don't skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first.
35415 White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, it's one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try.
35416 Light and sweet, but not overly so, it's a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long.
35417 (I did!)
35418 The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup.
35419 It's nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer.
35420 A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams.
35421 I've always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree.
35422 There's nothing to hide behind, and you're confronted by pure flavor.
35423 It was complex, different and mouthwatering.
35424 The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone.
35425 I have a serious Banana Republic problem.
35426 Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR.
35427 I had just gotten my first full time "real job" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position.
35428 It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR.
35429 The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked!
35430 So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out.
35431 It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it.
35432 That is, when you find something worth buying.
35433 The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff.
35434 But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time.
35435 Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day.
35436 So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60.
35437 Sounds like a good deal to me.
35438 I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all.
35439 My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100.
35440 I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in.
35441 My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that.
35442 Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase.
35443 So your super discounted items just got even more discounted.
35444 I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday, and I will NEVER be the same again.
35445 I don't normally eat cake, in fact, if it's not Brownies, I don't eat it.
35446 But this cake drew me in with it's appealing fondant.
35447 From there, I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake.
35448 A cornicopia of flaverful goodness.
35449 So make a metal note to yourself, I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes.
35450 Oh, and special thanks to Arts G (previous review) for telling me what the hell fondant is.
35451 I was just calling it "sheet like frosting".
35452 This place is our go to mexican place.
35453 I love the hot sauce and you can't go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos.
35454 I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce.
35455 It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat (and I love it).
35456 For the healthier days, I like the Pollo Salad.
35457 The chicken is always great here.
35458 Awesome food.
35459 Highly recommend.
35460 Had gyros platter .
35461 Generous portions and excellent meat.
35462 Check out their spices and other food stuff.
35463 Got couscous very cheap.
35464 One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley!
35465 We go here about once a month.
35466 Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles.
35467 We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert!
35468 YUM!
35469 Love love love this place.
35470 It's a very healthy place to eat and always has awesome food and awesome service!
35471 It's a nice newer gym with a good amount of amenities and a relatively friendly staff.
35472 I see cleaners in the club every time I am there which I dont see a lot of at other gyms.
35473 They have a stretch room, full wet area with steam and sauna, free aerobics classes,  a large number of equip,etc.
35474 The evenings do get crowded even with all the equipment, so I try to get in and out before 5 or so.
35475 All in all a nice spot to get a work out in the area.
35476 Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.
35477 Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.
35478 Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.
35479 The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.
35480 The food is also very reasonably priced.
35481 I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.
35482 You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.
35483 Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.
35484 Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.
35485 I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.
35486 That's it.
35487 Yogis delivers this and then some.
35488 Fantastic venue!
35489 The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent.
35490 The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!)
35491 even if you aren't going to the show!
35492 Cool free shows in the lounge!
35493 Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC!
35494 And the venue itself is awesome!
35495 The sound is great!
35496 The ROOM IS GREAT!
35497 It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound.
35498 And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side.
35499 THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE!
35500 What is left to say ?
35501 GET THERE!
35502 I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all.
35503 This is, by far, the best facility in all of Spring Training (that includes the Florida parks).
35504 Granted, I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the 'Sox fans do, but it is still amazing.
35505 Camelback Ranch is the brand new, state of the art, spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox.
35506 The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO won't stay there.
35507 The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th Ave.  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium.
35508 The grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields.
35509 While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public, the Dodgers' are wide open and inviting.
35510 Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans.
35511 The field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive.
35512 Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $90 per game.
35513 That price gets you seats behind home, access to unlimited food, wine, beer, soda, and sweets.
35514 It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off.
35515 It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money.
35516 The grass seats have a great slope to them (much like Scottsdale) and the seat aisles are wide.
35517 The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs, however.
35518 The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature.
35519 A great stadium and surely one to visit every March.
35520 I was introduced to SanTan Brewery two years ago on a very cold, winter evening.
35521 My cousin knew I would instantly fall in love with this place, simply because I just love fine craft beer.
35522 He was surely right because I visit SanTan three times a week because I simply cannot get enough of their beer selection.
35523 It's like an adventure every time I go.
35524 The staff is fantastic not because they're very nice and friendly, but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as I do, so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic.
35525 I normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this, simply because I personally tell the management team my best regards but I will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer.
35526 SanTan is the new level of drinking and dining experience.
35527 It's relaxed, fun mature environment and you can start a conversation with anyone there.
35528 Enough reading this review, go try it out yourself.
35529 Scottsdale Fashion Square is the king of shopping centers in Arizona.
35530 It's unrivaled and it maintains it's crown through constant improvements, expansions, and new stores.
35531 Empty stores are rare.
35532 Try that on for size, PV mall.
35533 The food court is decent, but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall, providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores, and a great selection of places to eat.
35534 Scottsdale Fashion Square aims to please the most critical, and goes above and beyond all expectations.
35535 Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us.
35536 I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up.
35537 The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food.
35538 I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked.
35539 I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it!
35540 So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it.
35541 So how can they justify that price?
35542 It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.
35543 I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke!
35544 FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.
35545 No value means lost customers ....
35546 Music was loud as shit.
35547 The food, Jesus Christ the food.
35548 Lame ass chips and salsa.
35549 No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.
35550 Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.
35551 Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).
35552 Gross right, warm lettuce.
35553 Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.
35554 Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.
35555 2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.
35556 Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.
35557 I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.
35558 Mint water was warm.
35559 Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.
35560 My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.
35561 I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.
35562 So over the top lame.
35563 Neither my husband nor myself finished.
35564 Meal was $46.
35565 Horrible.
35566 Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.
35567 Such a disappointment, I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.
35568 Won't be returning.
35569 Ever.
35570 I have memories that make my mouth water.
35571 My mother calls me everytime she passes through Phoenix to ask me where this place is.
35572 She tells her friends in Los Angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to Phoenix.
35573 They all rave after their experience.
35574 The fry bread house is as authentic as it gets.
35575 Indian tacos, fry bread with sugar, and oh my god--the red chili stew.
35576 I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard.
35577 The place does get a little cramped during meal times, but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we weren't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures.
35578 Make sure they are open before you make the trek, they have funky hours.
35579 Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat!
35580 The interior is very rocker complete with  stage for bands, interesting and yummy food, with an array of beers  and amazing food!
35581 If you decide to go (which I don't know why you wouldn't ) try their monkey bread for dessert, it is to die for!
35582 As a massage therapist I normally would rather have a massage than get adjusted, that was before Dr. Hunt came to town.
35583 I trust him implicitly, and the techniques he uses are amazing.
35584 I take my four year old to see him too, who always greets Dr. Hunt and Larissa with great big hugs.
35585 Highly recommend this office, truly feels like family
35586 OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!
35587 We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.
35588 Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.
35589 They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?
35590 The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.
35591 We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.
35592 For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni "D".
35593 Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.
35594 And both were HUGE.
35595 The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.
35596 For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.
35597 Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.
35598 Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!
35599 ), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.
35600 This is the KIDS menu!
35601 Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.
35602 Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.
35603 Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.
35604 I am definitely going here again, what a find!
35605 DELICIOUS sandwich prepared fast and just the way I wanted it!
35606 I'll be back for sure!
35607 Welcome to the neighborhood.
35608 I always buy my tires at Walmart, but they didn't have a tire to fit my car.
35609 They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing.
35610 I went to this location and had the best experience.
35611 They were very helpful, saved me money, and I was in and out in under 25 mins.
35612 I will be back again and again!!!
35613 !
35614 This is the best library in the Valley and one of my favorite places to study.
35615 The interior design, water fall, glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown.
35616 The top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city.
35617 Quick Tip: It seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so I always sit on the north part of the building.
35618 I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location.
35619 They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times.
35620 Come on, your job can not be that confusing...
35621 Made me and my bro sick.
35622 Tasted good at first but something wasn't right.
35623 My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden.
35624 We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was.
35625 They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant.
35626 Good to go.
35627 We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99.
35628 So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told "Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right".
35629 No sh!t Sherlock.
35630 So...will you honor the price quoted?
35631 NO.
35632 So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99.
35633 Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists.
35634 I'm in love.
35635 Bacon you have my heart and my stomach.
35636 After all- where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it?
35637 Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions.
35638 Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile.
35639 The location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there.
35640 I was seated in what they call "the nook" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant.
35641 The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham.
35642 You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish.
35643 The food came up quickly and was delicious!
35644 My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty.
35645 Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet.
35646 Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got.
35647 But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place.
35648 It's the fantastic service!
35649 Everyone seems to be part of a larger team.
35650 I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me.
35651 And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast.
35652 It was unbelievable!
35653 While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer.
35654 The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups.
35655 There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food "cues".
35656 I also liked that they have those "roll up" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days.
35657 If I lived in Scottsdale- this would be my "go to" brunch place.
35658 What I don't get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold.
35659 C'mon people.
35660 If you haven't checked Bacon out- you should.
35661 After all- what's not to like about, Bacon?
35662 What can I say ?
35663 This is awesome.
35664 I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.
35665 Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.
35666 The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.
35667 Its very fluffy and its done just right.
35668 Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and "old" when they have been sitting for a while.
35669 For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.
35670 I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.
35671 They accept credit cards and discover :)
35672 OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this!
35673 I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons.
35674 Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few "adult" beverages back.
35675 At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing).
35676 Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!)
35677 was D'moes.
35678 Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB).
35679 These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there!
35680 Major props for that.
35681 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying "who ordered pizza" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo.
35682 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome.
35683 Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders).
35684 Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times.
35685 I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out.
35686 Maybe he had a slice with us?
35687 Who really knows these things.
35688 However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember.
35689 It was pretty darn good.
35690 Between the awesome'ness that is called "their customer service" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?...
35691 hmmmm....
35692 Potential there....
35693 I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates.
35694 BAD CALL!
35695 Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it.
35696 If I wasn't locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now.
35697 Internet: I signed up for their "Heavy Duty" internet @ 20 Mbps.
35698 I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com.
35699 The best I have ever seen is a little over 5.
35700 When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds.
35701 That is why they advertise "up to" 20 Mbps...
35702 Phone: Extremely poor sound quality, very loud static and crackling, shocking as this is what they should be good at.
35703 I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it.
35704 This was the day after install!!
35705 Helpful hint, call back and tell them you want to cancel your account.
35706 The customer loyalty group is actually decent, they sent out a tech free of charge.
35707 He fixed it after a couple of hours, but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line...
35708 The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...
35709 I went with a bundled package (phone, cable, internet).
35710 The plan I signed up for was $147 a month.
35711 The first bill was $147, the second bill in I'm at $272.43.
35712 I can't make any sense out of the bill so I'm not sure why they think i owe this much.
35713 I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools.
35714 The day this contract is up I'm going back to Cox and I'll be happy to pay more!
35715 !
35716 I've been boycotting this store since 2009.
35717 One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.
35718 I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.
35719 She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).
35720 The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.
35721 Avoid like the plague.
35722 Went here one night with a group of friends.
35723 This place is pink, crowded, and really not that impressive.
35724 I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.
35725 The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?)
35726 and the tables were the wrong height for eating.
35727 I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.
35728 I'll avoid going here again.
35729 The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie.
35730 This is my favorite fine dining in town.
35731 I only go here 2 or 3 times a year because it's a little pricey for dinner, but wow, what great food!
35732 Dessert is awesome here too, love the Sundae.
35733 I just went here for my birthday last week and it still lives up to expectations although they don't carry my favorite anymore (double cut grilled pork chop).
35734 They might start carrying it after they move to their new location though, here's hoping!
35735 If you're looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended, just please dress accordingly and don't try wearing a hat, not allowed!
35736 This is a real find and I mean "find"  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale.
35737 This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.
35738 The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.
35739 The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.
35740 My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.
35741 Definitely worth the trip.
35742 I don't get it.
35743 This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour.
35744 No name tags on the employees.
35745 I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled.
35746 I guess I violated the health code.
35747 Thanks for not locking me up.
35748 I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
35749 Lee Lee's finally expanded from their Chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop.
35750 Low prices, huge selection, and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true Asian market (i.e., wherever you are, you will never escape the smell of fish).
35751 I love it.
35752 I bought ingredients for Vietnamese spring rolls, two different kinds of curries, a new motor/pestle, a Vietnamese coffee press, and some various other vegetables and liquors... hardly anything.
35753 Also, the seafood, while I didn't purchase any, looks very fresh.
35754 Wonderful to see such a great addition to west Phoenix.
35755 I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ.
35756 What is there to say that hasn't already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.
35757 Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.
35758 Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!
35759 I am in love with Yogurtland fro yo!!
35760 It is super delicious and inexpensive!!
35761 I got the coconut and added shredded coconut and mochi pieces...yummm.
35762 Can't wait to go back.
35763 I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon.
35764 I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought I'd try a new place and I am SO glad I did.
35765 The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals.
35766 Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home.
35767 You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors).
35768 She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way).
35769 She's to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help.
35770 They keep track of the previous cut that was given (it's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time).
35771 I would highly recommend this pet salon.
35772 They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding.
35773 I can't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more!
35774 Can't go wrong at this salon..
35775 A roadtrip would not be complete without local BBQ and Bobby's does not disappoint!
35776 Fancy smancy table service
35777 Dark and cool with bar seating
35778 Rotisserie chick and bragging about the ribs.
35779 Alex was friendly and rattled off drink specials.
35780 Other servers were chatting with friends at the bar and one, blond one dipped into her cleavage for something.
35781 I hope she washes her hands before serving up a meal.
35782 Now I look around, this is a breaking ground for hooters.
35783 Low cut and falling out.
35784 Not a fan of that.
35785 Bobby Q Amber Ale (Sonoran Brewing) is too light with a bitter bite.
35786 Not my type of amber but they tried.
35787 2 meats, brisket & sausage w/ mac&cheese and...the pecan coleslaw?
35788 What the heck for $18.
35789 Pulled pork sandwich $10
35790 2 meat with pork and brisket
35791 Ranch House Salad
35792 Corn bread (pucks) of sweet, warm goodness.
35793 Sides were great!
35794 The beans with zest, the M&C takes me back to old school cafeteria, the potato salad was fantastic and the slaw was great with the pecan.
35795 Brisket was the clear winner from the table and we all loved the smoky sausage.
35796 The pulled pork was a disappointing third as it was dry.
35797 Good thing I went with brisket.
35798 Two thumbs up here kids.
35799 Well worth your time and money.
35800 Yelp check in brought a 10% off the total tab too.
35801 Say hello to the Ghost Lounge, folks.
35802 This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership.
35803 For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue.
35804 With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene.
35805 This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened.
35806 If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here.
35807 (Or else the near-by Westward Ho).
35808 You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix.
35809 So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions.
35810 Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was "air-cooled."
35811 (That may have meant it had swamp coolers.
35812 I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)
35813 I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day).
35814 It has been beautifully done.
35815 I will be back often.
35816 Saigon Pho doesn't have a fancy sign, great decor or even windows you can look in/out of.
35817 But who cares when you have the most amazing Pho in the valley (and at the best prices)?
35818 The servings are very big and everything averages about $6 a plate.
35819 Staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods.
35820 As you can read through the various other reviews - everyone has a favorite dish.
35821 I have a problem with gluttony so I can't suggest a single dish - I can only suggest them all.
35822 However, this place also has some of the best Salt and Pepper calamari I've ever had.
35823 Great staff without an attitude (which is rare in Scottsdale).
35824 As I was waiting for my party to arrive, I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food.
35825 Without ANY questions and/or hassle, my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived.
35826 Not only that, but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so.
35827 OK, how great is that?
35828 I am totally sold on the service there an  I will definitely come back.
35829 Very nice unpretentious place.
35830 I'll never forget my first Urban Cookie.
35831 I was checking out after a successful day of shopping at Frances (my favorite boutique), when the girl behind the counter offered me some cookies they had out on a tray.
35832 I hesitated at first (because I was worried about fitting the new skinny jeans I had just bought) but gave in after little persuasion.
35833 It was love at first bite.
35834 After buying my jeans, I rushed immediately to Urban Cookie and bought one of every kind.
35835 Although it was close, Urban Trail was my favorite.
35836 I really can't help myself, I keep going back for more (plus the owner is super cute).
35837 I love urban cookie!
35838 This is thee place to indulge your sweet tooth.
35839 Great ice cream and ice cream creations from an establishment with deep roots and long pedigree in the ice cream biz.
35840 Just can't be beat.
35841 Another visit:
35842 Greeeeeeat carne asada tacos, torta and that orange cake!
35843 Quesadillas, pork and chicken, were a great balance of cheese, meat and sauce.
35844 That orange cake though?!
35845 Like, I am one of those people that would do ...things for good carrot cake, and the basic format of carrot cake done with oranges, cream cheese icing and all, was a wonderful flavor surprise.
35846 Gallo Blanco looks like a top contender for Places to Take Visitors.
35847 Just a very well rounded place to give visitors a taste of good eats in Phoenix and examples of well done and delish Mexican cuisine.
35848 Yummy!
35849 My girlfriend i love, love, love this place.
35850 Excellent food, beers, and wine to enjoy on premises.
35851 Friendly, helpful, and funny staff.
35852 A wonderful grocery to shop from, and an amazing selection of cheese and wine.
35853 It's a total foodie destination.
35854 This place is fantastic.
35855 Ahwahtukee (and Phoenix in general) needs more quality driven, food and wine centric places like this.
35856 I love Honey Bear's!
35857 I've been visiting their restaurants for years.
35858 I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.
35859 They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!
35860 I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.
35861 When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me.
35862 My favorite place in the world to eat!
35863 Great service and awesome food!
35864 Love this place!
35865 I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon.
35866 The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside.
35867 First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy.
35868 There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs.
35869 I actually have been here twice so far.
35870 First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists.
35871 The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend.
35872 The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels.
35873 All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced.
35874 The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day.
35875 The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl.
35876 The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips.
35877 The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves.
35878 Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find.
35879 The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice.
35880 My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table.
35881 Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled.
35882 All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer.
35883 We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie.
35884 A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform.
35885 He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket.
35886 I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese.
35887 After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking.
35888 RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu.
35889 If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!
35890 This is one of my favorite places to eat when I get back to town.
35891 Their beans are the best I've had.
35892 Their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside.
35893 This makes the best product.
35894 All of you lucky enough to live in the state don't realize how lucky you are to have this treat!
35895 I'm usually not an enchilada fan, but you have to try one here.
35896 Some of the reviews comment on decor.
35897 While it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles, I would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china.
35898 And that salsa, I really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles, but then I'd have to check it in my bag to go back home!
35899 The line was ridiculous.
35900 The price is kind of steep for what it is.
35901 The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.
35902 But you know what?
35903 I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!
35904 Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.
35905 This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.
35906 I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.
35907 I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.
35908 While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.
35909 I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.
35910 While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.
35911 Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic.
35912 I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.
35913 And I didn't even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!
35914 The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome.
35915 Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50, with matching envelopes.
35916 Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance.
35917 Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine.
35918 When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just $10 and hour with printing priveleges.
35919 I went to Z Tejas with a bunch of people (about 25) last night.
35920 We had a great experience from start to finish.
35921 At the beginning my lady and I were early so the waiter got us our drinks and continued to make sure we were good to go.
35922 We wanted to wait for our friends so food wasn't necessary at this time, but the drinks were flowing and the waiter (Jeff) was very cool, friendly, and down to earth.
35923 All of our friends showed up and we let the good times roll.
35924 Chips and salsa, drinks, water, and the delicious cornbread, they all came very fast and it didn't take any begging on our part.
35925 I got a chicken dish which was really good, I stuffed myself silly.
35926 My lady got a side salad which was huge, she couldn't even finish it and she said it was really good.
35927 Oh!
35928 and the food came fast by the way (surprising when you have 25 people.
35929 The overall vibe of the place is really cool, very trendy and fancy but reasonable prices.
35930 Big screens everywhere, gotta love that since there were some great College FB games on last night.
35931 Great experience, thanks Jeff & Z Tejas.
35932 Amazing food.
35933 I wasn't so sure about Indian food, as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself.
35934 I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala and it was fantastic.
35935 I can't wait to go back!
35936 This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - don't let the looks fool you, it is delicious!
35937 I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.
35938 Highly recommended
35939 Great food!
35940 Great atmosphere!
35941 Great service.
35942 Definitely recommend!
35943 !
35944 This is a dangerous place for me.
35945 I could seriously do my bank account some damage as I love love love this store!
35946 The candles are the best anywhere.
35947 They burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out.
35948 I just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish.
35949 There's so many cool home furnishings here as well, unique non-mainstream stuff that's fairly reasonable in $$.
35950 I've actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet... purchasing it may be in my very near future!
35951 The consummate beer bar.
35952 Great selection, knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons.
35953 What more can you want from a drinking establishment?
35954 The food is good too.
35955 Service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy.
35956 Price and selection are awesome too!
35957 I have played this course two times now.
35958 From the moment you pull up, you feel like you are at a private course.
35959 The staff is very friendly and professional.
35960 The views are breathtaking and both times I have played, the course has been in impecable shape!
35961 The course is challenging, but still enjoyable.
35962 Lots of holes that are down hill (great for long tee shots!).
35963 This is one of my favorite courses in the area!
35964 I liked this place.
35965 The reviews show low stars but I liked it.
35966 I was there for happy hour so go at that time.
35967 The pricing is good.
35968 I don't know about dinner, but happy hour is cool.
35969 Servers were chill.
35970 Host was a bit stuck up.
35971 Not sure why she though she was that great.
35972 But the place is cool.
35973 I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe.
35974 My g/f love sushi!
35975 She made me a connosiuer of it.
35976 and I have to be critical.
35977 So many college kids "love" RA, but it's mediocre at best.
35978 I'll just list a few things that irk me:
35979 I went during a happy hour with co-workers.
35980 It was PACKED.
35981 Good thing, right?
35982 WRONG!
35983 Extremely poor service.
35984 when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait.
35985 When I said I have a table, she got in my face.
35986 I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill.
35987 I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone.
35988 The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW!
35989 I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber.
35990 their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!
35991 Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.
35992 Just an overall poor experience.
35993 and I tip on service.
35994 Food quality was so-so.
35995 Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high.
35996 I love this gym!
35997 Everyone is so helpful and friendly.
35998 The gym has a TON of equipment and is always very well kept and clean.
35999 I wouldn't want to go anywhere else.
36000 I feel very well connected to all of the staff - they even know me by name!
36001 The trainers are extremely helpful also.
36002 I would recommend this gym to anyone and everyone!
36003 Kick @$$ The Best of the bertos & they will make anything you want_!!
36004 Carne Asada with Sausage & Ham........Wow..
36005 I love this place!
36006 It first caught my eye driving to work.
36007 Their logo includes a shazzam lighting bolt which is rad if your into comics.
36008 I went in the place and they had comic art on the walls.
36009 The staff made some suggestions of what I should try.
36010 I got the slider pizza - (kinda like a cheese burger pizza) they actually used a little brown mustard on top.
36011 Anyway it was delicious.
36012 I can't get over the helpful staff though.
36013 It is very rare that I get that kind of service at a pizza joint.
36014 Any way every time I have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it isn't going to be around long.
36015 If you get the change PLEASE check this place out.
36016 Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.
36017 Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).
36018 I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.
36019 Nom nom.
36020 Friendly staff.
36021 See ya there!
36022 Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.75 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less 4 dollars.
36023 half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough.
36024 Its a great pick me up for something sweet on mill
36025 Cookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice.
36026 Place is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies.
36027 Recommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches
36028 Bad food, but lots of it.
36029 If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.
36030 Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!
36031 Stopped in for Margs and appetizers.
36032 Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK?
36033 Holy MOLY what do they put in those things?
36034 Food was great, drinks were better, I'll be back!
36035 You can't give anything less than 5 stars to a place that sells bra's and panties to hot chicks.
36036 I've been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations: Fresh.
36037 Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh.
36038 We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad.
36039 The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit.
36040 We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great.
36041 The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.
36042 We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel.
36043 Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place.
36044 Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit.
36045 We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order.
36046 We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal.
36047 We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us.
36048 The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box.
36049 You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust.
36050 The gravy was watered, missing favor.
36051 Corn bread was over cooked under salted.
36052 The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread.
36053 I felt like we received the leftovers.
36054 Truly the worst service we ever received.
36055 The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.
36056 Best donuts in the valley.
36057 I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.
36058 Never too heavy, always tasting fresh.
36059 Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots (rosemary & garlic).
36060 Gutsy sauce was utterly unique!
36061 Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service.
36062 I think everyone has said most everything that needs to be said about this place.
36063 But I'll highlight the reasons I frequent Switch...
36064 free wi-fi
36065 good drinks
36066 $5 recession plate special - that is always as awesome as the rest of their menu
36067 good happy hour specials
36068 open til 11pm 7 days a week
36069 good wine
36070 great/friendly wait staff
36071 their salads are out of control - amazing.
36072 i think i could happily support/invest in switch/fez/ticoz dynasty for all of eternity...if i had the means.
36073 Fast, friendly, and clean.
36074 You don't get to say that too often when describing a post office!
36075 Serously though, these guys are great.
36076 Papago Park is a great place to ride (bicycles, that is).
36077 The terrain can be as easy or as hard as you'd like-- just choose your trail!
36078 Ordered the famous "Butter Burger" medium rare.
36079 Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through.
36080 Delicious!
36081 Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.
36082 Happy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider.
36083 My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flo's on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd.
36084 25 miles isn't too far for this food.
36085 We've been eating here since the 90's and have always been pleased.
36086 I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch, it was so busy.
36087 Our favorites: Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I can't think of anything I wouldn't order.
36088 "Yogurtland" as I say it with a high-pitched tone in the end..
36089 This is my ultimate favorite dessert!!
36090 I would give 10 stars if Yelp allows it!
36091 All my friends know that I am attached to this place!
36092 We started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball game...and all I said after first walking in was, "This is fun!!"
36093 and we got hooked eversince!!
36094 That I collect their spoons, only used by me and the hubbie, and I now have 5 YGL  cups full of spoons!!
36095 I am the ultimate Yogurtland addict!!
36096 heehee We go as often as 5 times a week that we already know the staff in this location.
36097 And we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for Lent just to see if we can resist it!!
36098 haha Most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my YGL addiction..and so far nothing has won over it yet..=D
36099 So, my favorite flavors are Taro, Pistachio and Toasted Coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors, Pumpkin Pie, Gingerbread..Oh I wanna go now just thinking about it!
36100 My favorite toppings are the yogurt chips, sugar cone, sunflower seeds, shredded coconut and graham!!
36101 =) Perfect blend of flavors!
36102 So if you haven't tried it yet, grab your favorite partner and enjoy some "Yogurtland"...=)
36103 Sara (bartender) is the hottest chick in the world!
36104 !
36105 I love love this store!!
36106 Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for.
36107 The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy!
36108 My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals.
36109 Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!!
36110 The employees are extremely nice and helpful.
36111 I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!
36112 !
36113 I rarely go to Indian restaurants.
36114 But this is a place I love to visit often.
36115 The food seems as if it was done with great interest.
36116 When u go there, order anything with rice.
36117 They cook it to perfection.
36118 I like their handi dishes a lot.
36119 If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes.
36120 No need to guild this Lilly!
36121 I am a vegetarian and there is a ton of great stuff at Pita Jungle.
36122 I just had the hummus trio, babaganoush, dolmas, mozzarella, and feta for appetizers tonight.
36123 Fantastic happy hour on the apps and delicious.
36124 Took BLACK BEAN BURGER to go.
36125 SOOOO good!
36126 Also, servers are super nice and prompt.
36127 YAY!
36128 All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get.
36129 and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat.
36130 I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler.
36131 Esp.
36132 if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.
36133 It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.
36134 And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)!
36135 Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.
36136 She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.
36137 I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!
36138 If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.
36139 They are so excited to help you!
36140 If you've never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out.
36141 I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place.
36142 I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house.
36143 If you've never heard of it, this is how it goes down.
36144 It's a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of "sauce" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey.
36145 You mix it all together and there you have it.
36146 A somewhat healthy dessert!
36147 They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =)
36148 This place isn't just all about the bingsoo though.
36149 They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!
36150 Went here last night when on our last night staying at the Hotel Valley Ho.
36151 We were able to walk there from the hotel and it was so cute.
36152 The wait staff were helpful and gracious.
36153 Once we saw how large the pizzas were, they accomodated us and split the toppings on each side of the pizza so we got what we wanted.
36154 I did think the olives were really salty, but that's that type of olive.
36155 We had delicious wine and the bruschetta sampler.
36156 Enjoy people!
36157 I have to tell you....
36158 I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy!
36159 You gotta try it!
36160 I love this place the more I go to it!
36161 The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo.
36162 Holy schneikies it's good!!!
36163 Can't beat the prices either!
36164 If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!
36165 !
36166 Quick, friendly, awesome.
36167 we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us.
36168 I've lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed, it's quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by.
36169 The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive.
36170 We felt so taken care of!!
36171 :)
36172 I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was "WHOAH!".
36173 The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover.
36174 The food was fresh, the meat tender, the atmosphere pleasantly divine!
36175 2 trips now and I'm such a fan!
36176 :D
36177 We love The Olive Tree!
36178 We call it 'the grill' We eat there at least once a week - my littlest one has swim lessons right next door.
36179 Both my picky eaters love eating there!
36180 We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma(sp?).
36181 Family ran, great food we love it!
36182 Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda.
36183 Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good.
36184 There.
36185 I'm not being a total jerk.
36186 The food, however, left much to be desired.
36187 I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico.
36188 What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans.
36189 Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing.
36190 Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!)
36191 on top, but come on.
36192 $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine?
36193 For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad.
36194 Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?
36195 The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different.
36196 The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans.
36197 the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side.
36198 I think my cat's food bowl is bigger.
36199 They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips.
36200 I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle.
36201 I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse.
36202 Needless to say, I won't be going back.
36203 There are far better choices closer to home.
36204 10:30pm on a Saturday night.
36205 My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).
36206 Place is hopping.
36207 We take a seat at the sushi bar.
36208 The Waitress:  "Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?"
36209 Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, "yes."
36210 Waitress:  "Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too."
36211 Me: What the fuck, bitch.
36212 "Uh, ok"
36213 Dear Ra Waitress,
36214 I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.
36215 It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.
36216 I was hardly the last customer in there.
36217 There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.
36218 If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?
36219 Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.
36220 I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.
36221 Thanks for that.
36222 Sincerely,
36223 Morgan
36224 Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be.
36225 I love, love, love their croissants.
36226 But which bakery's croissants do I not love?
36227 hmm...
36228 But I do love theirs.
36229 I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant.
36230 It was just freaking amazing.
36231 That's all I can say.
36232 (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)
36233 I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff.
36234 The portion is very small compared to the price.
36235 Their macaroons look crazy and funky.
36236 Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time.
36237 I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird.
36238 But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery.
36239 They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants.
36240 Wow.
36241 Went early  to North for the New Year's eve special menu.
36242 3rd time dining here.
36243 They did not have to have great service or food on a yearly event, but as with the previous meals, it was outstanding.
36244 Hubby had the misto fritto, they always do the crisp calamari perfect.
36245 Enough just to make a special trip for it.
36246 I had the beef carpaccio, buttery and flavorful.
36247 The apple cider pork tenderloin was tender, moist and it was a huge portion.
36248 My hubby was stuffed but did not stop eating until it was all gone.
36249 Oink.
36250 I had the scallops.
36251 Always a favorite of mine.
36252 They usually have it on the menu and often in a variation as a special.
36253 We both had the hazelnut chocolate cake.
36254 Sinfully rich.
36255 We were both too full to eat but a bite and finished at home for the New Year's countdown.
36256 We really enjoy our dining at North and have been very fortunate at several other Fox restaurants.
36257 I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, "Woohoo!
36258 As good as it gets!"
36259 I say to what's available of what I've seen in PHX area.
36260 With that said, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor.
36261 The only thing that didn't rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches- can't vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either.
36262 Besides that, If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area.
36263 Staff was quick and efficient.
36264 Food was delicious.
36265 I tired they chicken smash burger....
36266 WOOHOO!!!
36267 LOVE IT!
36268 Crispy chicken (not too think, not too thick) but perfectly crispy.
36269 I ordered the build your own:  Egg bun, crispy chicken, mayo, and swiss cheese.
36270 HELLO MAMA!
36271 The smash fries were good.
36272 The staff is always friendly.
36273 My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL.
36274 That could sum up the whole trip.
36275 I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all.
36276 I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.
36277 I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes.
36278 So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side.
36279 The boolgogee, plain, simply plain.
36280 There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain.
36281 There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.
36282 Oh, the sushi?
36283 All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy.
36284 By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming.
36285 I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got.
36286 After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite.
36287 We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.
36288 This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion.
36289 Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag.
36290 The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting.
36291 I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food.
36292 My wife swears by the carne asado tacos; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell.
36293 Although I phone in my order, the parking lot is always an adventure.
36294 However, the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant's limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients.
36295 Pei Wei's has nothing on the fabulous food at TOTTS  The menu is awesome -- try anything!!
36296 The owner, Young, is such a nice man and will always help you understand the menu or make recommendations.
36297 In fact, one time we told him we wished a certain dish was spicier (we really like hotttt food), and he told us to just ask next time we were in and they would make it spicier.
36298 Everything on the menu is fabulous, but some of my favorites are:
36299 Sweet and Pungent Chicken -- all time favorite
36300 Bourban Chicken
36301 Twins Pork
36302 As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them.
36303 I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right.
36304 I mean, I'm always right.
36305 By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten.
36306 This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch.
36307 I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me.
36308 I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.
36309 They listened.
36310 They created.
36311 They named.
36312 (after me!!!)
36313 We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker.
36314 He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet!
36315 I'm already a star!
36316 So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler?
36317 Amazing.
36318 Seriously.
36319 The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes.
36320 They bring such a delicious flavor!
36321 It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.
36322 I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas!
36323 If you know whats good for you, you will too.
36324 I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it.
36325 It was horrible on Saturday night (5/28).
36326 I ordered the enchiladas with chicken.
36327 When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the "with" chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top.
36328 I was so disappointed, but starving so I ate it.
36329 The guacamole was really disappointing too.
36330 I don't think we will go back again.
36331 NO.
36332 Don't go.
36333 Don't do it.
36334 This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.
36335 One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.
36336 I promise it will be better than this.
36337 If you like sushi, go somewhere else.
36338 I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food.
36339 I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however, either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.
36340 The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through.
36341 We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice.
36342 The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen!
36343 Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve.
36344 I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named "Climax."
36345 Gross and just distasteful.
36346 The decor and ambiance leave you wanting.
36347 They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming.
36348 Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise, I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi.
36349 I've been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience I've had.
36350 It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks.
36351 My friend called ahead and made a reservation.
36352 When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs.
36353 Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick.
36354 They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food.
36355 Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it'll keep me coming back.
36356 See ya next Sunday, Majerle's!
36357 Aside from the Macy's on 34th street in NY, this one is my favorite store.
36358 They carry all my favorite designers, especially for work clothes.
36359 Not to mention, the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps.
36360 There's a tiny Ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department, I love her, she is SO patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes.
36361 I wanna meet the buyer for this store and become her/his bestie.
36362 They also have a personal shopper near the women's dressing rooms.
36363 Not that I'd ever have the need for one but you might.
36364 The sales people are always really nice and helpful.
36365 On a side note: I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here.
36366 I've always doubted that story but it never fails that when I go to the lingerie department I tell myself "I'm standing where the late great Janis stood."
36367 She's one of my all times.
36368 Toasted subs at their best..
36369 The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks.
36370 And in the fall when they bring out the soups, I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal.
36371 First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning.
36372 Me, my bf, and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience.
36373 You can choose between the active or passive dog park.
36374 We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all.
36375 We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers, very friendly.
36376 We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way.
36377 We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm, no foul.
36378 Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again!
36379 My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out.
36380 We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.
36381 Still no-one offered to take our drink order.
36382 The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us.
36383 We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating.
36384 The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.)
36385 We finally got up and left.
36386 Why waste money on places that won't take it!
36387 I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!
36388 I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which provides it a cozier feel than the other two.
36389 Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at, as long as someone else drives, of course.
36390 The tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales.
36391 If you get them with veggies, you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish, so I recommend some other topping.
36392 The beef is fantastic (especially in the tacos).
36393 All in all, this is one of my current favorites.
36394 I love-love-love Green.
36395 The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better.
36396 The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful.
36397 There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support.
36398 I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint.
36399 The staff is friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is lovely.
36400 My favorites - the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese.
36401 I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again!
36402 Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful.
36403 What a fun night, feeling "Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant.
36404 Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW.
36405 My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic.
36406 Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine.
36407 When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server.
36408 She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night.
36409 Thanks
36410 Fable III used AND looks brand new for $11?!
36411 OH YEAH!
36412 I'll take it!
36413 I stumbled upon this place because our little cousin wanted to get a game, and he had been here before with his aunt.
36414 The place was filled with classic games all over the walls and even to play.
36415 I'm guessing classic original games are back and in style again.
36416 Plus they are just fun to try or have a flashback from the 80s.
36417 The store is clean, open aisles to walk through, great prices on the games and the customer service from Gary and Rich is phenomenal.
36418 These guys were very nice, educated about the games, and went out of there way to make everyone happy.
36419 Great job guys!
36420 :)
36421 All the high star reviews are true!
36422 This place is SO much better than any other gaming place I've been too.
36423 My husband loved it too.
36424 He was a kid in a candy store.
36425 What a great find!
36426 I think you should take a trip to this store, even if you don't play.
36427 Get a game as a gift.
36428 Just to experience this place, it is something special and unique.
36429 I love this place I have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame.
36430 I hope that I can volunteer here.
36431 Loved it.
36432 Food was great, service was great.
36433 Not easy to find, but worth the search!!
36434 !
36435 I'm giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review, because although it has its share of hits and misses, it is, in fact, as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue.
36436 I love barbecue.
36437 It is a hobby of mine.
36438 When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed.
36439 Most recently, this happened with beef brisket.
36440 I'm going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Q's brisket because seriously, if you look at it and don't want to immediately die from desire, then you just don't like barbecue.
36441 If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm.
36442 Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.
36443 Their prices are too high, but of course, you're paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere.
36444 Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they don't understand what "spicy" means).
36445 All in all I really can't say enough good things about this place.
36446 Go look at my brisket photo.
36447 Seriously.
36448 Headed back to Lobby's.
36449 How I missed this tasty burger.
36450 I wasn't disappointed with round 2.
36451 The burger was still fantastic!
36452 I'm also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip.
36453 With any burger purchase, getting the combo pack (fries/soda) is the smart choice.
36454 I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.
36455 Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down.
36456 The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun.
36457 That's a good thing in my opinion!
36458 Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!
36459 Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!
36460 Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation.
36461 There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.
36462 Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day.
36463 Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.
36464 I told one of the employess and he says "I know dude".
36465 It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping.
36466 Burger was over-priced.
36467 Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.
36468 Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?
36469 Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility, because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time.

36472 Double Double Animal Style.
36473 It is worth the trip cross country.
36474 Well maybe not, but I do enjoy them while I am visiting.
36475 I cannot get enough of them.

36477 The private stalled restrooms are always spotless and stocked.
36478 4 Flushes.
36479 Soft opening, so still working out the kinks.
36480 Food was deelish.
36481 Scallop poppers- crispy and spicy; not at all greasy
36482 Honey chicken-a little sticky but so good
36483 Teriyaki chicken-subtler than other places' teriyaki, but much better flavor and chicken was tender
36484 "tootzi" roll- bursting with flavor and rolled perfectly
36485 Nice touches with cucumber water, upscale Asian decor, unique glasses, menus, plates, etc.
36486 Will definitely be back.
36487 By far the best Mexican food in Scottsdale!
36488 Food and Salsa amazing!
36489 Service phenomenal!
36490 Great prices!!!
36491 !
36492 As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery!
36493 Truly a "hidden gem" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me.
36494 I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts.
36495 I am always upset when I visit and I can't stop by this gallery-and don't miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration.
36496 Splleeeendid.
36497 This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything I've sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.
36498 If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles - yum!
36499 ).
36500 Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.
36501 Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).
36502 They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal.
36503 Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).
36504 This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes.
36505 Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).
36506 Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.
36507 Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!
36508 We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.
36509 Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.
36510 My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.
36511 Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.
36512 The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.
36513 Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.
36514 Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.
36515 Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.
36516 One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.
36517 I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.
36518 All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.
36519 Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!
36520 Highly, highly recommended.
36521 When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed!
36522 I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!
36523 The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans.
36524 I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada.
36525 I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese!
36526 The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.
36527 The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited.
36528 The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance.
36529 Still, one of my faves!
36530 Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine.
36531 Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll.
36532 All of it was to die for.
36533 A little Gem.
36534 Pricing is competitive not high or low.
36535 Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information.
36536 Been here twice now and tried two different dogs and two sides.
36537 Nothing was disappointing.
36538 I have tried both the sweet and spicy dog and the hana dog.
36539 Both dogs were great and had very distinct high points.
36540 The sweet and spicy does something very rare for me and actually gets me to enjoy pineapple mixed with other foods.
36541 I this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat.
36542 The hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair.
36543 The bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth.
36544 The sides were good to.
36545 The chili is not some canned stuff and is good.
36546 The tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave.
36547 If you want a gourmet hot dog this place is not going to let you down.
36548 AWFUL.
36549 Not sure it classifies as food.
36550 Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.
36551 No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.
36552 Nada.
36553 Plus they won't let you add anything to it.
36554 Everything is as is.
36555 The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.
36556 The food was barely luke warm.
36557 Service is also mediocre.
36558 The salsa was gross.
36559 It was super water down.
36560 The best part of the meal was my Pepsi.
36561 Best Cakes around!
36562 This may sound crazy, but I've never actually been in this place.
36563 But I've tried so many different things they have.
36564 My job goes through Karsh's for all the anniversary cakes, catering, and special events.
36565 We get cookies, cakes, and other assorted pieces of heaven from Karsh's.
36566 Recently, my coworkers wanted to try something different.
36567 They got an eclaire, cake balls, and mini rainbow cakes.
36568 The rainbow cakes are the best thing to ever go in my mouth.
36569 I could eat those for days.
36570 They just melt in your mouth plus they're covered with chocolate.
36571 What?
36572 Yes!
36573 My friends also got me a Karsh's cake for my birthday a few years ago.
36574 I wish I had a picture of it.
36575 It was so pretty with a butterfly on it.
36576 And it tasted amazing.
36577 Though I've never been a paying customer and I've never walked through their door, I love this place and highly recommend it for any event you may be throwing.
36578 This place does not disappoint.
36579 I've been here quite a few times with coworkers and it's always a good choice.
36580 Cute place - I especially like sitting on their cozy, covered patio.
36581 I hate mushrooms but somehow LOVE their fungi pizza.
36582 I think it's the truffle oil that makes it amazing.
36583 I've had a few of their other pizzas too, which are quite good as well.
36584 All of their salads are delish - you can't go wrong with any of them.
36585 If there's just one other person with you, you can't go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad.
36586 This place is WAY better than Pizzeria Bianco.
36587 Will continue to come back here!
36588 I'm not generally a big fan of burgers, but I love this place!
36589 Their "blu burger" is amazing!
36590 Bleu cheese crumbles, carmelized onions and thick, crispy bacon on an awesome onion bun, oh my!
36591 I highly recommend adding avocado to it as well.
36592 I can't speak for the other sandwiches because I love the blu burger too much to order anything new.
36593 Heh.
36594 The zucchini fries are a thing of beauty AND they allow well-behaved dogs to hang out with you on the patio while you enjoy your meal.
36595 They even brought my little guy a disposable water bowl!
36596 I've also had great luck with their waitstaff, everyone is friendly and on task.
36597 It's pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night, but just perfect for a Saturday afternoon lunch.
36598 THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!
36599 It really deserves NO STARS!!
36600 !
36601 You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food.
36602 What I tried...
36603 Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.
36604 Spicy but has no flavor.
36605 Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?
36606 You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.
36607 They use the cheapest cuts of meat.
36608 This item was on their Daily Special.
36609 Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.
36610 You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!
36611 Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.
36612 How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?
36613 Service stinks.
36614 I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.
36615 The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.
36616 Vegetable platter was not fresh.
36617 Bean sprouts were starting to brown.
36618 If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.
36619 I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.
36620 This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.
36621 Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones.
36622 My favorite sushi restaurant ever!
36623 I love their ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) and always craving for more.
36624 For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll (with asparagus inside) and it was so delicious makes me craving for more.
36625 The pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth!
36626 What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb!
36627 They ran out ama ebi and I told the waitress that one of the reason I came there is for that ama ebi.
36628 The chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me!!!
36629 What a service!!!!
36630 I'm so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer!!
36631 Love this place so much!
36632 !
36633 Horrible service.
36634 I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!
36635 When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold.
36636 The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy.
36637 The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse.
36638 The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon.
36639 Really?
36640 It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless.
36641 There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere.
36642 I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.
36643 For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub.
36644 Adios, cowboy.
36645 Love it, love it, love it!
36646 I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didn't love.
36647 My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really can't go wrong!
36648 The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing!
36649 Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it.
36650 The prices are fair and the portions are huge!
36651 Don't be afraid to split a dish with a loved one.
36652 I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence.
36653 I have not needed her service's and most of us don't plan on needing an attorney.
36654 But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions.
36655 "People in crisis need company, Droban & Company".
36656 How very true.
36657 When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL.
36658 You will need good company.
36659 I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you.
36660 We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful.
36661 The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters.
36662 The service was outstanding.
36663 The food was delicious.
36664 I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven.
36665 Everyone else enjoyed their food.
36666 The eggs benedict came out perfect.
36667 The BLT looked awesome.
36668 The fries were delicious.
36669 We will definitely be back.
36670 I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment
36671 I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years
36672 I've lived all over the world
36673 I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)
36674 1.
36675 Skim Milk
36676 2.
36677 Mexican food
36678 3.
36679 Tokyo Express
36680 Now pay attention
36681 If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order
36682 An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
36683 5 extra sides of spicy sauce
36684 A small salad
36685 2 extra sides of salad dressing
36686 Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.
36687 Really.
36688 This place makes me want to cry I love it so much.
36689 Cork is an enigma.
36690 What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.
36691 The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs.
36692 and I was satisfied).
36693 If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.
36694 I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.
36695 The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.
36696 I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more "simple" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.
36697 Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.
36698 The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?
36699 The wine selection is top notch.
36700 the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.
36701 make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.
36702 Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!
36703 Went to Yogurt Kingdom for the first time tonight.
36704 It was perfect.
36705 Lots of flavors to choose from.
36706 My favorite is the Tart Vanilla.
36707 But I got a large cup and tasted at least 8 different flavors and I enjoyed each and everyone.
36708 I wanted to go back and get some more of the Tart Vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when I suggested it.
36709 You can either eat inside or outside.
36710 The place is decorated so cute.
36711 There was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before.
36712 They offered to give us any samples that we might like to try.
36713 There was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner.
36714 He was very kind, friendly person  and glad that we stopped in.
36715 The bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained.
36716 We will be back very soon.
36717 I would recommend this place to others that like yogurt.
36718 You won't be disappointed.
36719 I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible,  compare it to (overpriced and bland) Humble Pie, and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted.
36720  I can't vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat.
36721 By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.
36722 I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos.
36723 I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way.
36724 The empanadas are excellent as well.
36725 If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks.
36726 You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks.
36727 Would you like some awesome tortilla soup?
36728 4 bucks.
36729 If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks.
36730 I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?
36731 I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first.
36732 When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias.
36733 Guess how my dining experience went?
36734 Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed.
36735 Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.
36736 I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.
36737 I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it.
36738 But to reiterate:
36739 11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey
36740 happy hour has most items for 4-6$
36741 street tacos are not bursting with meat
36742 ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.
36743 Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door.
36744 For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.
36745 I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar.
36746 LOVE Five Guys!
36747 This is a great Mexican food restaurant.
36748 I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal.
36749 The "Asada y Enchilada" is my favorite dish.
36750 If you are an avocado lover like me,  this is the place to go.
36751 I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere.
36752 "Hipster,Trendy" ???
36753 ?-I think NOT !!!!
36754 Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? )
36755 , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude.
36756 I've given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night , but won't be going back.
36757 So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !
36758 "So Jimmy, tell the class what you saw at Sweeties!"
36759 "OK, well, I saw lots of candy.
36760 Old-timey candy and cool candy and neat candy.
36761 Lots of it.
36762 Real lots."
36763 "And I saw people walking around with baskets and talking about candy.
36764 And talking about candy when they were little.
36765 And talking about what candy they should get for their kids."
36766 "Oh, and I saw Turkish Taffy, Maple Bun Bars, Fruit Stripe Gum, Moon Pies, Cherry Mash, Mary Janes, Valomilk Candy Bars,Sen Sen Packs, Goo Goo Clusters, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Flipstick Lipstick, Licorice Pipes, Zero Bars, Twin Bings, Look Bars, Abba-Zabba Bars and U-No Bars.
36767 And that was only a little of it.
36768 And lots of other stuff."
36769 "Teach?"
36770 "Yes Jimmy?"
36771 "The coolest teacher ever would take her class to Sweeties."
36772 "Would they?"
36773 "Yes."
36774 Standard Mexican fare - but quite delicious.
36775 Pitcher of frozen margaritas was yummy, too.
36776 Fast and friendly service.
36777 My profile says....
36778 My Last Meal On Earth: Chicken and Waffles
36779 Lo Lo's is the reason why.
36780 Everytime I visit Arizona, I make sure I hit this spot up.
36781 I usually order the 'Lo Lo's' meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup.
36782 YUM!
36783 This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar.
36784 There are two locations, one in lower Phoenix, and the other in Scottsdale.
36785 The one in lower Phoenix is the original location.
36786 However, it's much smaller so wait times could vary.
36787 The Scottsdale location is much bigger,  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem.
36788 Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, Lunch and Breakfast please.
36789 Treats: We tried the cookies (chocolate chip and chocolate truffle) and would have to give them 5stars.
36790 Delicious!
36791 Breakfast: Seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor, but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option.
36792 **If you go, be sure to check out the bathrooms.
36793 Each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member, and  the sinks are shared by both genders.
36794 You also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms, so that is a great bonus.
36795 Overall, a great non-chain place for unique and delicious food.
36796 I first joined 24 hr fitness about a year ago, and I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that I came in.
36797 The people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs.
36798 If I ever have a question or concern, it is always promptly answered or dealt with.
36799 Some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as I walk in the door!
36800 It is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience.
36801 :)
36802 On another note, I have been training with Trace for about 6 months now.
36803 My goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body, and I could not be happier with the results!
36804 In 6 months I have lost 12 lbs.
36805 and I look and feel amazing!
36806 He is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition, giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans.
36807 Trace is the total package!
36808 **TIP: Try Trace's boot camp on Wednesday evenings at 7:30.
36809 They will kick your butt!
36810 !
36811 Leah, the trainer, at Dog House Training Academy is great.
36812 She's friendly, knowledgable, and makes herself available via e-mail or phone should you have any questions.
36813 Her knowledge on dogs is extensive, and even though you're just paying for the class, she'll gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog.
36814 The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasn't picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques.
36815 I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer.
36816 She's very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works.
36817 So there are no questions, and it's always made perfect sense to me.
36818 With the quality of service, and the knowledge that you get to tap into while you're training with Leah, you just can't find a better deal out there.
36819 Her rates are competitive, and she offers referral discounts too.
36820 This place is super cute lunch joint.
36821 I had the sloppy joe special and it reminded me of a home cooked meal back in the day.
36822 I ended my meal with a classic vanilla milkshake which was superb.
36823 Oh yeah!
36824 if you're in a hurry for a quick good sit down lunch, this place is it.
36825 our food came out SO fast.
36826 I will be returning shortly.
36827 You also MUST check out the vintage clothing/ furniture in the room next door before you leave !
36828 The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today).
36829 i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch.
36830 A few of my favs are:
36831 - Chicken Salad Sandwich
36832 - Southwest Ranch Salad
36833 - Omelets
36834 Enjoy!
36835 (maybe I'll run into you there)
36836 Wow!
36837 Went on a Sunday around 11am - busy but not packed.
36838 Roomy and comfortable.
36839 GREAT food.
36840 Bacon meaty and tasy.
36841 I had the french toast on recommendation and it was fantastic.
36842 Great atmosphere...just an all around great place.
36843 We were in from LA for a baseball game and wanted a non-chain local place and found this place on Yelp.
36844 Glad we went!
36845 When I lived in Phoenix, I was a regular at Fez.
36846 My friends and I probably averaged twice a week, and there were likely weeks when we were there more.
36847 The atmosphere is really wonderful, a rarity in Phoenix.
36848 The food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful.
36849 I must agree with some of the other reviews, that the waitstaff is very hit-or-miss.
36850 I've had wonderful service and terrible service, and there are times when I've had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order... as regulars, in particular, I wouldn't think that this would be something we would have to deal with.
36851 That being said, there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology... so I haven't personally experienced the attitude that others report.
36852 I miss Fez... now I live in San Diego.
36853 When I go to visit, it's always on the itinerary, every time, usually as soon as I land.
36854 Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!
36855 Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.
36856 I am not an expert on "authentic" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.
36857 We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!
36858 (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.
36859 Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!
36860 My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!
36861 Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.
36862 Now what to eat for dinner.
36863 My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).
36864 I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!
36865 That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named "Best Mole" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!
36866 It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!
36867 Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.
36868 Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.
36869 He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!
36870 !
36871 Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.
36872 The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.
36873 Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.
36874 This is the place for a fabulos breakfast!!
36875 I have friends who visit from Texas and they wait all year to eat the Eggs Benedict here.
36876 They are the best.
36877 I  personally love the pancakes smothered in bannanas, pecans and hot syrup...yummmmy.
36878 They also serve some very healthy and delicious salds for lunch like the strawberry spinach salad and the sandwhiches ar e very good, Their is often a wait for breakfast but it moves fast and their is a community table which sometimes shortens the wait.
36879 Highly recommend.
36880 This is my second time here and I see #3 on the way.
36881 I've had the (bistec encebollado & arroz imperial with shrimp "no melted cheese") I do recommend both plates.
36882 Next time I will try (ropa vieja)
36883 Great service!
36884 Ask for Kelly.
36885 5 stars for the great $5 happy hour specials.
36886 the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks.
36887 My favorite drink is the green tea lemonade--it was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing.
36888 Service was flawless.
36889 We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses, our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well.
36890 We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!
36891 We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.
36892 Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.
36893 Nice eye candy!
36894 I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.
36895 We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.
36896 My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.
36897 Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.
36898 Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!
36899 Salud!
36900 Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast.
36901 Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.
36902 And this time it was the yeast.
36903 I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs!
36904 I am so sick of this crap with this corporation.
36905 Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods.
36906 In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.
36907 Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air.
36908 I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job.
36909 Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist.
36910 But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.
36911 Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores.
36912 It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights.
36913 I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.
36914 Useless motherf*&#$@s!
36915 The food is delicious.
36916 The service:  discriminatory.
36917 The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.
36918 This is embarrassing, I don't know what else to say.
36919 Great food and service!
36920 Country food at its best!
36921 Yes I do rock the hipster joints.
36922 I dig this place.
36923 A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great.
36924 Hard not like it.
36925 All in all a great spot.
36926 I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602.
36927 Only 4 stars?
36928 (A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product.
36929 Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil' harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.)
36930 Anyway, this place rocks.
36931 We aren't super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer.
36932 The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect.
36933 The price of a bag of beans is amazing.
36934 Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast.
36935 This is what is all about!
36936 I have yet to find a better americano.
36937 A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines.
36938 I've been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area, and if I do find myself elsewhere, I can only compare them to Lola, and Lola wins out each time.
36939 I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.
36940 I felt it was necessary in this case.
36941 My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.
36942 The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.
36943 They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.
36944 One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.
36945 The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.
36946 WOW!
36947 This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.
36948 He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.
36949 He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.
36950 It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.
36951 They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.
36952 We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.
36953 He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.
36954 Amazing.
36955 Only in downtown do you meet people like that.
36956 This is a great Subway.
36957 Go here and skip the others.
36958 Let's see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium?
36959 Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that's not a surprise (pun intended) considering you're attending a sporting event...even spring training.
36960 But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here.
36961 Look, you're lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard.
36962 If I could, I'd live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year.
36963 I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team).
36964 Our seats (Sec.
36965 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees).
36966 I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures).
36967 The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players.
36968 The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean.
36969 Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this.
36970 The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful.
36971 I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long.
36972 The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!
36973 ).
36974 I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family.
36975 Oh, Giants won 2-1!
36976 Go Giants!!
36977 !
36978 4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average..
36979 I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite...
36980 The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts"romantic" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List..
