They were in Texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing.	s
Tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with Bryant inhabiting it, and she makes the part significant and interesting.	s
While it was startling to watch this at first, it was nice watching this move along.	s
If I had just seen the pilot of this show I would have rated it a 10.	s
However this was before exploring the DVD's many features!!!!	s
In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywood's perfect wife.	s
Sadly, the film has an uncalled for narration by Matt Damon; a sappy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production.	s
Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (a brother, wife and parents).	s
Also the acting performances are superb - especially Oprah who I now have a new found respect for.	s
Especially, Joan's hysterics are uproarious!	s
When I watch some Hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-budgeted action "fuflo" (a Russian word that means "bull*beep*"), I understand that any *beep* child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute PC effects, and stuff it into the action film.	s
She is close to Lanisha and Maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood.	s
The different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other, identity, desire, limits and loss.	s
I loved this movie and will watch it again.	s
A nice upbeat ending, though a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when the "Mummy" is revealed?	s
It is an enjoyable film, but hardly does tell the real story of James J. Corbett.	s
They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right.	s
They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore.	s
And always will.	s
Although she is clearly characterized as a "bad" girl, Jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon.	s
Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy," which has been restored for this version.	s
You start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran.	s
It is OK through it all.	s
It wouldn't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money.	s
It's about what in fact Cassavetes has made a staple of his career, an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front.	s
I dont think "action" is the right genre, though there're lot of action and KongFu scenese.	s
It is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation, making him a Great Leader who is here engaged in single-handedly civilizing the American frontier through the grand instrument of Law.	s

WE SHOULD ALL HEED TO YOUR COMPETENT AND PRAISEWORTHY OPINION.	s

Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work.	s
While scenes in the present are color saturated, the 1943 scenes are washed out, strong on blue-gray tones.	s
One of the best scenes is Michael lifting Bob off the ground.	s
Brilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especialy the Gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota", and my other director's favourite "Davitelj protiv davitelja").	s
The way that Danse Macabre utilises the 'haunted house' theme is both well done and original, and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible.	s
The film as a whole is beautiful.	s
where do i began, it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars.	s
We feel Homer¡¦s desire to earn his father¡¦s recognition and create his own future, and his resilience wins our respect.	s
Adolescents might like to THINK they know what's holding Nolte in that one spot, but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring.	s
Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice!	s
It's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one.	s
Somewhat too long and going over the top towards the end, this comedy is an utterly delightful, never condescending or ridiculing look into the problems of a "power man", who likes to wear women´s clothes at nite.	s
My only gripes are as follows.	s
I'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences.	s
James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.	s
Not as much action as the usual war movie, but yet still recommended -- especially for Civil War buffs.	s
Gypo, with the new 20 Pounds of blood money earned, finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the IRA invests all their resources to find Frankie's informer.	s

Mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns.	s
Don't believe them.	s

Maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie, because of its 3 parts, showed as flashbacks.	s
Pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities.	s
There are none of these.	s
Scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film's release, and the scenes of crowding, and bodies, live and dead, lying all about are still chilling, as well as influential.	s
IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in a company together with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first ones contract a professional killer, ANISIO, to murder ESTEVÃO (the plot, at least at the beginning, doesn't explain very well why).	s
In many ways, good-natured and sweet, representing right and trying to restore disruptions to the natural order, he is also a near-lunatic who will stop at nothing to achieve murderous revenge, whose relentless quest mirrors Ethan Edwards in THE SEARCHERS in its inhuman persistance, whose human instincts are frayed by this quest, and whose bursts of violence are genuinely terrifying to witness.	s
After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.	s
It is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity.	s
If you are use to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy.	s
You will drift from thinking "how come the human being can be so vicious" to "why not after all?	s

Another returning member of the Killer Tomatoes stock company is Rick Rockwell (now best known as the hapless title subject of "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?").	s
I saw it twice about 25yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then.	s
The passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable.	s
Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, colour.	s
It is really worth watching.	s
The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in Kurosawa's samurai epics, or the Zaitochi series.	s
Some of Britain's best artists, from Mr Holloway to Wayne and Radford and the delicious Miss Rutherford, having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the Home Office.	s
A deliciously unhinged Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie.	s
That feature is definitely a lot of fun!!	s
I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by Veronica.	s
There are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not.	s
It may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes, but I can't see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release.	s

I don't care what anyone says about this movie.	s
Did I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle's score?	s
Clean and wonderful!	s
I'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance.	s
I don't remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it about six years ago, and it still remains one of my favorite comedies.	s
Though the production isn't quite Hollywood quality--no big special effects--still, the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it.	s
Slaone isn't far behind in the "strange" category.	s
Having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the (in this case) wrong tracks of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the prime suspect (by which time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the cop goes by himself in Merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder!	s
If you feel the same way about the older films I don't think you can go wrong with this one.	s
This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening.	s
As they scrupulously imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame, the distinction of black and white here is full-blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters' less starkly definite moral codes, and the outcome is a harsh and judgmental vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going, sporadically caused to undergo the most blaring and ruthless of illumination.	s
See how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on TV after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get??	s

The fight scenes are amazing.	s
The only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927.	s
What an extraordinary crime thriller!!	s
Older film-goers learned to bide their time patiently through the slow parts, calm in the knowledge that the big payoff is on the way.	s
This makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote.	s
Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated period piece; every piece of cloth and jewel (both of which have major parts in this movie's plot) look fresh and new, and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants.	s

Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food.	s
I don't agree.	s

They have some great exchanges of dialog in the film.	s
It just didn't strike the right chord.	s
However, this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too.	s
Like I said there is the one implausibility involving Powers Booth's character, but it really isn't a big thing.	s
Valentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him.	s

By the time I had gotten to this fourth and final story, it was after 3 am and I couldn't quite stay awake on the first try (not from boredom).	s
Farrah Fawcett gives an award nominated performance as an attempted rape victim who turns the tables on her attacker.	s
From the moment they meet, Axel has a strong influence on Egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything (such as reading thick books like Egon); ultimately, Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country.	s

Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a disease which affects all the muscles in his body.	s

Once they begin opening up though, it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the façade they have created for themselves.	s
This isn't exactly a great film, but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different.	s
The movie's charm lies in, to me, the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience.	s
I hope so!	s
An artist's profound vision, his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring Hosanna, blending his creations with trees, white water dashing against rocks, fields and rain...Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive, aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth.	s

This relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels.	s
Darius is from Georgia, so I expect the tickets for the Atlanta showing will be sold out quickly, if they are not already.	s
I loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film.	s
The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Phillipines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by President Truman.	s
There is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing C&C, and talking to each other about getting the diamonds.	s

My favorite part of the film remains the same: Ed failing to kill the deer...then changing.	s
That scene alone, pretty much represents everything I want to see in a film.	s
Nowadays I am waiting for the DVD version, at any price, please!	s
One of my all time favourite films, ever.	s
There is one fast clip in the section on Peahi in Hawaii, which I still cannot understand.	s
Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination.	s
It was later re-rated R on appeal.)	s
Be warned.	s
Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters Disney ever created.	s
Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent, dishonorable way.	s
Some of the dialogue & action is rather provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker singing & dancing to 'Under The African Sky,' as well as her culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub, are two of the cinema's more memorable moments.	s
A Hit Is a Hit: 3.5/5 11.	s
Although too young to remember the first showing of the series (being just a baby) I later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's, just when I was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects.	s
You got Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous 'twins', and she's in a Christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup.	s
Her Oscar was well deserved.	s
And it is done in a truly beautiful way.	s
There's also some gore to be seen, but not very much.	s
Or was another team in the frame?	s
It also tied in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don't exercise, with nice examples within the body.	s
The Frenchman becomes their slave, and maritally lives with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães).	s
My favorite one was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor.	s
Hey o.k., I realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences, but it is a sad commentary when this lovely, powerful...extraordinarily, Directed, Acted, and written film seems to be over looked.	s
Overall a great underrated piece of filmwork, if you liked American History X you'll love this one.	s
Unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent (explicitly stated in a scene where the Bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and, through butting up against a whole system of subjugation, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her.	s
It nicely portrays the life of Gandhiji's Eldest Son Harilal.	s
Raj and his family are playing cricket one day and Priya has an accident which causes Priya to have a miscarriage.	s
What was truly interesting was how political it was, maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration.	s
Others were delighted by it.	s
I have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show!	s
The director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither, emphasizing the development of Aicha as an individual who became a champion, not so much in the ring, but to all those around her.	s
Grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas.	s
This is much more than some home movies.	s
Hey now, I can't claim to have seen all of the films of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and there sure seem to be a lot of them, but this is one of the better (and weirder) of the lot that I have seen.	s
Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who's looking to turn pro.	s
This film really captures that fragile time in life when want, needs, pressures, womanhood, childhood, the world and loneliness are all embodied in each female's head, each factor on the precipice.	s
After all it's Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton cavorting in the world of the rich.	s
I have decided to buy the DVD box of the First Season and this first episode surprised me.	s
There are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt, and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring, but overall it is handled better than at first thought.	s
He makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones.	s
It's kind of a feel-good movie.	s
She whined and whined and whined.	s
i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting.	s
Travel in the world of abstraction and on into the future with breathtaking computer animation imagery.	s
But I digress...	s
The script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good, though some of the experimentation just doesn't work.	s
I had honest laughs.	s
Both the girl and the watch were sinking, and he had to choose which one, and he chose the girl.	s
It's a good example of feel good cinema.	s
Murray Hamilton is especially good in a supporting role as Stewart's partner and best friend.	s
The acting was A-grade and it's a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscurity.	s
Besides John Cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in Grosse Point blank which I liked.	s
Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show.	s
It is especially poignant to return to this 1989 film now as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the raw treatment they are receiving in our Veterans' Hospitals.	s
They both are in the school's volley ball team.	s
But later it's shown in all its crazy glory.	s
A character appears on the bus in mid-trip without explanation or introduction, and occassionally sits next to the others, and they look at her like she doesn't belong.	s
I'm telling you, there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny.	s
This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud.	s
Jack Palance's character, Blackie, serves effectively as Satan in human form: the angular-jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic, but is always liable to explode into fits of violence; his two hoodlums (played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel), through terror more than anything else, are constantly grovelling at his feet.	s
The beautiful & very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who's performance in Bastard Out of Carolina & Single White Female I will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the film and does a superb job.	s
It might have been interesting if Valentino had done this one with Garbo, but he might have been beyond film making when this was done.	s
This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end.	s
So Anna tries to rub him out and start again, but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out).	s
Impressively, in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" he doesn't disappoint.	s
It even elaborated on Freddy's backstory.	s
Smooth boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits circus boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep the pretty but fickle Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby.	s
Really, you don't.	s
I have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story.	s
The children LOVED it and so did we (hubbie and I are 36 and 32, respectively)!	s
He was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it.	s
We we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us- no one we know, but we've doubtless heard of them in a book or on TV or somewhere.	s
Utterly tactical, strange (watch for the kinky moment of a drop-dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull-string doll for some rich folks), pointless but undoubtedly compelling late-night feature.	s
Alright, so, Some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight, turning them into flesh-eating zombies, who go on a rampage, inflicting some of the most gruesome, yet humorous gore-scenes of the 90's.	s
Its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs.	s
in this film is impressive, he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko, which is a plus in my book.	s
Scorcese doesn't necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either (Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, two of Scorcese's biggest influences, are only mentioned in passing).	s
I liked it, I hope you do.	s
There is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning.	s
The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports...	s
Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett.	s
it was and remains far ahead of its time.	s
The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given.	s
Nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest.	s
If you don't, it's decent.	s
In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking.	s
There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys who's wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon, and they want to first figure out who he is (by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy), then kill him.	s
The cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and Technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly.	s
He hasn't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big Hollywood films.	s
if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they?	s
do you still love woody allen's humor and sense of the absurd?	s
All in all, Scoop is by far Woody Allen's most satisfying comedy in a decade.	s
This intensely involving 2007 character-driven suspense drama is like a big, juicy piece of Shakespearean-level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious, to-the-edge performances from his actors.	s
Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable.	s
Credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting.	s
The title 'Soul of a Man' is after a Willie Dixon song.	s
Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured.	s
I was treated to a viewing of Cracker Bag last night before a preview screening of Disney's Holes.	s
The angles Fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for its time).	s
Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt.	s
This season added so many new things, most of them terrible (like losing team having to sleep outside in tents, winning PM continues to be PM ,for example).	s
We see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially-made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build Christy a room of his own in their back yard.	s
As noted above, the cast is first rate down to the smallest role.	s
Mustan?	s
if the Golden Age detective story is mere puzzle, Curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme, creating an abstract variation on his source, reducing narrative, character and location to geometry, a series of lines, from the beautiful art-deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition , and, as they glide furiously at an angle, jolt the dead decor to life.	s
For some time, William H. Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business, creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in `Magnolia,' The Shoveler in `Mystery Men' and Jerry Lundegaard in `Fargo.'	s
As if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie, even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene.	s
Syrianna: of side note - Mark Cuban Exec.	s
Demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will.	s
She offers herself to Richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed.	s
But as Bruce gets involved with three young women, he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl.	s
He seemed more like an empty canvas than a person.	s
This anime is a must-see for fans of Evangelion.	s
I guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process.	s
He was a smuggler, a slave trader, an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to.	s
Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking!	s
It's a flawed film, but a must see for any Hartley or 'Henry Fool' fan.	s
Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes).	s
Seeing this movie about British royals spoken in German adds to its quaint charm.	s
She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead.	s
Its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements.	s
Who cares what was taken out?!	s
I won't say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen, and tell you to go out and see it!	s
That was all done in the TV show.	s
Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot.	s
This is for many reasons.	s
The gore is well done and used sparingly (look out for the excellent barbed-wire death) & the action is punchy when used.	s
Paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the Production Code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's Search for Beauty).	s
This uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that I would enjoy seeing again.	s
There's never a dull moment in this movie.	s
An interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique, fingerprinting, which is crucial in bringing about Price's downfall (in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax)though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run!	s
When you view it, you get the feeling that you've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching the whole time.	s
Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe, but at the same time pay back his boss.	s
However, as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well "The Big Bad Swim" compared to the others featured during the festival.	s
I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a bit of guts.	s
This movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-shifting limits of mores, race relations and desire.	s
Escapism is really seldom these days, and "Basic Instinct 2" gives us real fans what we've been expecting.	s
What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.	s
Who knew he would have stolen in excess of 100k(in 1987 when that was real money) after being in town for only 1 month.	s
There is some development in the relationship and personalities of Dave and Andrew, some background is given, but ultimately not enough.	s
Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along.	s
On a small budget- at least for the likes of Darryl F. Zanuck- Fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere.	s
We see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow.	s
David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and there is a bitter-sweet ending from Malik's point of view.	s
The naturalism is whole, complete.	s
I don't recall where I saw it.	s
The love-triangle plot is focused on Jerry's involvement with Milo Roberts, a self-proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists.	s
In addition to Bake's mistake, Connie spent all of her money to repair a ship that she was hoping Bilge would take over as captain.	s
But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market.	s
Audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters.	s
The acting on all parts is superb-- and yes, some of the acts are caricature characters.	s
The good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck.	s
Now can Mrs Drablow's belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help Kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about.	s
Check out this movie.	s
Usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate/resentment, the villain transforms the vibrant colorful Yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals(those whove played the video game, Sonic The Hedghog, might remember a certain Dr. Robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who Sonic had to then "liberate").	s
The guys who play the Beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals, but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate.	s
This wordiness touches the very roots of the genre.	s
However, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk--the typical bad guy from Westerns.	s
If you get the chance, you should definitely see this film.	s
This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories.	s
This is a very exciting and romantic film.	s
That building populated by great old Academy Award winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova.	s
Compared with other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement.	s
BSG's story, of a mournful ragged band of survivors, trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors.	s
The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed surrounded by evil, secret forces trying to drive him mad.	s
My favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems, some pain, do their dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on.	s
The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey throughout the tribulation (and two of the film's three sequels) tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation.	s
I'll admit,at first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox,and a little because of Simon Pegg... First of all,if you have watched a decent amount of movies,you will know that Sidney and Alison would be together at the and of the movie,one way or another...but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won't know how... Okay,now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg.I can't see any other actor in the role of Sidney,and I'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for Pegg's great performance.	s
A man named Yukon replaces Flippen.	s
This is why i so love this website !	s
Ordinarily I really enjoy movies like "Chances Are," but I wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons.	s
This is a good cast and the story moves along, but Pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better earlier roles.	s
It's not too much of a stretch to imagine "Forbidden Planet" as a direct antecedent of the 'Star Trek' TV series; Gene Roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show.	s
Just remember: In this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / TV room.	s
Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material.	s
Here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special.	s
Some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see.	s
Yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything!	s
Nothing more.	s
Some of the actors (other than those playing Kolchak’s co-workers) return in the same roles – Keenan Wynn and Ramon Bieri (both as officers of the law), John Fiedler (as a shrewd morgue attendant) and Richard Kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero.	s
The fact that it's supposed to be good, nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here, so I'll issue a caveat: if you're the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical ("Am I to believe this is some sort of.. *snort*... _magic_ xylophone?	s
And it must be said that stereotyping has hampered, or completely ruined, a significant number of acting careers.	s
But who cares?	s
I also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded.	s
Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film.	s
It happened in a larger town; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state.	s
Singin’ In The Rain, An American In Paris, The Band Wagon, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Oklahoma, South Pacific, The King And I, and many more, stand tall as much cherished products of the age.	s
And Victor Borge gets in a bit of his routine in, which is a bonus.	s
Schygulla wasn't nominated for an Academy Award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time.	s
This movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons: (1) I never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film.	s
Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to Miami.	s
You might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with "straight Japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop".	s
This shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum.	s
There is no glitter or "bling" in this movie, just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil.	s
I hadn't heard of him before, but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end.	s
TRICK OR TREAT is a fine example of Hollywood jumping on the "backwards messages in metal music" bandwagon that Tipper Gore and her Washington Wives kick-started in the mid-'80s (other, less successful entries in this mini-genre include the awful BLACK ROSES and silly THE GATE).	s
Jokes and one liners are really good.	s
i totally disagree.i thought that this was a great movie for kids.dawn wells from gilligans island,and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato.it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff.no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be.i wont ruin the ending.but it was unusual the way that it was done.i mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the end.the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially.it also helps them out of a jam towards the end.it also has the plus of not being overly long.i think it clocks in at under 95 minutes	s
It's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons MOST of the audience.	s
This is accomplished using a poster of Iranian soccer star Ali Daei as a mask, with eye holes punched out.	s
Dixon's homophobia is obvious.	s
Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film 'The Interpretor'.	s
But what really distinguishes this film, about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman(Excalibur) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes.	s
I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime.	s
I certainly recommend it.	s
But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to move beyond their station in life.	s
EPIC!	s
A little variety from Bob Hoskins is necessary to fire kindled.	s
In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art.	s
Don't get me wrong, I love the book.	s
Overall I've scored the actual short as a 6 out of 10, but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort, because I'd have scored it an 8 or 9 in these fields.	s
Jean Peters was great as the streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever.	s
What we essentially get here is the rural Mid-Western answer to "Ordinary People."	s
Finally this Russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor.	s
death.	s
Recognized as a cult classic, this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung- fu action movies.	s
It's worth seeing more than once.	s
Although the video clips and the in-depth research is well-respected, it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers.	s
Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality.	s
Even though this was a disaster in the box office, It is my favorite film.	s
you-know-what, can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations.	s
The cuasi-surrealist scenes fit in perfectly: Georges recalls (or invents) past scenes of his life while either day-dreaming or sleeping; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct.	s
Worth watching for the outstanding performances.	s
Loved it.	s
Emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting.	s
Great voices, lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie.	s
Here comes the question: which portrayal seems more captivating, which one is better for sure?	s
However, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car.	s
A very racy film for the early '70s.	s
Later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name.	s
I just hope some network brings this series back one day so that I'll be able to see every episode.	s
And those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what?	s
The love scene involving grocery items has to be seen, it cannot be described.	s
Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell.	s
Many years after the film he married a Latter-saint woman and was eventually converted to the LDS faith.	s
What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna's choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene, from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice.	s
While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage.	s
And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern might have even toped him self with this one.	s
She is not bad, she is different, sometimes overacts (from today's perspective) but is no longer that genuine in the role as Marie Dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time.	s
Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees Marion Davies but it is something to the effect of "I don't think I like her!"	s
Add Max von Sydow's hypnotic narration, and Europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world.	s
The "peripheral characters" are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair.	s
This movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence!!	s
A man readjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage.	s
I couldn't exactly say that about him in "There's Something About Mary."	s
The idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see, may even have influenced Álex de la Iglesia in his film La habitación del niño (2006) of the following year, with which it bears striking similarity.	s
It wouldn't surprise me.	s
I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to seeing how the series develops.	s
It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are.	s
The show is really funny.	s
The adaptation is loose at best, but really, if you're watching a musical, you ain't there for the story.	s
The other being Gene Wilder's "The World's Greatest Lover" which Fox has sat on since the early 80's as well...	s
The movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit.	s
The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about.	s
But he is "worth every penny" of any DVD rented or purchased.	s
In year 2002 they made a sequel which had a PG-13 rating, but without Jet Li and Liu Qing Yun.	s
With all its quirks and inconsistent writing I still thought "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" was funny and enjoyed the movie.	s
Where does fiction end?	s
It would be wrong, however, to give the impression that I disliked the film altogether.	s
That little robot "Jinx"(friends for ever!).	s
WHEN I first saw this film, in London, in 1958, I was bowled over.	s
Enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be, when in the hands of geniuses.	s
I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.	s
I saw this film by chance on the small box.	s
The plot and the acting was top notch.	s
One guy, however, is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7:35 in the morning.	s
And that means, I don't have to suffer through the other 98% of these mind numbing talk shows or "reality" shows, for one nugget of "funny" or "shock."	s
Virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her...	s
Caprica feels different.	s
She doesn't hide her contempt for this kind soul that has fallen in love with the wrong woman.	s
The land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge.	s
About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things.	s
The movie director took a risk (and it is a risky risk) in telling the lives of many (and I mean MANY) different people and having the intertwine at various intervals.	s
You can tell they just didn't care about plot, they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible.	s
And Pushing Daisies lives up to those expectations.	s
The youth Cédric (Stéphane Rideau) follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction.	s
Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson.	s
The direction is superb.	s
Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence (and he does in this film, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way.	s
Bonnie Jordan (Joan Crawford) is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear!!!	s
But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ship's first class staircase.	s
But let's mention those sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight T-shirts, sweating profusely.	s
As Philip, Leslie Howard is excellent.	s
If you are not moved by that scene, you don't have a heart.	s
I honestly felt that the animation style Ruby Spears did was reminiscent of the Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians series by Hanna Barbera a few years before.	s
I first saw it on Comedy Central several years ago.	s
As it is expected, the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence, it is hard to fill an hour and a half.	s
John Hurt plays the arrogant and foppish Montrose, who is eventually implied to be Cunningham's father.	s
Ada and Rick's secret marriage is omitted.	s
But to some people it's probably not their cup of tea.	s
Nolte is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger Campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past.	s
And coming from Theodore Sturgeon, another of the great SF short story writers they used in the first season, one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that Sturgeon turned in.	s
YES amazing grace !	s
The pacing is also better and overall it just works better.	s
It all seems to center around student Ann Portland(Uschi Glas), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth.	s
The physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story.	s
He sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people.	s
The movie is smart, funny, and well written, with dialogue that is simple but effective.	s
Overall if you are a fan of noir movies, then this one is for you.	s
Regardless of the story it was the lead character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere.	s
The locations are great and the situation is one of those old time Preston sturgess movies.	s
This film is truly funny, if you don't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on.	s
The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, crafts wonderfully honest characters, and has them do completely believable things.	s
I also found the story to be very absorbing.	s
I'll come clean.	s
Notice how each time they meet, Dixon manhandles Scalise: he picks the address-book out of his jacket, slaps his face, punches him.	s
I couldn't have done better myself!	s
Childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver Michael McCord (a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by Martin Sheen) shows up in town in his souped-up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (Sheen's real-life sibling Joe Estevez in a brief cameo).	s
Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) develops through the movie as a person.	s
Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions.	s
Why they didn't have more songs from the Runaways I'll never know ?	s
I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise.	s
It's not better than the amazing ones (_Strictly Ballroom_, _Shall we dance?_ (Japanese version), but it's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts.	s
Excellent direction, good killings and gore, and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run.	s
not only are the effects extraordinary, vs. crap like 'earth vs. the flying saucers'---the real 'killer' is the 'universality of plot'---everything hinges on two principles---the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous-thinking father's desire for his daughter, and the idea of what would happen should a world's tech reach the point where all citizen's desires become manifest.	s
As Sissy asserts her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-con and prison rodeo star--a real bull rider--, Wes (played wonderfully greasy by Scott Glenn).	s
The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups, are still working to these evil group's advantage.	s
you may easily guess the outcome, but who cares?	s
Once returning home George takes his son sledding and while there sledding he's knocked off the board and Miles is chases by the wind, after gaining conciseness they go looking for George, they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot, in the Hospital Kim tells the Sheriff that Otis may have shot him, the Shrieff goes to Otis's place where he's bashed over the head with a hammer, as Otis drives down the road he finds that the Wendigo is after him.	s
This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.	s
On the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish.	s
I do not think this is one of her best acting jobs.	s
No motherly love for this movie, quite the opposite.	s
This movie is SOOOO funny!!!	s
I liked the way Mel Brooks pays homage to Charles Chaplin in this film.	s
Bravo!	s
I saw WHIPPED at a press screening and it was hilarious.	s
A space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp.	s
I personally liked the movie because of its off-beat humor.	s
Heirs of Stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the Kingdom.	s
I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear.	s
Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a great ending!	s
The story is sweeping.	s
All he sees is her head, arms, and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up, she has been completely sliced in two.	s
This is not usually the case (off hand I think of Ashley Wilkes as a man who might be betrayed, if he and Scarlett O'Hara were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell - but Ashley loved Melonie, not Scarlett).	s
She confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter.	s
The idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist.	s
And in doing so, it resonates with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus" which begins: "Out of the night that covers me,//Black as the Pit from pole to pole,//I thank whatever gods may be//For my unconquerable soul."	s
I would guess that there are 1214 scenes, which are not united by a plot.	s
The only character I found hollow was Sally's eccentric, ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era.	s
I tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted.	s
Dick Powell was the host of the Hollywood Hotel program on CBS radio network in which Louella Parsons dished out the weekly scoop on the stars.	s
Highlights of the film include the opening moments, where Little Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the "tea for two" sequence, the birthday party, the climactic argument, the grocery deliver scene, and the scene in the attic.	s
This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles.	s
As Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from throughout the movie, whose lives had been touched by Joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful.	s
It's definitely one of the better directed Columbo movies.	s
I considered about the vote of this movie, I thought this is should be a very popular movie.	s
If you were alive in the 1970s like me, you might even feel like you were in that apartment.	s
I noticed that in one scene, Elmer is reading a comic book featuring Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig.	s
Both are classics and a bit better than this film.	s
The slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature, and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed.	s
The cast of "Soapdish" is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection.	s
Most of the principals interviewed in this series - some at the center of power like Traudl Junge (Hitler's Secretary),Karl Doenitz (head of Germany's navy) Anthony Eden (UK) - are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on.From Generals and Admirals to Sergeants, Russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, all are on record here.	s
If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle, with Sylvia Kristel, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic.	s
I have seen several comments here about Brando using a Southern accent, some of which felt it was a mistake.	s
It's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance.	s
Che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind.	s
It is not for want of moral courage but since a) not all good plans can succeed and b) being human, mistakes are inevitable.	s
love yours truly: Dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it@hot mail.com if you wanna	s
What surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted.	s
It so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was Michael Meyers, whom I eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep.	s
She takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself.	s
Alisan porter is a really good actor and i Love that movie Its so funny when she is dealing the cards.	s
They help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true for many of my pre-med friends).	s
Despair" by John Gilmore: "The January 1947 slaying of the young, beautiful would-be actress Elizabeth Short, known as "The Black Dahlia", was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime.	s
When he's being diplomatic in most films, he says please and thank you as he pummels people!!!!	s
If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts, I'd feel a lot better about it.	s
The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding.	s
Well, okay, not really.	s
This isn't the prototypical action movie, thank God.	s
I find it to have a rather shrill quality.	s
The plot and layout is not overly original.	s
Over time, they form an unlikely friendship.	s
In some of the scenes, I thought out loud...why has he never been approached to play singer/songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic.	s
T.L.	s
He went for the pin, but Heyman pulled the ref from the ring!	s
There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out.	s
The difference; he can retaliate in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog.	s
It is their job to Kill the good Biff and Fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no-one could like.	s
I haven't always been a fan, but the show grew on me.	s
Actually, by the end of the night, she seems to be pretty into it, and when morning comes, the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave.	s
All in all, the series has enormous potential.	s
Overall this is a very funny sitcom.	s
Along the way, Mad Dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow-witted young woman, and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation.	s
Story leads us to South Africa and this (movie) is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and I'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie.	s
I think this was absolutely realistic!	s
And Grant, Fairbanks, and MacLaughlin have got it in spades.	s
Any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the IMDb, given all the cross-referencing that goes on here.	s
Ironically enough it was Eric Fleming who left the show before it closed to do films.	s
I don't think Spike Jones and His City Slickers ever played it that much.	s
Its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only has the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season.	s
In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.	s
This move is loved by many types of people, men and women, young and old alike.	s
Where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the Mahatma and Kasturba?	s
Very entertaining and definitely recommended.	s
In fact, the character of Poe appears in the beginning and end of the film--though it didn't look especially like him.	s
Watching Hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn, or Laurel's antics with bananas, for instance, reminds the viewer why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants.	s
This has to be Brosnan's best performance to date, he convinces admirably as the English boy playing Indians.	s
Now THAT is "hollow"!	s
These actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time, presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry.	s
The acting was great (P'z to Dom) and the cinematography was also very well done.	s
I first saw this film 10 years ago or so, and I still crack up every time I watch it.	s
Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan's Labyrinth.	s
The ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!.	s
And of course, visually it won't disappoint, but that's almost a given with Pixar flicks.	s
Alas, even knowing the name, I shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially.	s
How does he get out?	s
If you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think I highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie.	s
Though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of Spock being court-martialed is a clever one.	s
His character, "George Grisby," is one of the strangest people I've ever seen on film.	s
And two - the fact that the show has been put "on hiatus" and we will not see the show finish in it's entirety.	s
Great Classic film, with great Classic Actors !	s
So I really wish they could start making new episodes.	s
BUT, you can't expect a plot or non-cliches in this kind of movie!	s
Acting ISN'T his profession, this was a film made for entertainment, so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn't Robert DeNiro and thinking they're making a point is sadly deluded.	s
So are age related artifacts.	s
That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims.	s
Is it a plane?	s
This movie is all right.	s
The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast.	s
This society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls.	s
As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys).	s
A few nitpicks: Most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red).	s
I have seen it several times in my short 19 years.	s
Jeniffer Aniston was great, she will finally have a hit movie under her belt.	s
I hope for all the actors sakes that CBS gives them a chance.	s
And the wife-corpse.	s
He-he-hello!!	s
Such questions intensely arise while watching the movie, when, to the core, the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters.	s
The camera motion, color, lighting, compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film.	s
The music by Patrick Doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie.	s
Mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!	s
good for playing in short bursts of time.	s
INTERESTED IN HAVING A COPY: WRITE TO ME HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM	s
His name is Sandy Collora.	s
When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was not the least bit surprised.	s
The funny thing is, even the other people who saw this movie and "hated it" admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it.	s
This may all sound like a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, with Cagney bouncing, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it's done.	s
There's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast.	s
Remember H.G.	s
In fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film : in the Swiss-French border where the pretagonist leads secluded life; in the his recurring daydream and nightmare; inside his ailing body after heart transplantation....	s
Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the Werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists.	s
Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding, but it is the stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen, blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game.	s
Thus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are.	s
If you like dancing, you'll love this version.	s
After his wife and child are killed, Arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths.	s
Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish ducks & nails her own Chick Kick for the win to retain her title.	s
although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new, this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas.	s
Grade: ***** out of *****	s
See if you can pick out future star Leatrice Joy in the ensemble.	s
I especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view.	s
The whole concept and by extension the movie itself, was probably originated from this simple pitch: what if G.I.	s
Lebrun and Léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed.	s
Bettie Page was a icon of the repressed 1950s, when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults.	s
Darshan jariwala is also good as MK Gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character.	s
Pike, Jim Kirk, etc..	s
A good little find, this one, I'd give it 8 out of 10.	s
This movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way.	s
He sends his soldiers to burn the Highlanders' homes, to kill their people and their livestock... Tim Roththe perfect antithesis to the hero, is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer...	s
Bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film!	s
Zombie with no legs swimming in a pool.	s
I don't hate it when I guess the ending early in a film.	s
It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3.	s
The program notes said it was - A perfect delight -deftly made, touching, amusing, dramatic and poignantly meaningful.	s

A few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot.	s
Lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he swerved to miss Clark in the pilot of the series.	s
I hate the term "hillbillies", because - as some "users" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life.	s
The acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers I would think you'd keep more to yourself.	s
I have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered.	s
The first was 'Paris,J'Taime', which I really enjoyed.	s
cause they will always be there for us!	s

Perhaps current events in the Middle-East led people to take the attitude, "I came for a comedy and by George I'm going to enjoy it."	s
But here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery.	s
Gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree, has a warm heart but a short fuse, and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self-centered pig.	s
Tyler Hoechlin, an up and coming star who shows great promise in Hollywood co stars as Hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance.	s
However the film for me is captivating because of her performance, besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities.	s
To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it.	s
The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation.	s
It also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole.	s
I've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says so many things: it's a commentary about materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about rich and poor people, about the media and what it celebrates, about fame and adulation.	s
Had this movie been made just a few years later, I would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor.	s
OK, this movie starts out like a cheesy Lifetime movie and doesn't get better till almost well through the movie.	s
the acting and plot are amazing.	s
But the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like Murnau's "Nosferatu".	s
The theater in Manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of May's age.	s
I couldn't quite remember the title (remember I didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless), and to make matters worse, the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles (aka Danze Macabre, Coffin of Terror, Castle of Terror, Long Night of Terror, etc...) and the USA/UK working title "Castle of Blood" was very generic, similar to dozens of other "b" horror and suspense films, making it illusive.	s
I enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite.	s
As usual, Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered.	s
When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city, apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death,it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later, "The Woman in Green" in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone)is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized.	s
Kochak, an illegal immigrant, had been in a gang with Blackie (Jack Palance), Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Vince Poldi (Tommy Cook) and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation, he presumes that Kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country.	s
The scintillating Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (current day Sri Lanka).	s
So Anna decides to draw her father in.	s
The main reason this show succeeds it because of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie.	s
One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie, he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman's character) was a good influence on him.	s
They are both terrific 1950s horror films.	s
If you like escape from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you.	s
There is an episode of The Simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a "Killbot Factory".	s
Instead, she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot.	s
Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John's life into a nightmare for all of us watching.	s
Very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!	s
I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true Asian movie, to see this movie.	s
Feroze Khan and Anil Kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above-average performances from the ensemble of actors.	s
It is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Predator.	s
I did not see this film in the theater.	s
Not everything is what it seems.	s
God have mercy on you.	s
Another reason I thought I wouldn't care for the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox.	s

A Chinese Ghost Story stars the late, great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple, where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called Tsing (Joey Wang).	s

The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes.	s
The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else I've seen in animation.	s
In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named Zomcon.	s
Massey himself helps things a lot, playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto, contrasting well with a largely diffident cast, save for Richardson, and Scott and Chapman, slightly.	s
In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think that that is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken.	s

This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube that is.	s
Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world.	s
This film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply.	s
While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio.	s
But Julie Stiles's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity.	s
Let me move to the movie review now.	s
Her delivery is precise and oh so funny.	s
I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces).	s
which are required to make a movie hit.	s

So to round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent.	s
Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences.	s
When I first saw this film, I thought it was NOT a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true.	s
Even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a big ol' bear and a fox.	s
The cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'Grim' throughout - in terms of setting.	s
Some of us are not sheep.	s

I watched because I had just seen a documentary on "bad women", actresses in the U.S. pre- movie censorship board set up in the early '30s.	s
This is one of the few Kung-Fu movies with a decent plot.	s
I question anyone saying they don't care for this movie.	s
Safely set within a historical context, FLAVIA charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century Italian nun (Florinda Bolkan's career performance, even surpassing her sterling work in Lucio Fulci's devastating DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING), locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's budding sensuous nature.	s
I can't say more without spoiling things.	s
The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy.	s
The story is well written.	s
The performances are easy, relaxed, and natural; just what you would expect from "A List" actors.	s
I was also surprised to find that the voice of Paulie was performed by Jay Mohr.	s
It's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6-week(that's my best guess for its duration) journey.	s
The kids are so heartbreakingly goofy (and pimply) that you can't help but feel for them.	s
My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book.	s
Ditto Boman.	s
The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the Krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago!	s
In conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and it truly deserves more attention.	s
However one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee.	s
The director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details.	s
The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor!	s
To watch the actors, you would think that they are the actual characters.	s
Almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed.	s
A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on "The Real McCoys" TV series.	s
On the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it.	s
Lastly, It has a really cute story.	s
Little Britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas.	s
Why Kikuno would continue carrying on the way she did when Fusanosuke announced his impending marriage really didn't seem true  people hadn't really changed that much, and the character Kikuno was so strong and resilient that even if they were busy taking on O-shin's business for naught, the reaction seemed out of character and unnecessary and distracting.	s
I enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on Full House.	s
Some say that Ann was, in fact, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support it.	s
He completely shuns others except for his family, he is meticulous and precise about everything he does and for a while appears the prime mover in the plot to attack the school.	s
Marshall the Governor, and Claire Bloom is charismatic as Bonnie Brown.	s
All the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today.	s
She has the desire to graduate, and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor, the girl in the hospital.	s
One would have to be completely "out of touch" with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen.	s
Although not a movie critic, but as an avid reader of classic literature, I am glad to recommend this fine production without any reservations whatsoever.	s
I do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film, particularly that whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles.	s
Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind?	s
It's amazing that actress P.J.	s
True stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang, and that's the case here, but apart from that, this is a highly recommended detective yarn.	s
There are scenes of reconciliation between various characters, and the final scene of the movie was brilliant.	s
After "What Is It?"	s
It was a great experience and i loved every minute of it.	s
Sometimes I just want to laugh.	s
But other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary, and Foulkrod's use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war.	s
That's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing!	s
In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this.	s
There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix.	s
So what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza.	s
I have to agree with most of the other posts.	s
Only once in a while do we get an R-rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention.	s
Above all, this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system.	s
As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey.	s
Mary, come hell or high water, will retrieve Tanya in the goal of "refreshing" her dying son.	s
On a secret army base at the Phillipines, scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus "Death One" and prepare it for transport.	s
The story is basic, and the plot is very good.	s
At the beginning of the film, we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small Irish village in which Sheila and Sean Cloney are happily married with two young children.	s
I was there a month ago and it is all there : the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart-beating city, the mess, the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted, blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever.	s
I like the story, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything.	s
I've dated guys like that.	s
I am a die-hard Yankees fan, and I didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes, when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games.	s
there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic.	s
I was too young to appreciate all of Al's subtle humor and satire at the time but I remember it much later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching.	s
Its a another Yash raj film which you know will look good on screen, all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice... Another rule of Yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent.	s
the uncle house is on Westway Dr, deer park, TX.	s
In 1990, Col.Fetisov was expeditiously promoted to General.	s
What about "Final Fantasy"?	s
Gorshin and Newmar do well (although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what's Waggoner taking to look that good?)	s
All this because of his failure in a polygraph test, due to his adulterous banging of the First Lady (Kim Basinger).	s
This film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made.	s
Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.	s
Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relations were, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment Lennon's murder received.	s
Their son, Timmy, befriends the zombie, naming him "Fido".	s
I recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece.	s
She is "screwing your brain" as Catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain.	s
Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the Judas drama.	s
What a beautiful day it is!"	s
the woman wonders.	s
Money, cars, houses, etc....don't make you happy, having the one person that you really want to be with to share it with does.	s
Obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other, June even offers to take his place!	s
Can you help me obtain this movie?	s
Also, Hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle.	s
It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it "builds" from there.	s
So 7 stars because in spite of the irritations it's still a good watch.	s
However, somewhere in college I watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal Best Films Ever collection.	s
Once things get sillier, however, you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades.	s
and then have you laughing.	s
That isn't made fully clear here.	s
One word: suPURRRRb!	s
As Rukh's wife, Frances Drake is extremely effective, truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress.	s
Who has never wanted to run away from the drudgeries of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had?	s
I would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.	s
I'd actually recommend this more to fans of the directors and/or the 80s than anyone else.	s
Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.	s
Corny?	s
He's the author of a fabulously successful Broadway play, but his last 4 efforts have flopped - horribly.	s
I wish that someday Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of Tsui but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of Zhang...	s
I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy.	s
And even though this movie was made over 70 years ago, it's still watchable, even today.	s
They all run away in a panic, yet she runs to the bathroom, and finds a bathtub.	s
Good acting and good scenery.	s
All in all, this is a powerful and heartwarming film that I hope everyone gets a chance to experience.	s
Serious kudos to her, can't wait to see more.	s
The show is less than an hour long.	s
Actress Cassandra Peterson has to this date ridden on that success.	s
The set is haunted(?)	s
The Jack Nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket.	s
What a surprise!	s
A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film.	s
Well... easily my favourite TV series ever.	s
They are the underlying strength of the film.	s
By the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him.	s
If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading.	s
Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate, Swinburne.	s
Like I said pure underground.	s
Yes, these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships.	s
Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director.	s
They meet by chance as Mark's plane (how does he know how to drive, maybe a little background info there?)	s
Michael Curtiz at his best.	s
Lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you shine always Melissa!!	s
Sufice it to say, it all really works!	s
It is the sweetest moment of the entire film.	s
Firstly, the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jackson's LOTR.	s
Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern-day film noir a winner.	s
As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can't imagine her saying she did think him handsome.	s
Get this and see it with someone special.	s
Not to mention easily Pierce Brosnon's best performance.	s
I'm curious how the story ends... and as I expect- everybody here do.	s
The form is weird beyond comment There are two voices-over,one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero",one for the aforementioned hero.The story takes place,now in Paris,now in Rouen ,Guy de Maupassant's town.In a scene with his shrink ,the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for Man and he draws a parallel between his despair and Maupassant's one.	s
The princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in "Pirates of the Caribbean" - never has death been so funny.	s
He will be humiliated by Mildred again, and again, as she makes no bones about what she really is.	s
I love the R.D.	s
But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf.	s
Steve Carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 Year Old Virgin, having only had supporting roles in such films as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on the Daily Show, we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that Carell truly makes his own.	s
Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion.	s
The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose!	s
Looking forward to January 2010	s
Dolph looks enthusiastic here, he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man (running from explosions in slow-mo, one liners, and handling large weapons) again in a movie like his older ones, albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like Army Of One.	s
The last, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.	s
It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans.	s
It's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing.	s
So I guess it's good it's still the original, but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English.	s
What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding?	s
The lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from Hoffman, Hawke and Finney; but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a Lifetime Achievement Oscar, much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business, Sidney Lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful, resonant, intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years.	s
Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.	s
Usually if a movie doesn't interest me, I start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake.	s
This terrifying film (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s.	s
Alta's other lover, icy lesbian casting agent Camila Stone (Mary Woronov), provides an alibi for Max.	s
I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the "reality" of the story but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy.	s
However, despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting, the film is still very watchable.	s
Stacy Peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job.	s
In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence.	s
King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film.	s
And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do," is quite exhilarating.	s
I strongly recommend this over the worn out, gaptoothed, overpriced VHS offerings available on eBay.	s
It is about how parents' behavior stays with their offspring.	s
This is an astounding film.	s
but max is a fun character, and acted well.	s
Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads.	s
As well as that of the Mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, Judge Stern.	s
Director Anthony Mann, who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one.	s
Ben Affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is James Gandofini.	s
You have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night.	s
For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa).	s
Granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed, knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct, knowing if they become extinct, the Native American way of life will greatly suffer.	s
Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "Scoop", seems to be the perfect foil for Woody Allen.	s
I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.	s
I am not sure why he has this obsession to show Child moles***ion and g*y concepts to the Indian filmy audience, but I find some of those scenes really disgusting!	s
So watch this movie & like myself & many others who have watched it, you'll be hooked.	s
I was always a big fan of this movie, first of all have you seen the cast, the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well.	s
If you have seen Raw (1987) you will have to see Delirious.	s
Jeremy Irons, as the brutal self-made rich man, is also excellent.	s
Many say that the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time.	s
The acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view.	s
I only hope he makes some shorts, more along the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials.	s
The main human characters are nice, well developed and well portrayed by respective actors.	s
Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point.	s
Go get this one, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.	s
I think I would wait for video- but it was a good laugh.	s
Iam not good at math	s
Costello haply approaches ex-roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past.	s
Of course we know his innocent, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but I was still entertained by THE SENTINEL.	s
Thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy.	s
But regarding the story, there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused.	s
Filmed in vibrant Technicolor, 'Elena and her Men' looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes.	s
I just cant say enough good things about it!	s
Even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises.	s
It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman.	s
The Shining starts with Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) driving to an isolated hotel named the 'Overlook' situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) about becoming the Winter caretaker.	s
In French with English subtitles.	s
After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema.	s
In the end, he steals her away and brings her to a safe-land in the comfort of the social worker.	s
I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night-club.	s
Opposites attract, and their personalities seem to complement one another, though there is some tension between the ambitious, studious, intellectual Alexandra and Kiki, who seems to be attending college to please her parents.	s
My personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter's vampires but i don't care I LOVED IT.	s
Nobody will know about Nolte's real role as an American agent except Goodman, Donovan, and Roosevelt himself.	s
Set in the Bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 Paris, it is in most respect a classic film noir script: lady in peril, sister trying to find her, honest cop fighting everyone.	s
Howard also performs well, but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis; so, their performances are wasted.	s
While the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory; cute creatures, junior heroes, a thoroughly evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and a telling lack of violence.	s
This film is a jolt of punk rock fun, from start to finish.	s
I was but fourteen years old.	s
I also just loved the ending theme.	s
Their attackers actually function as their liberators (of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey).	s
It is a film about middle age and the choices people make.It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness.	s
Much to her adult children's chagrin & nearly immediately after Elizabeth's (Dame Judy Dench) husband's death, the widowed, attic tenor saxophone player becomes bent upon openly returning to her musical hobby.	s
You say erb, and we say herb, cuz ther's a f###ing h in it".	s
The three stooges end up going to party where Curly is going to dress up in drags.	s
Nevertheless, I'll give it a go.	s
And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell.	s
Once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters, I doubt you won't like the show.	s
The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs.	s
She works in a bar, doesn't have much money, lives in a crummy apartment.	s
Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie.	s
I for one don't think so.	s
Where have we heard that before.	s
overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump.	s
That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants.	s
When this movie was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South.	s
It also marks the heralded return of Edison Chen, long absent since the Initial D debacle of a year ago.	s
In some spots, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clichés.	s
Macy is such a great actor.	s
I think that Antwone Fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man, but I think that his public popularity will increase with the release of Biker Boyz, which also stars Lawrence Fishburn.	s
Rozsa's score is especially beautiful.	s
At the end of the movie, when you see Alexandre writing, and Veronika asking if he's writing his life,you can guess that he's not, that even literature failed.	s
And that's just to say that he'd be forgotten, too, if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since 1983.	s
Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done.	s
I'm a big fan of the "old-school" late 80s to mid 90s era CATIII films, and I had been hearing that that "style" of films is making a bit of a come-back with films such as this, and Herman Yau's GONG TAU (which as of this writing I have not yet seen...), so I was very interested to give some of these newer-wave CATIII films a shot.	s
Guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile, and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast!	s
Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a nice sizable supporting part as George's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller.	s
Shintaro Katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as Zatoichi, mixing wisdom, deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability, while solid work comes also from Rentarô Mikuni and an effectively baleful Kô Nishimura (later to appear as Katsu's superior "Snake" Magobei in the Hanzo trilogy) as the two main bosses in the film.	s
After her death, Lincoln would frequently visit her grave, to share his life with her 'spirit' (a theme Ford would continue in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon").	s
First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the film's charm.	s
You will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie.	s
She is noticeably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this film.	s
Nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama.	s
How could this happen?	s
When her promiscuity gets her into trouble, it also involves a bystander, Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer.	s
I don't blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so along comes Allison.	s
She really sucks you into her life.	s
However the actress who steals all the show is Hilary Duff!	s
They are beholden to each agent of the "MAN".	s
Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed.	s
But Davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable.	s
Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention?	s
The cast, including an awesome rotation of special guests (i.e.	s
Still it's of interest if you're a Wood fan.	s
Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out, and he just said, "Leave it like that.	s
The sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues, and Capano actually had her psychologist killed.	s
The ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying.	s
Well, I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best film.	s
To reunite with his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti(Mumtaz) who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity.	s
The story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old Japanese play, and it plays itself out as such, combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept, an amazing narrative, and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore.	s
Needless to say, Mat gets dragged into George's world.	s
I'm nitpicking though.	s
Grade: A+	s
The characters are over-the-top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors.	s
Liam Neeson, as usual, is fantastic, a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of.	s
Writer Brian Helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful.	s
Not a film to be taken seriously, but a great little film nonetheless.	s
I could not get a clear idea of what it is LDS views are on central topics of religion.	s
Enjoy, Piper A	s
It simply made death and danger worth while" (screenplay).	s
Most recommended!	s
And "The Dentist" does it better than any other film I can think of.	s
While the story was not as enthralling as it could have been, it was still quite good, enjoyable, and adventurous.	s
The background score is also pleasant.	s
The dialogue never rises above soap opera quality, but the story itself actually changed my view on some things.	s
actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath, its your everyday doctor.	s
That the mainstream media aided and abetted George W Bush is not surprising.	s
It's real, it's honest.	s
I'm not sure why, to be honest, as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states.	s
Characters contemplate on why they're in the Ice Age, while they could have called it The Big Chill or the Nippy Era.	s
This plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that "hey I missed something".	s
Michael Is King.	s
It's hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.	s
I, myself, can't say I had a lot of fun watching it.	s
As the Godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man's point of view.	s
well "Wayne's World" is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies.	s
The ending is very amusing,and Corey Sevier's character was my favorite student!, plus Dolph has still got it!.	s
Yeah, sports fans can be weird, I don't deny it.	s
A man finds a parking spot, and sees a lot of odd couples walking by, wondering why he can't find a girl.	s
In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide.	s
Choosing Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer was the best decision since Gene himself cast Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard.	s
A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven.	s
Overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic.	s
From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one-man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, Laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of CGI  can only daydream about.	s
His jokes are great, and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, are downright hilarious.	s
Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human.	s
Days turn to weeks, and then the summer disappears, turning to fall and then winter, promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping, white winter landscape.	s
And 'The Return of The Soldier' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered.	s
The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties.	s
Louis' character is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character.	s
Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable.	s
You might call it the ultimate soaper, because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material.	s
It's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it.	s
For example, Maria has the following conversation with a peddler (played by Fassbinder himself); the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that "Kleist burns out to quickly, it does not provide enough heat for the cold".	s
The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched.	s
I won't deny that.	s
Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant as well as Watanabe Eriko.	s
brother.	s
Oh yes, I recognized his name (and later on his dim-witted macho-face).	s
Then the movie starts.	s
I recommend the book, but the movie is still entertaining.	s
I think that's the key moment of the movie, not surprising maybe, yet original.	s
One of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy, such as loosing a family member, occurs.	s
Although it is slow at times, its pace is reflective of the story line - but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next.	s
It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films.	s
One scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: Mitchell's telling of Stewart's motivation to Shelley Winters, which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all.	s
I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven't recognised it, when they use phrases like: "Who is Heaton?	s
You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe.	s
he ends up lusting after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who fancies her.	s
I think two segments might really tick off the right wingers (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits; another from UK which recounts the US-backed overthrow of Chile on Sept 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities).	s
Eva La Rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl Cara, Virginia Bryant is indeed bewitching like Richard Lynch states on several occasions and the lovely Sheeba Alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut-shaped hair style (I kid you not!).	s
Hershey and Coburn are not showing their best but they are still good.	s
A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between.	s
That's pretty much the plot, such as it is.	s
Ending with a perfect (sexy!)	s
But when they reunited the baby with its father I just couldn't hold them in anymore.	s
He can't keep the two separated: In his mind Pat is Desdemona and he's Othello, and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him.	s
Sometimes i felt tingles down my spine - so much i loved what i've seen.	s
My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my plight greater than yours.	s
But it is a terrific movie for as old as it is.	s
He cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract, as Iris' brother in law does (suggesting that he "married the wrong sister").	s
That was how I remember my Christmases were with my family - magical.	s
I've seen most of the rest of Sarno's films, and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles, and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best.	s
If you are a fan of kung fu/karate movies, this is a must see... the DVD is available.	s
To think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be.	s
It deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is.	s
Not a single shot of a city or even a fake skyline.	s
I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't.	s
He seems a warm and intriguing fellow, and she's immediately taken with him.	s
This movie is a great movie rental, the special affects where enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated.	s
Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments.The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey.It is journey worth experiencing.	s
Background music score and the songs are outstanding.	s
Terry Gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film.	s
There are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon-to-be-blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom's father removes it from her sight.	s
Something the recent Tomb Raider film lacked.	s
I don't want to say TO much more, I;m not into giving away the plot, but I will say this-the film is VERY realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film.	s
After he has gotten the ship to travel to Talos IV, Mr. Spock turns himself in to Dr. McCoy (the senior-most officer present; Capt.	s
The suspenseful climax finds Raines alone with Tone in his apartment, where she discovers evidence of his guilt  and he confesses to having had an affair with Baxter's wife, but killed her when she wouldn't desert her husband for him.	s
For strength of story alone I cannot recommend this film highly enough.	s
The film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening, and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer/director's faith in an intellectual audience.	s
Partially deaf, Carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome, be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby.	s
But see it !	s
Hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more character-driven charming films like Reign over Me.	s
By the way, this film is packaged along with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"	s
However, it sure has it's surprises in the END!!!	s
Practically, she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits; she, as a wife and a different viewpoint, comes symbolically with the New Year, at midnight.	s
At first, my mom wasn't sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new VHS system she let me watch it.	s
Brent is indicted.	s
I will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link.	s
Like the Inspector, his personality was exaggerated.	s
with only one short spot of colour, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds.	s
That's 35 years.	s
This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".	s
DePalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around.	s
Its crude yet awakeningly fresh.	s
I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder.	s
Then, to top it off (or maybe to justify his perplexing fear of the dog), it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow injures him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later, as a bad storm hits!	s
I think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.	s
This is America, after all.	s
As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace.	s
It is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern, urbanized Americans are.	s
He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out.	s
I remember one episode where as a king Red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness.	s
By itself, it's an insightful film and study on the music industry.	s
I still love how even though this is like the Leave It To Beaver-esquire type of world, there still is a lot of gore in the movie.	s
Its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (remember him?)	s
But I watched an episode and was really impressed.	s
She played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly.	s
Plus Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie.	s
You can see his influences from working under Chang Cheh in this film.	s
Also, those who didn't like Evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable.	s
Davies & Haines are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a hoot.	s
The local Government covers it up, tears down the factory and builds houses over it.	s
But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique.	s
It does.	s
Excellent episode movie ala Pulp Fiction.	s
I'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen.	s
Perhaps not surprisingly, Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from London's east-end - takes a liberty with Fagin by re-interpreting him as a much more benign fellow than was Dicken's original.	s
A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half-way mark.	s
All this was at very high pay, sometimes 'golden time', which was triple our regular hourly wage.	s
This is part one of a short animation clip showing the history of the Matrix, the war between man and machine that resulted in the eventual creation of the Matrix.	s
it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem.	s
The characterizations are fabulous, as good as Sig Rumann's best.	s
Once the killer's identity is revealed, it doesn't seem like such a big surprise, but up till then it's really anybody's guess.	s
She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later.	s
Eight very solid points.	s
This movie was simply too short to do this.	s
George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't.	s
Jeff Bridges is excellent though as the quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are marvelous, carrying the film through most of its rough spots.	s
If it were not for Mr. Bakshi, I don't believe animation would have survived the Disney onslaught.	s
You see magnificent views in every city they go.The director shows you even the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia even though the movie is not relatively long.	s
See this film.	s
The ending was even satisfying.	s
It goes along with the movie wonderfully.	s
The thing I liked about this was that it worked very well as a "MOVIE" and not as a play you are studying.	s
This way our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try-outs.	s
BRILLIANT !	s
www.imperialflags.blogspot.com	s
It's hard to believe this is Ishai Setton's first film.	s
This show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs, gangs, and alcoholism.	s
The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and "humor" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (1987), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with.	s
Besides these prime examples, Disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids, coming up with a lineup called "The Disney Afternoon".	s
He falls victim in the end, as all tyrants do (in books and legends) to love and of the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by the little thief (Sabu).	s
That said, the minute I started watching this, I was captivated.	s
In that, it was quite an achievement.	s
Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from Amsterdam.	s
Rarely have I seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based, but I admit to that here.	s
Well guess what?	s
In fact, I think that I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one.	s
Beyond that, having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation, I can say the situation felt particularly realistic.	s
In USA it was retitled ZENTROPA so audiences wouldn't confuse it with Agnieszka Holland's EUROPA EUROPA from 1990 (equally a WWII drama).	s
Jodie Foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like "a family" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't.	s
This is a great movie that I don't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career.	s
The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me.	s
This little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine.	s
The plot is a simple one but works very effectively, the blurring between child-like fantasy and hard-hitting nightmare is very well blurred.	s
Its a decent, clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind, and a young fan wishes for them to win, since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him.	s
You'll walk out of the theater and never go back!"	s
Stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on.	s
At times she sounds as American as apple pie, but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand.	s
So when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is!	s
As such it is brilliant.	s
The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place.	s
This film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in Montana, by the the Blackfoot river, where the film is played out.	s
I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates.	s
The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless.	s
Often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells.	s
Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him.	s
Who likes contract marriage?	s
I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and a fan of Gackt and Mizer only recently.	s
required hundreds of actors and the British film director truly deserved his Oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner.	s
This was one of the best shows ever made for TV.	s
You cannot not be impressed by this movie.	s
As a crime drama it often falters, especially with the incomplete, ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end.	s
Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie.	s
But it was still a compelling story.	s
The only basic complaints I have is that I wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it.	s
I wanted more story and character development.	s
Further Deponent Saith Not.	s
My parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know, the police got acquitted and LA got burned to the ground.	s
But it's a surprise that pays off because, oddly enough, Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior, or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble, of a small-town Georgian environment.	s
The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example.	s
Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, a washed-up ex-counter-terrorist agent who's taken to the bottle.	s
Scared the hell out of me.	s
Especially for a student film!	s
If you like this go see Nirvana Live!	s
It also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna's "Like A Prayer" video.	s
On the flip side, when Campbell is confined to his lonely New York apartment (which he affectionately calls "purgatory") only to be discovered by a group of Nazis, the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author, and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds.	s
This to me is very much at the core of the Tarzan experience.	s
This is not about things and people that have gone bad.	s
The heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she NEVER MET.	s
And as a result I was quite entertained.	s
In section three, a future Cabell argues with a future Passworthy over the morality of human science.	s
Thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life.	s
If you have the means, I highly recommend viewing this movie It is, by far, the funniest movie I have had the pleasure to experience.	s
A stunning film of high quality.	s
Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed.	s
There is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking Gaelic at times to further this point.	s
This is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of Steven Biko and the journalism of Donald Woods.	s
This is one of his best performances.	s
It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only main difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in L.A.	s
The history of the FBI, as told from the point of view of Agent Stewart via flashbacks, interwoven with his personal life story.	s
One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)	s
The couple live in a posh apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles.	s
I fancy to see this again.	s
For the record, Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.	s
They nearly steal the show...and Ms. Law doesn't even have any lines!	s
Some episodes are on-world, meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth.	s
It seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed "crazy", twisted and turned like a Dali painting.	s
The story moves briskly and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies.	s
You'll enjoy it.	s
Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve.	s
I also thought the animation and character designs were good, and I'm also happy there was more Gadget in it, since he's my favorite character.	s
David survives the crash, but is left with a disfigured face.	s
Andrew McLaglen directed it and I'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh.	s
me and my sister saw the premiere last night... it was so good we were glued for the whole thing.. hahaha..i think I'm hooked for the season!!....	s
Powell is in his habitual elegant and smart form as Philo.He's protagonist of two famed detectives cinema,this one, and elegant Nick Charles along with Nora(Mirna Loy)make the greatest marriage detectives.	s
One word to describe this eye-opener  wow.	s
If noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photography, murder, criminals, mystery, and suspicious women, then we'd have to include all the Charlie Chan movies under that rubric.	s
Lots of good examples in this one, scenes where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress, photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling, just for a second, and more.	s
Part of that has to do with the writing.	s
And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention.	s
It was a different time with a totally different mind set.	s
After the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book "Modesty Blaise" I was surprised the result got this good.	s
Although set in Ireland amid Catholic/Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other.	s
Yeah, it is.	s
If you hate this film so much, don't buy it.	s
I admire the story.	s
Just watch it!	s
The story has a lot of holes in it, perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director.	s
The adaptation is credited to Ms. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, her long time companion.	s
It was a very short movie and I was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast.	s
I like this film a lot.	s
Some very known directors are involved, including: The Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha.	s
This movie does not over dramatize anything.	s
Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.	s
Oh, and the death sequences are the best.	s
Not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film, always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so.	s
But Ms Davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite.	s
The playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange, but is actually employed against evil.	s
Gordon - (Grant Heslov) is a man whose life isn't going very well, as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand.	s
The first time I saw this, I didn't laugh too much.	s
While I watched it, I thought for sure Powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with Arthur.	s
It allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun.	s
It was a movie that treated Science Fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.	s
I love the show but it is with some reservations and I feel it took the easy way out by Spoiler Spoiler: Crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season.	s
These 2 adults give the show a much-needed mature point-of-view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do-wells.	s
There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first.	s
Showtime got the 'clean' version.	s
It truly is one of the greatest movies of all time.	s
Your kids will love it.	s
I think Lars should make RIGET III a little bit different.	s
Although there are no guarantees in life, for anyone, this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotyping.	s
I saw this at a screening last night too.	s
Just give him the Oscar now...he deserves it!	s
Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding.	s
The dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and/or music.	s
Director José Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations, and they're shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola.	s
The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, DECLINE AND FALL, and the rest.	s
Opposing them is the fearless Fuzzy Tomato (like the others, FT was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon) and his human allies.	s
Agent Doyle requests some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood.	s
After writing and producing a few of mentor Roger Cormans' New World films, Demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but has an appealing tongue-in-cheek quality to it as well; it's often as funny as it is flashy.	s
It's got a great sense of foreboding, established right at the outset.	s
The film is five years old and rings more true every day.	s
This film however was mesmerizing.	s
this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition.	s
Scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself.	s
Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring.	s
Franchot Tone, a New York stage actor, working in Hollywood, never found in this medium the fame he deserved.	s
Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best, portraying this maiden of a restrained, polite society with wit and ease.	s
my thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira.	s
Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed.	s
Few films of the late-40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy.	s
In addition to those I've mentioned, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good.	s
I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thank goodness, because Taxi could have killed it.	s
The effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing.	s
By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's choppy, flashy, dizzying editing technique.	s
CROSS AGAIN SHOWS GREAT RANGE FROM COMICAL BEGINNINGS AS THE ALIEN ENTERS A LOCAL BAR AND ORDERS HIS FIRST EARTHLING COCKTAIL, TO HIS RACE WITH THE ENEMY AND THE DRAMA OF WHETHER HE CAN KEEP ANNIE AND THE CHILD SHE IS CARRYING ALIVE.	s
The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's: morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck, vain, neurotic, pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries (and fails) to pursue a floundering solo career, paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt, and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living.	s
David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job.	s
What do I say?	s
and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.	s
Anyway, one of the most successful magazine owners (Played By Jeff Bridges) invites him (Out of nostalgia) to work at his magazine.	s
I got to see this on the plane to NZ last week, and was wondering how it would measure up to both the UK film and the book.	s
This film is one of my top sci-fi films of all time.	s
In general I'm a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians (for example I highly recommend Hard Core Logo) and this film in particular.	s
I give the movie a 7/10.	s
With "Maratonci trce pocasni krug" makes two mythological movies everyone here knows word by word.	s
It should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with Eddie Murphy.	s
It has everything that would make a great picture.	s
When he gets back to his house, he finds out that his brother Mitch(Played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman(Played by Juliette Binoche).	s
But it's "Smooth Criminal" that's the icing on the cake.	s
But the climatic scene in The Last Hunt is as horrifying as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly.	s
The score is so moving, it brought me to tears.	s
In this film, Johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in Yuma once.	s
Personally I think "Soldier" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre.	s
It's nice to see him playing a serious character.	s
One particular rebel, wanted for murder by the English, arrives back into town secretly.	s
As Utopian as it seems, I do believe people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect.	s
Reminiscent of Japanese horror films, such as "The Ring," and "Dark Water," or English horror films, such as "Lady in Black," and "The Innocents," this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror.	s
If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England.	s
So what?	s
Edge comes out with Lita, gives the briefcase to Vince & heads off in the ring as Cena has one more match to go here tonight.	s
This final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film, right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular.	s
It's actually pretty interesting that he played this role, as it seemed like a natural for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (give or take a few).	s
When you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it.	s
It looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well, but does go over the top at times.	s
Clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support the male.	s
Aware that Bill desperately wants to see Rose, Bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first.	s
The photography and scenery are splendid, and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.	s
I liked the look of the film and how shots were set up, and I thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do.	s
As the days, weeks & months begin to pass Jack become more & more insane, Danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family, as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it...	s
It might be hard to find since it's out of print on both VHS and DVD.	s
Deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to Hollywood depictions of the medieval world.	s
Though she cannot see, she is able to find what is out of sight than the "normal" people around her.	s
Cole accepts and the story of the Twelve Monkeys begin.	s
Chaos and mayhem!	s
A good movie.	s
Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie, it is Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano.	s
The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys-, that really... there's no possible match.	s
The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design.	s
ill explain it too you :) This episode is split in 2 parts.	s
I was lucky enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time.	s
They scheme and plan "Zero Day".	s
But while staying true to almost every aspect, Walken's acting made it believable.	s
It was derived from Jimmy Perry's own experiences.	s
The acting is top-notch.	s
Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have Rachel portray Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory.	s
I give 8.5 out of 1o stars.	s
It's an excellent movie with very unexpected story, very good dialogs and crazy humor.	s
While there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, and Walt & Roy did in their eras with the studio.	s
Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show!	s
Despite Cortez being a wimp through and through, for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him.	s
This film is more bizarre than something Ed Wood could have ever dreamt up.	s
But maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death, and threat of violence.	s
I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, be they young or old.	s
Match 7: Tag Team Championship Match Christian and Lance Storm vs Hollywood Hogan and Edge The match started with loud "USA" chants and with Hogan shoving Christian through the ropes and out of the ring.	s
Where the Sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon.	s
However, given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen, I rate Fido 9 out of 10.	s
The concept, which today has been done to death (a slasher film within a slasher film) was at the time relatively cool and original.	s
As Doctor Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier.	s
The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman.	s
Luckily I had stupid babysitters and party-going parents on the weekends.	s
Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based.	s
Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water.	s
Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie--he can't seem to figure out how to play it-- but he's surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof.	s
But rather than seem disingenuous, it makes for some great laughs.	s
He is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but at times a bit transparent.	s
But there are also parts to make you smile, make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more.	s
As to the performances here, those who can't get past the mind-set of Tom Cruise as Maverick in `Top Gun,' or his Ethan Hunt in `Mission Impossible,' or those who perceive him only as a `movie star' rather than an actor, are going to have to think again in light of his work here.	s
This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget.	s

I have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie I needed a breather.	s

It's something of a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Ricky's mom on television.	s

It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle) were my favourites.	s
Jackman is an impressive fellow, glamorous and dashing.	s
That may spoil your mood.	s
Not exactly.	s
I think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond.	s
I don't understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey.	s
The PG rating is well-deserved--not like "Sixteen Candles" where the "f" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene.	s
And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out.	s
In fact, it's fair to say Gerard's comeuppance can't come soon enough.	s
But she's an astonishing looking woman, and much can be forgiven.	s
So, with all that said, how is the movie?	s
Everything about that I think is just so perfect.	s
I remember people were looking for her(family) and that she knew how to take care of herself---she narrates the story and I vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin.	s
gone in 60 sec.	s
I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears.	s
It works primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior.	s
I wanted her to stand up to him, not pathetically chase after him!	s
Could it be that he hates himself.	s
With part reconstruction and part direct shooting, the directors made a formidably limpid documentary on a coup d'état against President Chavez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the wealthy Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the Church (a cynical laughing cardinal) and the US government.	s
Your average punter, I have found just does not write comments like that.	s
Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response most likely will be "Who?"	s
The three quirky, irritable old cops make a brilliant team, applying twenty-year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then - sometimes with effect, at other times to the horror of their senior officers.	s
Sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't try.	s
This movie is as raw and real as you can get.	s
Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and Ernest Borgnine's character go at it with each other.	s
Kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on.	s

Most of all, the perverse plot involves incest and patricide, allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality.	s
Thus, the burden of the story is shared between the film-maker and the viewer.	s

Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.	s

Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself.	s
Brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks.	s
It was all meant to be a farce, but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie, you think to yourself "People like this are all around us" All attempts at getting the audience's sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another.	s
Angela Lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent, and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed (boy, that could be misconstrued, couldn't it?)	s
The Rose Gang is ready to ride again.	s
This movie is one of my very favorites.	s
She happens to be engaged to "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) but that doesn't stop her flirting with Bob.	s

Love, a TV LAND original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "ALL in the Family"...those were the days......	s
one could ask.	s
This film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would, for adults.	s
I'm so glad I happened to see this video at the store.	s
I think all you people are expecting too much.	s
I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and only wish I had known about it years ago.	s

The movie gets quite slow, and the ending is quite stretched.	s
I didn't really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway.	s
What is more important is how good a script this is.	s
To capture the natural emotion that real life offers.	s
And why?	s
It's a rare actioner for Cary Grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense.	s
I am now on 96.	s
It is now one of favourites of all time.	s
As prisons go, the cell was totally unrealistic, so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things.	s
And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.	s
With however some reservations and they're the ones I previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between De Palma's rabid fans and his detractors.	s
And also This short is the first of twenty-five cartoons where Tom speaks.	s
it still in a general area wasn't that good.	s
There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed.	s

The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown.	s
No other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with Steele, and no actress ever will.	s
It has a good storyline and plot.	s
It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films.	s
Beforehand Notification: I'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here, but when I saw the preview for this movie, I was thinking "Finally!"	s

Again, things slow down a bit and get weird.	s

Yeah, I remember this one!	s
The baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth, but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby.	s
I'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement 'Flavia' is trying to communicate: Humanity (the Catholic Church in particular) historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further.	s
Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed.	s
Normally, those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the East.	s
What a terrific job!	s
I'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey.	s
Sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over, sigh, or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something.	s
Never mind though, good gripping story.	s
However this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version.	s
Highly recommended.	s
Still, there are many users who don't like "Succubus" and I can see where they're coming from.	s
The dialogue was a bit much at times; this film had a tendency to get *really* preachy at times, and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness (we really didn't need the US flag with 'UNLEARN' typed onto it, give some credit, we're not morons...).	s
I have read many great reviews of the Synapse (US) release, but I love my German X-Rated Kult DVD copy.	s
What was lacking for me was a coherent storyline.I found it often disjointed, badly edited and at times difficult to follow.	s
Most of his films are below average action movies like Death Warrant and Gunmen.	s
The sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and I think that could have been eliminated or fixed.	s
Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences.	s
Easy to get into and hard to put down.	s
I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi.	s
But Denis lets this man be himself, films him in his self-absorbed quest.	s
He is virtually unsurpassed in this skill.	s
Like Titan A.E.	s
What I enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out.	s
I felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever, it was still very very good.	s
I either really love them or I loathe them.	s
One would think John Waters would have idolized this film.	s
It certainly worked for Jerico.	s
These two TITANS of the British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece!	s
From the World to the Gaels!	s
She was truly amazing in this movie.	s
Jeff Corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men.	s
Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack.	s
Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror.")	s
it definitely should be on more often then home improvement.	s
It is simply a great, timeless adventure.	s
No matter how annoying I find Claire Danes' angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does.	s
The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in a picture about Mother Teresa is as laughable as her character's antics in the pool.	s
What an awesome movie!	s
I'm mean really what is better then a house maid falling in love.	s
The film is about Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole, with Japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies "Mariiines, tonight you die!	s
Things to Come is an historic film.	s
As I watched this short film I was constantly uncomfortable; between the music, bleak scenery, and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by Dominic Monaghan (as Jack), I desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it.	s
I give this movie a rating of "8" (and I'm a harsh grader) It's the Civil War story of renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the North.	s
If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film.	s
This was the second of the series of 6 "classic Tarzan" movies featuring Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane.	s
However i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on.	s

Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part.	s
This whole storyline is cloth.	s
And to all those out there who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded: you are all winners.	s
It's kind of hard to explain, but I'll give it a try.	s
I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it.	s
This is as far from Notting Hill as it's possible to be.	s
Seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating; in fact I found myself wishing I'd seen more of the story, and I imagine we may see a sequel at some point.	s
I've not read the book (maybe that's a good thing & meant I enjoyed the film more) but with regards to the story, I really can't think of any bad points, hence scoring it 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything warrants top marks!).	s
Papich, Aden Young, does his job.	s
Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers.	s
I saw this movie years ago on late night television.	s
He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this.	s
The Maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird-out superhero story.	s
See this show.	s
But Fiona's keeping a secret as to why she hates Barclay so much.	s
Then the twists and turns start.	s
Another beautiful, funny, and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex.	s
The story takes a twist as the three singletons meet Mia--wittily played by Amanda Peet-and all fall for her.	s
I am amazed that movies like this can still be made.	s
A creepy partner of Sloane's is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has Welles' "Michael O'Hara" head spinning.	s
Pabst's manner of "invisible editing" that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles, enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting.	s
She insists she's having a baby.	s
I assume no one took the time to rethink the script.	s
The transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one.	s
Near the beginning of the film, after exiting a performance, Myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named Nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to Myrtle.	s
How many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment?	s
I thought it was Will's best performance to date.	s
She tells him to get lost!	s
Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty apparently committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released.	s
Check this out, and marvel at the greatness of Kira.	s
Not just the animation style but several character designs.	s
Item: Jane's costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath.	s
On a more sceptic note, the series went under a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success.	s
Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was.	s
Well worth your while.	s
The older Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.'	s
Ironies abound in several stories.	s
At one point one of his henchmen murmurs: "No one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves."	s

Literally it means "Dawn please never comes" - when it comes, the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever.	s
Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology.	s
From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty.	s
Even if the animation is limited (and a step down from the artistic streak of the first LODOSS), this 27-part series has its elements of appeal.	s
A really great movie and true story.	s
Director Scola's imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama.	s
I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances.	s
Stop!	s
Mr. Emerlius Browne, (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution.	s
What we get from these four is a plot that is well-balanced and engaging, yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches.	s
The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989.	s
All in all everything was great about this movie (except maybe the feet and noses).	s
And I don't say it in a bad way.	s
One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given.	s
I happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are off-camera.	s
Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it.	s
If I could go back, even as an adult and relive the days of my Summer's spent at camp...I would be there so fast.	s
PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance.	s
McLaglen's performance does not look like much, being as it is about 90% drunk act.	s
The animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not-so-good, but they look pleasant all the same that way.	s
This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say, "Enough already!"	s
The filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative, trying hard not to take sides, never once judging either father or son, painting neither as the villain.	s
Jericho was sub-par but definitely helped Cena launch his career.	s
It is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails.	s
No, no, no!	s
Casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line.	s
Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.	s
They launch a comeback / reunion tour.	s
Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers.	s
It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s.	s
Indeed, it wasn't until Lung enters the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch.	s
i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie.	s
The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive.	s
I grew up with her on The Munsters and I am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies.	s
His aimless character's inability to say no to the ex-wife, boring girlfriend, and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence.	s
The plot is intricate and totally absorbing.	s
Sadly, the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers (I can't think why).	s
People flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop.	s
Final Analysis = = Midrange Material	s
Lasalle is a withdrawn, possessed elderly man, in for brutally murdering his wife.	s
I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews.	s
This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film.	s
Vida's house arrest sees its end, but Wilder is preoccupied.	s
I hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine.	s
This Ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time.	s
I have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best.	s
Haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking dogs.	s
Its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a requirement.	s
In this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot.	s
Well, no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making.	s
Its humor is pathetic!	s
In Frank Sinatra's first three films, he was purely a speciality act: ostensibly playing himself, he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie.	s
I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was.	s
So, pre-interval you have the initially funny, later annoying comedy track of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and post-interval there are the go for your kerchief moments between Aby and Akki!	s
What is there left to say... the first of its kind, and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3D shooters.	s
I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.	s
After Adeline has taken steps to save Fanfan from hanging, she meets the king in his private quarters.	s
While it certainly wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, it was certainly worth the $8 (which can't be said for many movies these days.)	s
We're led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch.	s
Although they do a respectably good job, it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the Japanese OVA cast.	s
By age 5, I had watched it over 400 times.	s
They are not alone in this place.	s
To see Goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic.	s
Had the plot flowed a little better, I could have easily given The College Girl Murders a 7/10.	s
Director Walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant.	s
This is the weakness of this film... After an hour or less it's getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it's more interesting to look at.	s
Back when musicals weren't showcases for choreographers, we had wonderful movies such as this one.	s
It was definitely worth the price of admission.	s
Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one its a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie.	s
Who is behind these crimes?	s
I like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast, to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent, which I respect greatly.	s
It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing.	s
After that, as you could imagine, chaos ensues.	s
The story was actually pretty interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil, and who is using them for good.	s
Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares?	s
I cannot understand why the owners of the rights to this film have not put it on DVD.	s
But, the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film.	s
Originally Released as a 3-hour film.	s
The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining.	s
This was my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always liked her.	s
Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but Randy Edelman's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality.	s
Several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately:  * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family.	s
Jane Lynch!	s
Lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively.	s
His camera, dubbed the Cinematograph, was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps.	s
Maybe you will too.	s
Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly.	s
This genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday.	s
There are some weaker moments, such as the Muppet babies sequence, and Juliana Donald's performance as Jenny is lacklustre, but neither of these problems are too significant, and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience.	s
There are also some moments of dubious camerawork; for example, who is holding the camera when the two Naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station?	s
The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.	s
It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like.	s
Che's capture and death are dealt with well.	s
The acting was decent, the script somewhat out-dated, but the memories were still fresh.	s
Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and I had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, I'm surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!.	s
I absolutely was into it.	s
Suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy!	s
I give this movie a 9.5, because, I am very picky when it comes to books to movies, (I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY).	s
The "failure" (as in, it "only" took in, like, five-hundred-million or something; I know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation.	s
What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have.	s
Even the worst Miike is better than a good many films, though, and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that's worth recommending.	s
Humphries instead played multiple roles in true Peter Sellers fashion, most notably Bazza's overbearing Aunt 'Edna Everage' ( this was before she became a Dame ).	s
His dedication to this role resulted in what I think, is the best movie bio ever.	s
But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can't win.	s
Everything about the movie was amazing...and the acting just took my breath away.	s
Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her (after she cops one hell of a going-over from Kiley).	s
A super finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all.	s
I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list.	s
A delight mini movie, a musical short based on three of Cole Porter's Broadway smash songs.	s
The movie is supposed to be a farce, and funny things do happen, but it doesn't "hang together," perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on.	s
Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty, debonair professional and "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is no exception.	s
It's no "Citizen Kane" but it has its moments.	s
AHA !	s
Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo, a stoner who acts as a father figure to Hyde.	s
She, however, moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth Weismuller wears (plus a bikini top), showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip.	s
The friendship to Kana, a female co-worker of hers, gives her new hope and strength.	s
Egan plays Pym (who in fact contains many shades of author le Carre) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming "a perfect spy".	s
She is engaged to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), a bland man, more out of a resigned duty than actual love.	s
But when the DVD of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie, I decided to give it a try anyway.	s
first part is Tony's "Dream" in his coma.	s
The film , as cinema, is a disaster.	s
Every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream Hollywood hero/thriller flick and this film certainly was different.	s
I've already watch the making of Guinea Pig 1.	s
Diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses.	s
Having watched "Mad about you", once, I was not a fan of Paul Reiser.	s
I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).	s

Ecstasy is an early talkie, and could have very well been a classic film, if released during the silent film era.	s
I'm here to help."	s
I was wrong.	s
It's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart.	s
You will have an experience!	s
This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me.	s
See this movie because it shows that Made For TV movies that are good exist.	s
The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance.	s
For example, the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what McLaglen actually did in earlier years, when he was a world-class bare-knuckles boxer.	s
A close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives.	s
I couldn't disagree more.	s
Perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including Richard Dawkins consider it a near certainty .	s
The quality of the execution is also, obviously, important.	s
We were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod.	s
They concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right.	s
It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus...	s
It has a good message (party girl decides she needs a real job) yet she doesn't completely lose all sense of fun.	s
Arnie says: "Yeah, I'll be back" but the host quips "Only in a re-run" and presses the eject button.	s
I disagree.	s
He's wealthy, educated, from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with Stella's.	s
I believe that the same remark could suit to McDonald-Eddy's pictures.	s
Quite by accident actually.	s
Tom Skerritt is the Rev.	s
Of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character, Rod Randall, was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago.	s
Matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance.	s
I could go on and on, overall a 9 * out of 10.	s
So what were her ( their ) motivations ?	s
Whether or not you like musicals or not, one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long.	s

The Japanese court-martial, out of admiration for their heroism, authorizes that they be given a warrior's death.	s
The movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice.	s
Why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up, try to take his scarf off instead?	s
He's got rough ways, some mean job and no heart.	s
Plus, this game has so much variety.	s
The story features a family of cats, where in the big sister dies, the younger brother sees this and rescues her body, but when she awakens she is left without a soul.	s
Nor are the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.	s
Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not "dumbing down" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.	s
watching him die made me cry for a whole day.	s
Audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march.	s
CGS III is a gorgeous, moving film.	s
Some skits just make you want to gag, and cringe, others skits make you laugh and oddly enough think.	s
It was such a deeply private expose, it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a New York musical.	s
The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.	s
The way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic- there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just don't work, which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part.	s
The script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding.It is a down-to-earth movie with characters one cares about.	s
We're in the middle of an irreverent movie of Fanfan's destiny, the ribald adventures of a sword-fighting scamp and rogue.	s
I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say the image quality is top notch.	s
I felt like the film was also somehow more "complete" and less open-ended (just barely) than some of their work, although that's not to say it had much of anything resembling a forward-moving plot.	s
One thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism.	s
A teenaged Claudia Karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this country's most popular actors in years to come, with future roles in THE BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING THE ENEMY, RISK and the acclaimed TV series THE SECRET LIFE OF US.	s
Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence.	s
They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.	s
This episode was down right creepy as hell.	s
It will bring back your emotions from that day.	s
Rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to Planet Earth... Of *course* Planet Earth is better - it has much much more of the same.	s
I have to believe that the cutting was out of Leisen's hands since the great Duke Ellington's number is savagely chopped, but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look: the 'Sweet Marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing Toby Wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie.	s
This film is a lost gem, a dead-on satire "mockumentary" of the early 90's Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer had just began to fade away into that good night.	s
even though I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight!	s
The acting by Hudson, Stack and Bacall isn't that good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is great...especially Stack...when he smiled my knees went weak!	s
The beautiful story of Stardust is written by by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story.	s
I saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the DVD.	s

In Part 1, in Cuba, the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages, given food and cover, supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution.	s
Only Pamela Landy, she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy, knows that he can't be the one.	s
As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous.	s
For that, I have this movie to thank.	s
We also get to see him running around in drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time!	s
There are no "good guys" or "bad guys," just people of a variety of classes getting by on the best of their wits - just like life only better - and naturally with Shaw, the wit is finely honed from all concerned.	s
The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this show's subtext - people aren't always as they seem, and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds.	s
One final nit, throughout Hey Babu Riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome.	s
The whole film, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, is leading up to this moment.	s
The two come from widely different backgrounds, he's American and she's French, after they talk a bit on the train Jesse manages to get Celine to get off the train and explore Vienna with him.	s

The final scene gives us hope.	s
It is based on actual events, a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the Wilmington, DE/Philadelphia PA region from '96 through 2000.	s
The film plays out like an Ealing Comedy with a terrific feel-good factor throughout.	s
However, Vicky's scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the "regents" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age.	s
Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "The Lady With Red Hair" brims over with old -time show-business flavor.	s
There's a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this INCREDIBLY stupid movie as funny as it is.	s
The way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman.	s
This episode is utterly mind-blowing and shocking.	s
For instance, in one scene, Meadows compares himself to Mother Theresa, but for bonin'.	s
This film proves Hitchcock was not 100% correct.	s
It starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it.	s
not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister.	s
They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night.	s
Like "A mass of music and fire.	s
Moves at a slow, but stead pace.	s
During 'Guerilla' I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality European-style miniseries, which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles's 'Motorcycle Diaries' and go on to take us to Guevara's fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement.	s
What I mean is: Nowadays we are slaves to images!	s
It's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander.	s
Every single one of them desired peace in the end, no matter how far apart they've become.	s
It is one of the strangest couples ever.	s
Was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March lineup.	s
all the while building the story.	s
How can people give this a low score and still go and see Titanic without a guilty conscience I do not know.	s
The plot is real horrific, the atmosphere really depressive, unusual for a low-budget production like that, and at least, for a German production.	s
It takes guts to make a movie on Gandhi in India ,in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.This movie shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent father(at least in the eyes of his son).	s
Mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded German-Guy Victim No.	s
He has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind.	s
The film works quite satisfactorily, with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves.	s

I am a college student studying a-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother.	s
On that level, it works, but it's not quite powerful enough.	s
Visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on American's contemporary thematics : "The Bourne Ultimatum" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick.	s
A very good effort.	s
Weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys.	s
But Curtis just seems to give up.	s
Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and juvenile.	s
CITIZEN KANE was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by Hollywood insiders themselves.	s
When I saw this film in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist too.	s
It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's funny.	s

I prey to god he doesn't do the proposed Necropolis, written and directed by ADD sufferer, the ever crap Paul Anderson.	s
Ethan Hawke also brings Hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left.	s
I can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes!	s
The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors.	s
xD	s
Instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character, further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack.	s
I think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did.	s
In many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically, the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times.	s
One of the most pleasant movies you'll ever see!	s
I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release.	s
It is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors' version on DVD.	s
When he sees an ad for Connecticut living, he decides to take a look.	s
And it's really funny.	s
Watch the movie for complete details.	s
Supposedly set in America this was very obviously shot in England.	s
In the movie,e vents are explained by a different characters point of view.	s
Not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form, but every time you attack, you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time.	s
I found this to be intriguing.	s
I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep.	s
Brilliant, even.	s
Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon.	s
Personally I love the program, but there are some huge faults with it.	s
Well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real persons, full of humour sense and credibility!	s
Everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit, which makes it a priceless experience.	s
Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people.	s
What are you expecting?	s
Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was a wonderful touch too as played the semi-serious role of a carny very well.	s
Wonderful.	s
Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some respects as Wild Style, is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample/DJ-based music and electro-club culture.	s
Needless to say, few of these excursions pass uneventfully.	s
I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth.	s
His timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled.	s
It's at Fred's circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart.	s
This left only the main event which saw WWE Champion face Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as the guest enforcer.	s
Scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies, but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of American cinema in both ideological realms, we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism.	s
I've long been a fan of her work, and this is no change.	s
This is a terrible story that's really weak and unfunny Jon Pertwee annoyed me, however the ending surprised me a little bit, and Ingrid Pitt was great as always, however it's just dull, and has been done before many times, plus where was the creativity??.	s
The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen.	s
Gunga Din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades.	s
Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones... how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by Sidney Lumet.	s
i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.	s
This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt.	s
This film came to me under the title of "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see an alternate name is "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would have helped sell the film more effectively.	s
The first time I watched it, I had to watch it again instantly, and I did.	s
Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated since babies.	s
All of the misery and cruelty is their, but non of the humour, irony, and savage lampoonery.	s
I know fans of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.	s
He has alredy won the Daytime Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series (Even Stevens).	s
She brings to life most convincingly the tough little Aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight.	s
I am Black American and I loved this soap opera.	s
Critique: Haunting first debut feature from British director Bernard Rose.	s
I cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.	s
The story is a bit trite, but handled so beautifully that you don't notice.	s
The special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre.	s
Had I known more, I probably wouldn't have viewed the picture with an open mind.	s
The question is how dose the compare with Psycho?	s
It aired on TV yesterday, so I decided to check it out.	s
There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film; Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food.	s
That said, the movie's realistic though and really worthwhile watching.	s
That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.	s
Intense, repeat intense, focus was on Ben and stays there.	s
What looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle.	s
Having seen the original I must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie.	s
May be this will help the movie a tax-free status.	s
The synopses of the stories was so appealing that I went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when I eventually found a copy.	s
Yes, my friends, watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard.	s
Given his support, she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the Minister of Culture, Joseph Goebbels, a known womanizer.	s
Metal Rules...	s
Still, will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story?	s
Leslie Cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that he's too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire...	s
A director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it's all natural, but they didn't do that.	s
Lewis manages to evoke pity (for her character's station in life) as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young.	s
So, from a historical point of view, it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing.	s
Sleeping in clay Then they all went away In one of their UFOs.	s
The main film is centered around the song and music video 'Smooth Criminal.'	s
Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years.	s
I didn't think I would like a children's novel; plus, the other couple of books I was forced to read for the class were really bad.	s
That part might bother younger children.	s
Like "Mad Max II", "The wild one" and many others.	s
We look for a movie that is starting soon and "The Grinch" comes up.	s
Very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world.	s
It's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason.	s
Director John Ford, for all his capability, was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material.	s
Otherwise, while not a beautiful movie to watch, it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution (as opposed to the geisha).	s
Director John Carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in Halloween.	s
To my knowledge, this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims.	s
This movie was charming.	s
Although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny.	s
Then I learnt that the scripts were identical to "Good Times".	s
Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr.Dalton!!	s
I had no idea I could ever find (ick) the idea of beastiality erotic.	s
The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named "La Jetée" (1962) which I haven't seen, but I must thank the director and writer of the movie, Chris Marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of "Twelve Monkeys".	s
However, in the end the most interesting and (indeed surprising) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its maturity.	s
It teaches you lessons, such as never forget who you are, you can do whatever you stick your mind to, and to brave and daring.	s
From beginning to end it oozes class.	s
It is stimulating, thought provoking, a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples.	s
Although there's nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast, which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time, (Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Martin Balsam, Eli Wallach, John Carradine, and even early appearances by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and Nana Visitor!)	s
With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.	s
The characters are very realistic most of the times, sappy sometimes, but quite believable.	s
They Gave Him A Gun stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only film they ever made together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both.	s
Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS.	s
The two captains disagree, arguing about the plan.	s
this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous.	s
Many great British actors are in this film as young men.	s
Many genres, periods and directors are all examined, discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director.	s
Tony Soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff, torn between familial duty and a need to keep his "business" on an even keel.	s
The story is much edgier than any other musical I have seen: cannons hidden up the missing legs of females, and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale.	s
So, he called upon God one night about this.	s
I know it sounds boring, but comedically, she fits perfectly.	s
There's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and Robert Englund's cameos are short, pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America's Funniest Home Videos kind of way.	s
Pick this up the next time your at blockbuster!	s
They help keep me on task of what I want to do.	s
Unfortunately the ship sets course after the shipmates have returned, upsetting Sherry and leaving her to think Bake was still being a typical sailor looking for a good time when he's on land.	s
A terrific, fun film!	s
Then something wonderful happened.	s
None of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film.	s
I had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 Moving Picture Festival In Birmingham, Alabama.	s
Like George Bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world.	s
The story is wonderful, as we peak into Hayao Miyazaki's animation which has no limits.	s
Great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well.	s
There are many good things they do, and a number of bad choices, but they never turn their backs on family, they work through problems.	s
Does anyone remember what state this happened in?	s
I sincerely hope Stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles.	s
The better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming.	s
Sometimes I got impression, that she *is* Camille.	s
I've watched many a Cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all.	s
You certainly won't rewind back to the start and watch it all again, but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come.	s
All in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second-tier actors.	s
Overall, I give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug.	s
Even as Carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell (the room full of whining infants), he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses.	s
But Knox puts in that kind of performance--a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer.	s
The opening is instantly kinetic, with rapidly-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach.	s
I thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline.	s
We all know of Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated.	s
Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much.	s
Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants.	s
The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some "intelligent" space (the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me).	s
However, in this film I must admit that they were great--not only dancing competently but I actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by Edward Everett Horton very nicely.	s
The mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes.	s
Estimable designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy, providing a perception of reality, augmented by matchless sound editing, with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director's fascinating visual compositions.	s
The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation.	s
Gosh, didn't Russell's talent even in 1993 shine!	s
Meanwhile, Rene, a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return.	s
Like the other colonial powers of this time (post WW II leading into the 60s), France had struggled to keep up appearances overseas.	s
She says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit.	s
The supporting cast also does a fine job.	s
In the period that this film was made, people in America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things we have today, except the Radio and the starting out of great films being made in Hollywood.	s
because that film I need at home to watch several more times!	s
If you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store, then make sure you pick it up.	s
Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance, presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good!).	s
Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini.	s
Richard Linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies.	s
And also I did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much "action".	s
Madge Sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower, and so do Veronica Cartwright (as Jones' wife) and Brad Dourif, especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion.	s
I don't remember anyone in the film saying those words, and it should have an "s".	s
The solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters, the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of Fritz Lang produced another epic ahead of time.	s
I'm a great horror fan, escpecially of Clive Barker's stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story.	s
For all genders, all ages, it's a lovely piece of family cinema.	s
We can see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way.	s
Chance - who wouldn't love a dog like Chance?	s
I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it's not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong.	s
There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching.	s
accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy.	s
He wakes up in a different sort of cell (very high-tech and very big), where he finds another cell-mate, who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride.	s
The camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur.	s
The script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter.	s
This is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by Von Sternberg, providing the greatest irony in Alexander's character in every way he can.	s

Reading some other reviews here... Get a life.	s
And to those who just didn't get, well, I can't blame them, too much.	s
An excellent film for those into period dramas, the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film.	s
Too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape, and violence.	s
The film looks at an unusual case of parentingwhere an idealist parent places receding goalposts for a less-than-brilliant offspring.	s
Brilliant and graceful Cristina Hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role.	s
In her diary, she did have two more boys and they lived.	s
The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery Atlantis, not just the discovery of people.	s
This film certainly reinforces that impression.	s

It DOES look good.	s

It's a funny business, reviewing movies.	s
Nobody truly dies, no gore, no blood, no torture, so it certainly is appropriate for children, much more so than many Saturday morning cartoons.	s
This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos, and I have seen them all.	s
This movie is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which became to me the most fantastic place of London) to the journey to Naboomboo.	s
I say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography.	s
Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse but Paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while Beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like, selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult.	s
Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of "White Fire", but it sure is a lot of fun to watch.	s
NOW I'LL BE GENEROUS AND WILL HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY: ALTHOUGH IT WAS TRANSLATED AS A GENERAL "FOURSOME", THE WORD "&#269;ETVORKA" HAS ANOTHER MEANING: IT'S A SPORTS TERM USED TO DESIGNATE A 4M OR 4W SETUP - A ROWING CREW CONSISTING OF 5 PERSONS: 4 ROWERS AND A COXSWAIN.	s

Why to get a mature, thoughtful, well-acted material we have to switch to HBO or FX?	s
Both psychological battleships loaded for bear.... Bravo to author, director, cast, and camera crew.	s
It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists.	s

I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites.	s

The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office.	s
Simply well written, directed and acted... Woody's best of the 2000's if not his best since the 80's!!	s
The Acting is awesome!.	s
Rest of the cast do OK i guess.	s
In a calm scene, it's more calmer.	s

Well, we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig, or pull guns and beat down a record company exec, but you get the picture.	s

The actors are all first rate in the film from Gilbert Barnett as David's second son Absolom through to the wonderful Susan Hayward as Bathsheba.	s
Many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a great "Bicycle Thief" homage") and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.	s
The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes!	s
oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird.	s
Sexual tension between the sisters.	s
Schwarzenegger is on top form as Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond-belting one liners was completely inspired-thety are truly leg-end-dary (with his rant to Killian over a camera the main highlight).	s
The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the gorgeous Saffron Burrows, to Alan.	s
It's the best scene in the film as Gilchrist encourages Judy to keep at it.	s
Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming .	s
Incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th.	s
I watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it.	s
If you haven't already, you most definitely should.	s
Would I rent it again?	s
The first "Saturday Night Live" show, featuring Chevy Chase, elicited instant remarks of, "that's the guy from "The Groove Tube" ", so it was a precursor for Chevy.	s
I watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that I missed on the first viewing.	s
All three have mishaps, the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house, just as the men have left for the day.	s
It remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and, with the possible exception of "Kind Hearts and Coronets" is my personal favourite among the Ealing comedies.	s
This is a hard-boiled Warner Brothers film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck.	s
Everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.	s
I like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it's a film that is very very very nice to see, alone or with someone.	s
This film is a well acted entertaining suspense with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater.	s
If I have one negative comment it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing Count.	s
Hugh and Aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view.	s
It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work.	s
The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print.	s
Loved that scene with the icicles, absolute classics potential.	s
Stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon.	s
I got it, but wasn't laughing very much.	s
Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments - near the end - when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve.	s
For those that enjoyed (?)	s
Because the narrative demands it."	s
The police superintendent Ferrot (Yves Montand) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone.	s
I won't bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better.	s
He never saw the film before and "doesn't like those Italian Oldies..." Like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder.	s
Some of the acting is extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter for instance.	s
You are the best!	s
Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style.	s
My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH WATCHING!	s
The horror you create in your own mind.	s
Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen and I love it so much that I've memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks wind) and even with the script in my head I still like to watch it for Jerry Lee, that German Shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who's smarter.	s
It is noticeable that Salazar hesitated in some needed guidelines to the actresses, but an impressible act is shown anyway on the screen, especially by Monica Cervera, which played in his former short film.	s
Loved Joan.	s
That is his theme.	s
I almost wondered if Miike might dip into (bad) Spy Kids territory, quite frankly.	s
Once you get over the image of squeaky clean Pat Boone, as a supposedly bad boy, you'll have no trouble with the rest of the film.	s
Those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty since the "worms" are realistic enough to cause churning of more than a few in the audience.	s
amazing just amazing.	s
but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them.	s
Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly.	s
One of my favorite appearances was by Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around her home island of Themyscira ("Paradise Island").	s
Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953's much superior 'Pickup on South Street') and the great Alfred Newman scores it.	s
They also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster.	s
As for Mr. Hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills.	s
I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD.	s
It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this.	s
It is a western that deserves nothing less.	s
Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to entice Robert into sex.	s
At first Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 are trick or treating but realises this can't be right when Marvin drastically enlarges Bug's rabbit hole with a ray-gun.	s
The Unborn in My opinion is a really creepy film that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange!	s
I maybe biased about this movie.	s
Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes").	s
Really good effort.	s
The film does not rise to the level of art, and thus cannot hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than mere entertainment, and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn.	s
i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.	s
I think they needed a bit more back story for that one.	s
I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year.	s
The characters are likable and funny, the girls are hotter than hell.	s
Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic.	s
Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as Cupido' and Martha Mattox as Doña Bernarda Brull.'	s
Its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind.	s
Ibéria shows an even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music.	s
Here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways.	s
Sadly, Tony passed away on February 27th 1995 of AIDS related cancer.	s
His energy is visible and so is his age!	s
A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch.	s
When you start watching this animation-masterpiece, you quickly notice, that it's a European production.	s
I must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors, who managed to sound really Majorcan.	s
should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine.	s
And it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend had him followed and photographed.	s
If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldn't have HAD a "Vogue" phase, I know that now.	s
Upon The Straight Story release in 1999, it was praised for being David Lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal.	s
I enjoyed the film with some reservations.	s
He's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart Maisie (Muriel Angelus) are playing with a pistol.	s
Oh course, it is Candy's delivery that sells it.	s
Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.	s
There is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of 'Don del Oro'.	s
Icy and lethal ace hit-man Tony Arzenta (a divinely smooth and commanding performance by Alain Delon) wants to quit the assassination business, but the dangerous mobsters he works for won't let him.	s
the male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit.	s
Never have the machinery behind a spy, and/or traitor, been told better!	s
Not possible for so much talent to reside in one person.	s
Mr. Carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time.	s
LOL.	s
They take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again, which I dislike because its not reality.	s
The startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut.	s
She used to practice, but only when George was out of the house on the golf course.	s
God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.	s
There's hope somewhere.	s
As a fan I didn't care for either Jackson's or Bakshi's depiction of Lothlorien -- again, I feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation I've come across of a beautiful, slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time -- and I feel that Bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong, but I do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the Company relaxing together after their travails in Moria.	s
The only character representation I was bothered by was Sam's; he was made to look unbecomingly silly.	s
Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece who is a competent, but not so confident mathematician.	s
This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find.	s
Ever eager to support films showing our Navy's best side the U.S.S.	s
The cinematography was acceptable.	s
Salman Khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses.	s
The way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible.	s
This is the story of a hit-man named Hauser(Cusack).	s
Then, when Harris comforts Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior.	s
But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.	s
If you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here.	s
This is Wes Craven, embodied in Jackson Ripner, through Cillian Murphy, bashing all brainless chick flicks... Mr. Craven, I salute you.	s
Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice.	s
Then one of the boys asks, "Why did he say, 'alley oop'?"	s
It is a piece of American history.	s
If you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales (the "Pretty Woman" variety love story), here is a beautiful film in which a Japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic, dispassionate life when he falls in love...with dancing.	s
In fact, there are lots of nice people here, people who, in a lesser film or story, would be snarling and back-stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else.	s
I gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie, but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience.	s
In a great way, with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors, hip intelligence, darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: "Grosse Pointe Blank".......now that's a compliment in my book!	s
A very good companion piece to this excellent movie is "White shadows in the south seas" (1928) Geograpically the mirror image to "Eskimo" it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of Western culture/technology on an unsuspecting people.	s
Eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city, and that he must move away from Dominick.	s
Marisa Tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy, showing a magnificent body.	s
They do all the things that fathers and sons are suppose to do in life...they are just doing them much later in life.	s
I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living.	s
Yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention.	s
This is especially true with humans(Riders of Rohan, tavern people etc.)	s
To watch this film from start to finish without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith, as one has to keep saying to oneself, "it's old", "it's a classic", "be kind", not because the movie is so bad, but because at its best it's so good.	s
A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that.	s
A lot of expensive little details.	s
However, the Count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful, as she is infatuated with the Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall) at Court, with whom she is having an affair.	s
This is absurd...The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio...was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point.	s
The end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy.	s
As she drifts off into unconsciousness, Feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife.	s
For all that Hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it, this one is well told and, except that it's too long, I enjoyed it.	s
The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me.	s
All the while, I really enjoyed this, I had a blast, and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising, but this wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped.	s
Jessica Lange, as Mary, gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering, dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure.	s
In his debut film,Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare.The cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent.	s
The film begins with Bill's life falling to pieces.	s
Some didn't, but the most impressive shots (big waterfalls) did, luckily.	s
The cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, highlighting Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell.	s
Don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great).	s
However, the IMDb voter leans to the geeky, and "Paulie" doesn't qualify for that.	s
Hrm-I think that line was from the old movie posters.	s
Visually, it's incredible.	s
This longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in Supremacy, but just works better in Ultimatum (better script).	s
This should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless.	s
Zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment, it delivers a message about its specialised subject school shootings.	s
Afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.	s
The generic overalls, bleached-white Shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete Michael's generification.	s
I like how this show will take us through the day-to-day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they've allowed their lives to become.	s
Mary sees an Indian (in full headdress) and raises an alarm -- spoiling a scene that the movie company is filming.	s
The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I'm guessing about a 60 degree rise.	s
Now as for the REAL James Corbett, read on if you aren't afraid of finding out how the movie isn't accurate.	s
This is one of my favorite comedies ever.	s
The mill, which once employed 45,000, has seen its numbers dwindle to 5,000 recently and now 1, as the plant just shut its doors, leaving a single security guard.	s
I will say no more, because I do not want to ruin the movie, but I strongly recommend this movie.	s
I happened to have enjoyed it greatly.	s
I think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment.	s
I also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories.	s
The fiancé inspires pity and is not merely a brute: he loves Lucienne, but is a limited man who can't cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men.	s
As the couple's weak relationship falls apart, a larger story plays out in the background.	s
Villa "Paradise-Paranoia", true to the Moliere tradition from which it is partially derived, is a heartwarming, multi-layered, serial-comic psycho-drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to attain the kind of general international outreach it richly deserves.	s
Wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments.	s
Hilarity ensues.	s
I was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l'Anglaise, in this beautifully acted, intellectually and visually compelling film.	s
The league consists of Jeremy dyson, Steve pemberton, mark gatiss and the lovely Reece shearsmith.	s
A heartwarming film.	s
Two months on the run, including an aimless "vacation" in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car.	s
Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years.	s
He is much more than any 007 that is for sure and I look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature.	s
The gorgeous Sonia Braga is great as Madonna, and Raul Julia hands in a wickedly funny performance as Strausmann, the man behind the dictator.	s
The peek at small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.	s
It's a wonderful and heart warming true story...take your tissues but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be.	s
Little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak!	s
Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment, and yet it is not too inappropriate to utilize it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one.	s
William H. Macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents.	s
I am shocked.	s
The Wooden Horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, Eric Williams, and is, by far, the best POW escape story ever made into a movie.	s
One is about the retarded girl, who doesn't dare to pass the street to the next block.	s
In summary, don't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is, a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures.	s
None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care.	s
Later, he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him.	s
Lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene, and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental, ending up talky and didactic.	s
On the day of the California Presidential Primary, between midnight and 1:00 AM, the spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to USA.	s
They are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women.	s
The only thing I would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to lighten up a little.	s
All of his great virtues are here: the cramped interiors broken up by gliding, complex, delicious camera movements; a melancholy deployment of light and shade; remarkable, wistful sets by Alexander Trauner, which are so evocative that they, as the title suggests, take on a shaping personality of their own; the quietly mournful music of Maurice Jaubert; a seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time, in this case Louis Jouvet and Arletty.	s
I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano: 5/5	s
Anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation(the magnifying glass from her Happy Meal incidentally comments on Marie's flat chest), but the tadpole(Marie thinks she's better than Anne, better than a water lily) points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat.	s
It starts slow, however, the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story.	s
This isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.	s
When I found the movie in the schedule for Christmas, its title did not sound familiar to me since I have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film.	s
After several episodes, no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock.	s
The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City.	s
The weird thing about the Segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why.	s
It is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons.	s
SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence.	s
I even bought several of his CD's.	s
Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role.	s
B Movie?	s
Excellently acted, well directed, but strictly within its soap genre.	s
The lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character).	s
i wasn't a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener.	s
She makes the too-perfect girl completely lovable, if not completely realistic.	s
If you're amused by straight-faced goings-on that are logical within a given illogical situation, you'll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute Spanish film.	s
The script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding.It is a down-to-earth movie with characters one cares about.	s
At the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace.	s
The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity.	s
The cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think.	s
Today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited James Stewart, as Sale's nephew/assistant.	s
Things become more complicated when Brady lies about Doolittle knowing a famous musician, Jose Iturbi, who is in residence at a film studio, and claims that Doolittle has set up an audition for Abbott, who is a singer and actress, in front of Iturbi.	s
This movie is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator.	s
This film lingered and lingered at a small movie theater in town, and the word-of-mouth buzz got me to see it.	s
You can guess the results.	s
Although the sardonic Julian (ironically surnamed "Noble") appears to be a "tough guy" on the surface, underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities, a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless.	s
Then, in the late 60s, while the big Hollywood studios were on the ropes, Italy,France and England were turning out movies to fill the void left by Hollywood's decline.	s
I should admit first I am a huge fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that is the reason I came watching this film.	s
The critics are dumb.	s
Morales' portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a wonderful glimpse of William's heroic father.	s
They represent the hippie child, the political activist, and the active military personnel.	s
Unfortunately , like many good animated shows ,this one was short -lived .	s
This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen: I glowed inside throughout the whole film.	s
I hope I come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon.	s
Man On Fire" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic.	s
Baker as his put-upon sister also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers in one scene, it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasn't.	s
Very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away, and then finding the bloody body afterward.	s
Loved Adam in the lead..he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the zingers he lets fly from Cohen's script.	s
References are made to the fact that now, with declining wages, both partners need to work, the implication being that there's nobody left at home to care for the kids.	s
The acting was fresh and vibrant, the characters engaging, and the jokes genuinely funny.	s
People are being too hard on the film.	s
Prince's Oscar for music was richly deserved (many people don't know he won one).	s
They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first.	s
Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers.	s
German residents will understand what I'm talking about.	s
It's basically the events of 'The Lion King' as told from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective.	s
There is no question that the two feel devotion, caring and love for each others, yet it goes beyond that of friendship, family and lovers.	s
The scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue.	s
Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films.	s
The Western inter-titles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how Hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day.	s
And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she didn't deserve to die, but she is in Heaven now, all good people go to Heaven.	s
It didn't seem too interesting at first, but as I watched more and more, ever night at 9:00, I would just be so into it.	s
We've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.	s
Typically, in a horror film, horrible and frightening things will happen, but on the margins of civilized society: abandoned houses, deserted hotels, castles, churchyards, morgues etc.	s
By the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up!	s
Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney (Corbin Bernsen of "The Dentist") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, Abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff.	s
And this is the film you should do it with!	s
The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is no bad thing, and I think a lot of the dialogue, while priceless in Tap is funnier here, probably because I'm more into rap than rock theses days, so my own judgment does cloud that point.	s
It's "Donnie Darko" before there was ever such a thing.	s
While certainly a funny movie, Falk's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used.	s
I would definitely recommend seeing "Castle in the Sky."	s
She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extraordinarily well.	s
People were so tough on this movie and they hadn't even seen it.	s
The acting is well done, although nothing about this film is oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film.	s
Why go on and live a life that you thought that you wanted or thinking you are doing the right thing and you both be unhappy.	s
Unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't Carpenter use more of this??)	s
I would not recommend this film for people with short attention spans; it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend that there maybe a kernel of truth in this story.	s
Maybe I would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part, it made sense.	s
Whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice, crashing planes into buildings, subjugating women, condemning whole races, or just plain on torture and murder, we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society.	s
A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more.	s
I always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea.	s
As terrible as it was, it was the most exciting time of their lives.	s
Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering Helen Markham.	s
There is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me that's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that's it when it comes to that.	s
So what do we see?	s
My Rating: 8 stars out of ten.	s
But what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can?	s
The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel.	s
This is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything French and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe.	s
Kirk follows him.	s
The animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was utilized for Batman: The Animated Series' fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures).	s
A great example of classic American film fare that has stood the test of time.	s
Brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism.	s
So, you know the expected audience, right?	s
is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional Brokedown Palace.	s
It traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart).	s
She even grabs the romantic attention of a State department official.	s
Static 2D in a 3D world.	s
In other words, her beauty shows inside and out.	s
I'd love to see it again!	s
Some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds.	s
Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is "Presented in Shaw Scope", just like the good old days.	s
I can't pick my favourite Looney Toons character, because they've changed over the years.	s
I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it.	s
The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche, Sally Field, and Michael J.	s
The charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful!	s
It reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other.	s
Sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top, but 90 % of the time she is a riot!	s
Shahid & Amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar.	s
This was the more small-scale of the two versions, being made for television rather than the cinema, and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast.	s
While it does cover the majority of Bettie's young life, it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path which is something most biographical films seem to lack.	s
Out of the three, she gives everyone a run for their money.	s
Fabrizio Sforza's gnarly make-up f/x, Simon Boswell's splendidly spirited spooky'n'shuddery score, and the dank, dark, cobweb-covered cellar set all hit the skin-crawling spot.	s
It is my opinion that many (and i mean, MANY) comics have lifted, okay outright stolen, so much from this show if not from Sandra herself.	s
While it would be rude to state that Miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value, it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter, dis-impassioned characters.	s
And in good right.	s
Damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity.	s
Excellent story about teenagers, leaders, high school football "stars".	s
At first I was seriously scared because I was hoping that it would not end up like Bobby, which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it.	s
I have nothing more to say, but to suggest this film to anyone.	s
The cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex Yu cinematography.	s
Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest.	s
We never see her hair throughout the film, nor do we ever get a hint that she still has much.	s
This does it no harm in my view, and I wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this.	s
Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director.	s
Of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but I remember being real worried about the invisible monster.	s
Different from movies like "Taxi driver" or "Rambo" which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the Vietnam vets.	s
It really shows how these people lived back then just to surf.	s
She sings Get Thee Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I Are Here, But Where Are You, both with real feeling and class.	s
The story takes place over the Christmas holidays, and, despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies a great deal of Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc).	s
There are several other elements which make 'An Itch in Time' pure Clampett.	s
I have the Highest Respects for Will Smith as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film.	s
And most Changes form pilots to Harley motor cycle rs.	s
Before this little black-and-whiter, the touchy topic of criminal rape never made it onto the American screen.There were lots of these topics that Hollywood and the Production Code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960's.	s
Conclusion: Okay episode, not very memorable.	s
We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator.	s
It shows you that transvestitism is a feature, rather than the entirety of one's being.	s
Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you don't have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster.	s
So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check out this telemovie.	s
i two came home from school fast as i could to catch HRpuff and stuff on t.v.	s
It's ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres, and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere, is nothing short of fantastic.	s
In fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence.	s
Like TTM, there is much inventive camera work.	s
I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here.	s
His eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he did himself, and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary.	s
the 360's are awesome, the circle, Red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie.	s
But what a star, of course.	s
cats think they are seeing each other disguised as Mammy and then they both attack her on the "rear" - lol.	s
And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst).	s
James Cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since Encino Man.	s
The version that I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film.	s
FREEBIRD was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting.	s
Highly recommended.	s
They should be rewarded with Emmys.	s
I must admit to those that haven't seen it.	s
Our hero says yes to option 2, and then the actual story commences.	s
Overall, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for TV.	s
Although there's hardly any action, the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality.	s
Silk Stockings turned out to be a big disappointment.	s
Ray and the cast perform well, individually; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) the most memorable pair.	s
It is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects.	s
Claire Danes, who I did like before (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy her even more.	s
On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy-handed, as when Machaty piles on the imagery, particularly in the final, ode-to-labor sequence.	s
This is not cheap cardboard British Science Fiction, but worthwhile Epic Filmed Opera, sans singing, that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings.	s
I was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father!.	s
As expected, some items had not held up as well as others.	s
The story is beautiful and relates much to the Indian system of Arranged marriage which I too would like to be a part of.	s
Never do they use "It's", "I'll" or "That's."	s
There are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other, but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding.	s
You're with Sky as he argues with Sarah against reason, steadiness, pipes and safety.	s
There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes.	s
What would you do if you were all alone in the world?	s
I mean "what are you afraid of?	s
Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences.	s
Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it!	s
Mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity, and not before long we're whisked off along with her on her big screen adventure.	s
Brenda Fricker is the surprise wonder in it, though.	s
Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic.	s
Unfortunately for all involved, that someone is Dan's brother, Mitch (Dane Cook).	s
That kept me guessing for a while.	s
In fact I loved being an actress in this movie.	s
This is some funny stuff.	s
I can't wait for the next in the Cities of Love.	s
So when writer/director Hal Hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a film was born.	s
WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 -- Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA  Kane vs. MVP in an Inferno match: So this is the fourth ever inferno match in the WWE and it is Kane vs. MVP (wonder why was it the first match on the card).	s
It's all there.	s
This series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced!	s
It is hard to say enough about the logic and light-hearted fun this movie's makers have generated; it is one of the best-liked of all sports biography films, and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well.	s
The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she´s very good in her leading role.	s
This is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it.	s
I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same.	s
Do not feel you have to read Mother Night to appreciate the film; though, if you haven't read Mother Night, you will probably want to after viewing the film.	s
Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York City before it became gentrified with yuppies.	s
I couldn't ask for more than that.	s
It is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand.	s
It sounds misconceived, but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow.	s
This is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique -rather than flashy camera angles etc.	s
While this is going on, Anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever, and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing.	s
One of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century.	s
What real people--goes to show you how cultural differences (the Japanese setting) is less important than the human similarities.	s
I can't figure out why WWE did not announce this till now.	s
We don't buy into the merchandise angle and have our son wearing everything Dooblebop.	s
The film has aged well.	s
with very little screen time and money, Dan Katzir manages to do so much.	s
Coleman's was my favorite performance in the film.	s
When we first meet Early in the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual.	s
Even the ads were locally produced, featuring Wally outside Grumpy's Bar, holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- "Ahh...over to you, Steve Sedahl."	s
Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid.	s
Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable.	s
Red Eye is definitely a must-see and is definitely worth spending your money on.	s
At least the Mr. Moto series ended on a very positive note.	s
Upon meeting with the Realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs, she finds out that she and an old priest are SUPPOSED to be the only tenants.	s
Thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally.	s
This should have been the role that copped it for her!	s
A few times Fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background, and we see Maria walking around her family house, hustle and bustle going on around her, and the radio speaks of a divided Germany, of things still very unsettled, of a disarray.	s
I'll bet you watch it twice.	s
When I went into the theater I didn't know what to expect much more than a moustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.	s
So, he has only one choice to host the game, with a thousand dollar tab.	s
It has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely landscapes of England.	s
As the summer winds down, the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course.	s
They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore.	s
This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.	s
But that just makes Streep's work all the more remarkable.	s
Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring, unenergetic, and disappointing.	s
The bountiful, essential locale, fierce way of life and ripened native women make not only the Frenchman, but us, too, forget any threat, and we have the feeling of him as a free man.	s
As Elvira would say "I guarantee it'll be a scream!	s
Personally, it spawned a collection for me.	s
In these times of terrorist threats and state response, such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern.	s
I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was.	s
This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time.	s
Yes, i's mostly comedy, but there are some sad moments.	s
Spanish films are into a, if not Golden, definitely a Silver Age.	s
Some adults may not enjoy this film but kids will, perhaps even teenagers.	s
It's the size of a grain of rice.	s
And who is "To Spring"'s director?	s
I couldn't hold back the tears when I watched this beautiful documentary.	s
It is was produced by Roger Corman, who at this point had already produced a few WIPs.	s
A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie.	s
Not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations.	s
How can a little girl have a voice so big.	s
Of course, this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up.	s
Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called "Townsell."	s
Rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have kept away many film goers looking for a Pianist similar plot.	s
We strive for them as if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have anything to strive for.	s
Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters.	s
I TiVO every episode of What I Like About You.	s
His hair color may not convince but his performance does, a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn't wear a gun, the gun wears him.	s
Subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my French is "presque rien."	s
Yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and I found myself engrossed throughout.Due in no small way to the crisp, thoughtful and interesting dialogue.The film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical "legends" who formerly composed together then seperated.The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial "split".	s
The climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene.	s
It is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud, but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls into the lavvies while forcing her to wear an inpromptu mask made from a poster of Ali Daei, I couldn't stop waking the others in the house with my snorts, especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather's calls for assistance...	s
I can't stand people that get on IMDb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one.	s
Ray did a great job directing this flick, Smith and Travis were good, I'd give this B western on a scale of one to ten(ten being the best) a seven.	s
The best character is Zechs, who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series.	s
So what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from Star Trek II?	s
The chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments.	s
A perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind.	s
For those of you who missed it (and shame!)	s
The film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man, Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), who applies to the Digicorp group to work as an undercover operative.	s
I gave it a 7 out of 10, merely because of the dull last half hour.	s
This is THE thriller of the year..no doubt.	s
That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day.	s
Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre.	s
And I love it.	s
The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned early on--and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children?	s
Grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life.	s
Every Walsh film I have seen never loses a beat of it's pace, he truly was a born film-maker.	s
As it stands now, it's on about the same level as the rest of the scoring.	s
Kelso wasn't in it for the most part either, which didn't help.	s
He imitates the original Shan Te, tries all manner of tricks to get into Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses.	s
Once there he sees visions of a woman in black, is she real or imaginary,he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes, these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified.	s
And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous.	s
So stay out.	s
Actually, it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.	s
Bravo!	s
A world class BS'er and "responsible" mother figure type I identified immediately with Jeanie (I was also the one with a car) although I had a little bit of Madge's insecurities floating around in there too.	s
As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face.	s
When he finds out she's engaged, he nearly goes crazy.	s
Producer/director Brian Yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like Re-Animator and From Beyond.	s
While The Grinch does not like christmas.	s
Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichés and the actors' own typecasting (Brosnan's James Bond in particular), and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent Hollywood.	s
Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native-born pronunciation, are outstanding.	s
Fessenden successfully continues George Romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out.	s
The tale, about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate, but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch.	s
Wait, did I mentioned this is an ORIENTAL fantasy moive?	s
It's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie.	s
I am not a Buddhist.	s
It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it's just magical.	s
On a personal level, I am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect.	s
whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not, BB&C is a visual feast.	s
In today's marketplace, it's a rarity: a family movie that respects its viewers' intelligence.	s
Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and simple, but delivers laughs a-plenty.	s
This is a movie you can watch over and over again.	s
You can't tell me what to do!	s
I hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time.	s
The boys then fool around in the studio, put on Miss Van Doren's record and Curly gets dressed in women's clothes and pretends he's singing.	s
He IS the middle aged Inspector Antoine Gallien who wants to find out the truth, who is aware that his questions are "missiles" towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate.	s
Watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where Lt. Corrigan refers to the dead woman as 'Tatooed Tilly' BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing huh?).	s
Gold shipments must get thru to Mexico City.	s
The story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: "Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life.	s
The movie was so moving to me that I was very touched.	s
The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway.	s
I hope the director will go on stepping across the border, as though i felt the choices Vincenzo Natali made, were not always subtle (some of the scenes were unhappily kind of "tarte-à-la-crème", like a childish slapstick), speaking about script and cinematography The color of "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprisingly, than the former films of Natali.	s
The last episode made me feel a lot better though (SPOILER)having Sabrina end up with Harvey on her wedding day to dullard Aaron was great!	s
Still, I enjoyed this one, it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment, a good story and decent doses of Zatoichi's trademark ingenious and quirky cool.	s
Coming from the same director who'd done "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised it's a good film.	s
People also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion, for instance in a junkyard cruncher.	s
Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality, working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at Warners, a studio that was one of the "big five" majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres.	s
But then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth.	s
I mean there's Tom Cruise but to me he's better at being Tom Cruise than becoming a character.	s
Dialog and acting are great.	s
Enter young wonder kid (a solid Reeve) who's just written such a play.	s
It's a little lacking in some areas but nothing I can really lay my finger on.	s
Well, not totally like that lol.	s
He didn't want to get involved, but he remembered pledging to bring Triple H to the nWo.	s
Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.)	s
Even if it had something of a theater-play (almost everything happens in the cell) it never got boring and it was acted very well.	s
Don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records.	s
I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me.	s
Viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story-lines together are right.	s
The much talked about dog chase sequence isn't bad but is not redeeming either.	s
It falls somewhere in the middle.	s
After watching it, I realized how sad Lucille Ball's life really was.	s
When he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well.	s
I'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film.	s
Mr. Sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents.	s
This movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come.	s
This movie appealed to me in the same way that Sideways did, although the characters couldn't be more dissimilar.	s
Summing up: A true American classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life.	s
Cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now.	s
This movie brought back some vivid memories.	s
Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons.	s
A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck.	s
But then again the film gives us another theory on Prince and his music, as the film tells us that Prince's biggest song of the film is written by Wendy, lisa and Princes wife beating musical father!	s
It probably doesn't play as well in your living room.	s
Never before has a movie made L.A. look so good.	s
Example of how a World War 2 documentary should be made,using first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful conflict,and archived footage gathered from around the time .I caught this on a re-run on the History channel about a year and a half back,with no knowledge really of the Second World War at the time,but it enveloped me,and now I consider myself a World War 2 buff,watching and reading any and all that I can find about it,but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary,definitely worth buying the boxed set of.............	s
The cinematography is also great - a love letter to the Welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of London streets and typical pub life in the Welsh country towns.	s
So how raunchy is it?	s
She just should do more such roles.	s
You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.	s
At least now I understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for Zane, who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves IMHO - they were winners from a reality show.	s
I love the relationship between the two leads, which is the crucial thing about this story, and the humour of their encounters.	s
Watching this again as an adult I see now what GREAT ACTORS the Star Trek Universe provides.	s
The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children's fear - the teacher (thinking only of her own safety) runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman!!!!	s
All the other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much there are children like him.	s
This was raunchy and crude, but thank god!	s
The director, John Boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters.	s
This movie is Jackie's best.	s
okay, but just plain dumb.	s
That's just the simple truth... See it!	s
It's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch!	s
You have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day, the bus driver who's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control.	s
Finally, does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war?	s
I'd never even heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's performance.	s
If you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely.	s
Still, despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at.	s
Jim Kouf, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves.	s
I thought these actors did a good job of it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily.	s
Great performances all around by the leads with Pitt in particular being exceptional.	s
They've got everything in here, from pointing the bone to the dream time, a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real.	s
The end is far from being anti-climatic,it is the telling of who Gunga Din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed.Ballantine knows his heart and asks the Colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes MaChesney quite pleased with the Colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time.The Colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense.MaChesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medal.This is a very sober point and then he comes to Din.Now here is a man who has no actually status so I am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored dead.The poem is read as though it was just penned by Kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the men.Gunga Din Bravo!	s
And then the tricky cuts!	s
I don't know how long I had been waiting to see it, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love.	s
What I mean is that though Pierce Brosnan's filthy, womanizing, boozing hit man is a detached comical character, he's grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by Brosnan, who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh James Bondless air.	s
It's awesome.	s
The lesson of World War One (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to World War Two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since: Korea, Vietnam, nor Iraq.	s
rest assured, there are TONS of things that are alluded to throughout the movie.	s
A good array of characters and points of view; and Singleton doesn't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic, and he does a good job of interspersing the Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides.	s
I would have been happier had there been more deep diving since I am a diver myself, but it was supposed to portray the life of Carl Brashear and that's what it was about.	s
This is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the Academy Award, but lost.	s
A true Hollywood epic, it has all the things a great Hollywood film has: Birth, death, happiness, sadness, exhilaration, despair, and so on.	s
The effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture.	s
I began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way.	s
It's a really good movie for families.	s
It's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you'd ever see.	s
On the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God He did!	s
I do admire Joan Plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here.	s
The screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters, but you can't catch all the development because of the twists.	s
Rumor has it Show People was loosely based on the life of Gloria Swanson, who began in Sennett comedies and rose to grand drama (And don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone!)	s
The director, Christophe Honore, has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen.	s
It is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told.	s
If this was done in my name as an American for my supposed safety, I don't want it.	s
Melissa Joan Hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions.	s
In my opinion, the Norris Brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production!	s
I'm too old to know (or care) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is.	s
Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.	s
A self-appointed matchmaker, Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another.	s
The ending of the movie, without ruining it, comes a bit disappointing; it's something I wasn't waiting for.	s
But I was wrong.	s
This is a great movie.	s
This is a perfect series for family viewing.	s
The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are specially interesting.	s
Photography, music and direction are a little bit dull, but professional enough.	s
The Oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly, and ignoring the "auteurs" who would be deified in decades to come.	s
bye.	s
That is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that I dis-like them), but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it.	s
Best lines in the movie: Detective Manners: *sniffs coke* Detective Sloane: What the *beep* are you doing, Manners?	s
If this one does not get picked up in the USA, it would truly be most unfortunate.	s
I sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film.	s
The movie wouldn't be so interesting were there only the woman.	s
The problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story, or the film would have been "too surreal" for mainstream audiences, owing to its lurid animation format.	s
While I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we obtain peace?)	s
Indeed.	s
The attempt at the hand of an older woman in the Tate's household of a sexual molestation, gives Antwone a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life, as he has been scarred by the shame he carries with him.	s
This was not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.	s
The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be.	s
And Mark Price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar Michael J Fox.	s
He is no Lex Luthor.	s
I like the movie overall so i give it a...	s
His halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie.	s
Believe it or not, MURDER AT THE VANITIES is a musical comedy thriller, if you know what I mean -a murder mystery incorporated in a musical show.	s
This is of course, the story of one of America's great military figures, and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory.	s
Great idea...if you ignore the screwup factor.	s
Like Japanese plays, the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene.	s
I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work.	s
With the mixed reviews this got I wasn't expecting too much, and was pleasantly surprised.	s
After Dan Blocker died, the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled.	s
So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powder-blue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door.	s
Here's Louella O. Parsons in the "Los Angeles Examiner" on May 17, 1934 Earl Carroll's hand-picked beauties' pirouette about on the Grauman United Artists screen in a fig leaf and not much else.	s
Yes indeed, priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin.	s
The lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving.	s
They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it.	s
The human toll on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield.	s
They were broadcast elsewhere.	s
Well to get to the nitty-gritty of this film: This film is a live-action/animated film, which begins in live-action with a fellow named Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush to help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police.	s
were very realistic.The initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not.I want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film.	s
The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of Head Trader Wendy Foley's (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms, interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and, to most people, seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast.	s
The setting is backwoods Georgia, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers.	s
The third follows their European tour.	s
How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones?	s
I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.	s
Die Hard 2, The long kiss good bye, etc.	s
The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp, and form new memories in their latest stay.	s
There are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look.	s
With of course some action, some sex, but this is no pornography, too many feelings.	s
I even consider a few of the OZ suit designs to be on par with some of the classic Zeon suits.	s
He turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation ($49.95, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (Boyle).	s
They are prone to suicide -- or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide.	s
Bravo.	s
My personal favorite of the Martino films I've seen so far is still the insanely brilliant "Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key" of 1972, followed by "Torso" (1973) and "The Strange Vice Of Mrs Wardh" (1971), all of which I personally like even more than this one.	s
Pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits.	s
We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying "Bippity- boppity-boo!," and of course, trying to head home by midnight!	s
If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.	s
Watch Maureen Stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard-working mom, with surprise gags that you'll never see coming.	s
In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film.	s
I will not go into the plot any further, except to say that Leslie eventually realizes what a mistake Logan has made, and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.	s
I love this old movie!	s
You wouldn't be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom.	s
Clearly, the costuming decision was æsthetic: these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than Regency fashions, and they work in the idealised world of the film.	s
For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to.	s
Michael Douglas has been and done that before.	s
My problem is theres too many characters!	s
And the conflict between the two sisters and Gig is never solved.	s
He was brilliant then and now.	s
His fee is exorbitant, but they agree.	s
They even stole from "The Partirdge Family."	s
His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father.	s
The heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal.	s
WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me :) Hail from Romania	s
After the glories of The Snare, it was unlikely that a further outing for Hanzo would be able to do any better, and this doesn't breach that expectation, but it is a fine film and sits neatly in between the fun but messy first chapter and the terrific second in terms of quality and general entertainment.	s
There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism.	s
The lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force.	s
Freeze or Phantasm were).	s
Not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can in fact last.	s
fox, film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace.	s
Even his singing was a delight.	s
N(n***as) W(with) H(hats) takes itself seriously enough to reel you in, then you're hooked.	s
The Swedish gal (Helga) was what made this movie so great.	s
At the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being, and are left with the 'things are going to be OK' type of a feeling.	s
It's not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt, is still a pleasant feeling.	s
It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism.	s
If you like splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera than this is the film for you.	s
I know it's crude, and I know that it isn't at all PC, but it's so funny.	s
In all my 60 years of age, I have learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification (whether we want it or not) implicit with an specific character.	s
The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'believable' way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character's naiveness doesn't quite work for a grown-up woman.	s
I wasn't thrilled with Ewan McGregor even though I like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all.	s
As for me it's unacceptable.	s
This time this certainty is raised to fact, no question.	s
This is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic.	s
In the many years it took to return tho, the Vulcan Tuvoks' mind has been destroyed.	s
Also I love the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro.	s
After Chicago, I was beginning to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then along came The Flock.	s
Amazing acting, music.	s
Two of the best actors of their time-Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director Herbert Ross, and all of that makes this stage adaption come true.	s
Getting yourself in the top of the Hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first jab at the lead role was David Schwimmer's comedy Run Fatboy Run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike.	s
It helps the play come to life on screen, and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching, as we did while studying it, to follow and analyze the text.	s
While the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward, Miike still throws in A LOT of surreal and Bunuel-esquire moments.	s
People all know it, they hum the theme song, they complain of living with a sloppy "Oscar" or a fastidious "Felix"...but they're under-selling the film without knowing it.	s
Of course later directors have been flashier, but it's difficult to say that they've been better.	s
If you haven't seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria.	s
The characters are fully realized, and the portrayals are fantastic.	s
She just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film.	s
It seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft.	s
Upon revisiting it, I think history supports my initial reaction!	s
I think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie.	s
I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it.	s
i can't wait till the week goes by to see the next showing.	s
She will learn the house's secrets.	s
The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time.	s
He is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys, but seems harmless.	s
Of particular note is John Hurt as Aragorn who just oozes the essence of Strider.	s
Despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed Union men, he remains loyal to the cause.	s
In the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, get just what they deserve for Christmas!	s
This did not detract from my understanding of the film, but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater.	s
A special personal thank you from my soul to all of you, that you brought back some precious memories from the second decade of my life.	s
Those who love it (ie.	s
Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys.	s
That's not what this is about.	s
Holy crap this is so hysterical!	s
Best movie I have seen in a long time.	s
I was lucky enough to attend a screening in Stockholm for this elegantly expressed, enjoyable, and thought-provoking film.	s
However, the Russian sci-fi action flick, The Sword Bearer, is far from the standard stock.	s
Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.	s
Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun.	s
We, as movie goers, see them watching this play, and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes.	s
I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend that everyone catches it.	s
I think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it.	s
I remember watching "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother, and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes.	s
He has no historical frame of reference to speak of (eight years old), so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid might as well be Oz under Ozma.	s
I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day.	s
Diana Guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion.	s
Even if the end is tragic, "The Man in the Moon" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with Court.	s
I agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where Theo says he will be a father moving, and I'd go a little further to say I actually vocalised my thoughts at Ryan when he cruelly says to Theo 'What makes you think you can be a father' and Theo says simply 'You.'	s
Steve Lundquist returns as Igor, a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true King of France.	s
I saw the movie by myself.)	s
The solid supporting cast includes Lena Olin (Dr. Annabel Leek), Eddie Izzard (Tony P.), Tom Waits (Doc Heller), Claire Forlani (Monica), Louise Lasser (The Blue Raja's mother), Jenifer Lewis (Lucille) and Pras (Tony C.).	s
and possibly closest to the Dickens story line.	s
You just can't go wrong with Busby Berkley films and this certainly must be his best.	s
Nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitancy, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc; she then begins walking through those emotions in her personal life.	s
Rob Roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect.	s
And a slice.	s
It was remade in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you only want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend the latter one, with Hopkins' up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at.	s
I don't see this movie on television much anymore, but when I do I never fail to watch it.	s
Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.	s
What they don't know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever HE says.	s
Featuring dreadful acting by the entire cast (Daphne Zuniga makes her ignominious and inauspicious film debut here as Debbie, a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car!	s
But for me, it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time.	s
It's also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (better remembered for the Airplane and Naked Gun movies) as a young, but still mature man.	s
Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man.	s
Supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face!	s
Knowing Pitt, as we all do, as one of the most enduring heart-throbs Hollywood has ever had, it is refreshing to see him play such a vile, unattractive character.	s
The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed.	s

The soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way, David marries his beloved Bathsheba in full regal splendor... God punishes the couple when Bathsheba's child dies soon after birth...	s
But only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are, in not being with a woman for years, as horny as a rabbit during mating season!	s
The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games.	s
I haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, I'd be in heaven.	s
One of the best parts of the film is the set... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film, the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at, still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this.	s
BASIC PLOT: An expedition is sent out from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a great mainsequence star in constellation Aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since.	s
And now I really hate the fact that it's going to be cancelled.	s
This is your typical Lynch short.	s
I would never have thought I would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound.	s
It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren't part of the concert, but fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls.	s
Sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy-look.	s
Canto 3: How King Attila Besieged Rome and How Kriemhild Summoned her Brothers: When Kriemhild delivers a baby boy, Attila returns to his realm and asks Kriemhild what she would like most to please her.	s
The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton.	s
I liked this TV show because it was it's own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well.	s
It is an all around good film.	s
All of the main characters are interesting (except for the head bad guy, who is flat as a billiard table) and most are fairly well acted.	s
Walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully, as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant, great final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn.	s
Not to say its a childish movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all.	s
In fact, here it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater, including 300.	s
There was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomached.	s
You can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers.	s
You like complex narrations?	s
And, like all movies, there are some negatives, too.	s
When I was a kid in the 1960s, Che's image was everywhere; on bedroom wall posters, on T shirts, on magazine covers.	s
It is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old.	s
Of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments.	s
The plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and MOST OF ALL ....	s
When Mr. Beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend, he chases her around angrily, but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie.	s
The Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works.	s
I couldn't relate to everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing.	s
So if you haven't seen this movie, you really should.	s
The funniest character is the father of Brak .	s
Kubrick's miss-en-scene is, as usually, terrific.	s
Because there is no real story here.	s
That's fine by me.	s
I loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a Hollywood film tends to include.	s

The gang repeatedly gets into trouble (most of it on purpose).	s
Without the commercials, which by design kill the continuity of any good film, This would have been a real edge-of-the-seat nail-biter.	s

Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next.	s
This sitcom had a feel of 'Citizen Smith' about it.	s
Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece.	s
And weather it is due to the strong script, or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own, SUGAR COOKIES is a very intelligent, highly suspenseful and well-crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives.	s
Cooper is as tough as either of them, though he gets a chance to turn on the tears.	s
Here, Ryunosuke Kamiki plays Tadashi, the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world, but will become the hero in a world going into darkness.	s

At a time during the Cold War when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the Western orbit, it seems British and American officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option.	s
However this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience.	s
I've really never enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I'll tell you what, she really changed my mind with this one.	s
This film is at least as good as the likes of 'Silence of the Lambs'.	s

Fellini and Visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from Neorealism.	s
The DVD is So great, It has an extra 30 min that the original did not have.	s
Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package.	s
With a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves, Che Part Two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.	s
I have commented on that film in a review the other night, and I pointed out that Wayne and James Edward Grant (the screenwriter) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle.	s
How many are there?	s
Well what do you think?	s
This close contact, in my estimation, is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals.	s

The locations gave us a view of London that is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes .The Catherine character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed.	s
That's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition.	s
For that reason he must not remain forgotten.	s
She doesn't fit into the storyline at all.	s
It is hard to determine where things are placed in the Mis-En-Scene.	s
If this was being ranked as a professional production, I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets.	s
Somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other.	s
I will rate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the screenplay.	s
Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls.	s
I really can't see why.	s
Don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews.	s
He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means.	s
The plot is a reworking of his recent London-based thriller Match Point, right down to the upper-class sins and the "American Tragedy"/Place in the Sun boating "accident."	s
Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge-films, but even though I haven't seen them, I believe it isn't right to compare any film, actually.	s
I saw the movie recently during the Boston Film festival.	s
Portraying a bunch of high school students using the Ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (Mary Woronov, of "Eating Raoul" fame), the whole movie is a mile a minute.	s
However, this was a movie as a child that I was a fervent admirer of; keeping in mind now that it was made for children, I rate it on a relative basis.	s
Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in reference to Silverman, or who claims that she only aims to "shock"... is way off the mark... She's exactly the opposite; just Google her and you'll quickly see that she's a huge proponent of civil rights, etc.	s
It would be impossible to keep a straight face watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public!	s
The Act I 'set-up' draws you in right away.	s
the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets).	s
Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax.	s
Moving.	s
Tessari and scenarists Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of "A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die," and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire.	s
As such, it was successful although I liked it too.	s
But all the actors are equally brilliant.	s
Carole and Arthur are great together.	s
It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes, five feet deep and five feet wide.	s
His desires show him totally different direction... Do viewers remain indifferent at Gino-Giovanna's first meeting?	s
Did I "understand" every scene?	s
I saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class.	s
However I don't want to suggest that the film is bad in any way.	s

Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end.	s
If you prefer action, or horror, or romance, then you'll wonder what's happening.	s
Especially if you want a more factual account of Ned Kelly's life.	s
It does drag at points, and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix's death, but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil.	s
So on that note, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie buffs who love old-fashioned musical comedies.	s
Sure the CGI effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect.	s
Pushing Daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.	s
The need to have, and the need to be.	s
George C. Scott plays a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing.	s

This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the end of World War 2.	s
I speak and understand English, but not all my relatives do, including my parents, whom introduced me into these great stories...	s
Then it goes from a good film to a great one.	s
Race was a non-factor to the performance of the roles in this movie.	s
I figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students.	s
In 1957 I saw "The First Man Into Space" in a movie theater with my Dad.	s
At least the leads were not played by cross-dressing Caucasians, unlike other efforts such as 'Blood Alley' (yes, I know they were Chinese) 'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness' or even 'The King And I'.	s

This movie SCREAMS "80s."	s
The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth.	s
Often known for its "SQUEAL!"	s
The hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that George has ended their chase.	s
The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd, whom I like from previous movies.	s
Not only is the location scenic, but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.	s

Check this one out!!!	s

If you have to rent the disc (or check it out from your local library), do it.	s

So what was it?	s
Closing Day.	s
Who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong?	s
John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece.	s
This is a must see film, and Jon Anderson's "Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life" is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40's, 50's & 60's that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbors, and the effects it fostered.	s
Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience.	s
Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.	s
The relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film.	s
It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s, but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons.	s
This sounds a bit off topic, but making a live action Justice League show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode.	s
If I were on his shoes, I could have jumped a ten-story high building.	s
This is actually one of my favorites of his movies - second, after "Rosemary's Baby", of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim.	s
It's fun.	s
Other than that it was great.	s
This animation TV series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works.	s
No more "Batman & Robin" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc.	s
And the Direction?	s
No laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence (and if that floats your boat, so be it) but sharp solid direction, excellent dialogue, and great performances.	s
There's so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin.	s
I also love Dario Argento's work from that period.	s
I could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring), but not a single of them is plain bad.	s
Besides he also gave voice to the young generations, and to the remarkable part of them, who really need PEACE and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people, both in Israel both in Palestine.	s
Okay, so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking, but it's a small flaw, more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film, and the eerie backdrop of the silent, snowy countryside.	s
Or laughed aloud.	s
The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting.	s
But also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here; you don't get to see historical things like this every day.	s
This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to "Match Point" and yet it all works.	s
I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen.	s
At that moment, however, Mr. Beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle.	s
There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat.	s
It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.	s
Now I like it very much, because my favourite characters are there as I portraited them.	s
I believe you can truly make it.	s

I had the privilege to see this movie at the Intenational Film Festival of Rotterdam.	s
When Andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his failed efforts at cooking.	s

Les Pays-Bas : huit points.	s
I think only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man.	s
I like the black cat.	s
She persuades her friend Harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer, Robert Martin, believing that Harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman Mr Elton.	s
So naturally, she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade.	s
We all know of the other acts on the bill, The Doors (their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more.	s
Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered.	s
This is essentially a courtroom drama with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront.	s
Personally, I felt that The Argentine (ie part one) was much easier to watch and more 'entertaining' in the strictly movie sense, because it is upbeat.	s
Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries.	s
The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and all of the visuals are great, with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones.	s
In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers, musicians, and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens, flats, and mirrors arranged by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, another of the Spanish filmmaker's important collaborators.	s
This woman was lonely since the death of her husband.	s
the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (I think the first class had attended five years, the other for four).	s
Then, she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street, visits her sister in a nursing home, then goes a'hunting in San Paolo, CA "up the coast" where the rape event took place years ago.	s
Fox's new DVD is a good transfer, including an incredibly hokey 'candid' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene.	s

Buy this movie and treasure it.	s
Not so this gloriously bent, batty and berserk over-the-top Italian-made shot-in-Canada kitsch gut-buster: It's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over-baked "what the hell's going on?"	s
hmmm?	s
The interest of Saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works.	s
While Drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis is having some difficulty buying the gas, and Bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is.	s
When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a Church basement, and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says - "Michael, there are only murderers in this room,.., and there's only one guarantee, none of us will see Heaven."	s
Though guilty of some bad acting, this is earnest enough and unpretentious, making it hard for me to dislike.	s
Because it's only the first episode, only the introduction, and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns.	s
Ironic, given the tragic events that were taking place in the U.S. during the festival.	s
But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave.	s
Meanwhile Ann's daughters, the insecure and unstable Nina Mars (Toni Collette) and the happy wife and mother Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson), are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved.	s
Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs.	s
Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization.	s
The major problem with CITY HALL, and it is a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of a lack of momentum.	s
Further, I've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film.	s
As is the penchant of French filmmakers , many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places, giving a cinema verite feel to the story , yet L'Emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a Swiss mountain retreat ).	s
The film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side.	s
And Gilbert Markham was amazingly "on it" from the very start of the movie.	s
Other must have from Eddie is "Coming to America" and "48 hours".	s
Caligari."	s
Much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling, I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses.	s
Then, when all the males arrived at camp, it turned out there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but wasn't.	s
Director Ruggero Deodato has made some actually very good movies, like House on the Edge of the Park, and also his Atlantis Interceptors and Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man are enjoyable action movies.	s
It would be hard to make a film like this, always on the road.	s
Produced in 1944, the Japanese defeated, the battle scenes a little déjà vu, Tom Drake's melancholy attraction for radiant young Jan Clayton has solid chemistry, plays real and validates Drake's career at Metro.	s
Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.	s
So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel.	s
In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital.	s
Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends.	s
the girls are allowing this, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron.	s
However, this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it.	s
This film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw, but still is able to convey the mastery of Depardieu.	s
Sort of like "The Game of Death", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.	s
The first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like April Love is to remember the era from which it came, in this case the late fifties.	s
And for that, it is great fun to watch.	s
And it succeeds wonderfully.	s
The filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic, fast-changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it.	s
Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan, a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself.	s
Wasn't sure what to expect from this film.	s
Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it.	s
York again also is brilliant in this kind of play.	s
The pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one.	s
Barbara Stanwyck as a real tough cookie, a waitress to the working classes (and prostitute at the hands of her father) who escapes to New York City and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job, moving on to Mortgage and Escrow, and later as assistant secretary to the second in command at the bank.	s
And the doctor is an escapee from the Phantom Zone.	s
She gives a fine performance, proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool.	s
Given the overall results, I expect she dealt as honestly with the topic as she was allowed to.	s
Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins.	s
Right?	s
But if you've truly looked carefully at Bettie's poses, she always looked happy.	s
Paul Muni shows that he can act as well.	s
The acting was good, and the bonds between each member of this rural French family seemed so strong and so natural.	s
Don't believe me?	s
Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.	s
Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact.	s
Women, it's awful what Lily does in order to get what she wants, but it works.	s

The scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic, focusing on the desperation within individuals.	s
There is a fact about this movie (definitely true).	s
The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in.	s
There are many plots and turns.	s
The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself.	s
The title has many meanings - the boxing ring, where differences and grievances are fought out, a wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble, a ring-like bracelet that Bill gives Mabel as a love token.	s
Touching and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful.	s
The most controversial decision they're willing to tackle today is how much eye make-up to put on Katie Couric.	s
While the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who haven't studied horses might not understand.	s
I tried to buy it at Blockbuster but they don't know it by the original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find if I have the name they gave to it in Mexico, do someone knows it?, because I can't remember!	s

I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn't enjoy the film.	s
For the little acting Ilene Woods did in her lifetime, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very appealing; very believable.	s
It is, quite simply, brilliant.	s
Political correctness flies out the window in every episode.	s
The Lord Of The Rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based.	s
I give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten	s
The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks, although the two films are nothing alike content wise.	s
The British Film Institute's print, which has rhyming intertitles, tells the story of two sibling beetles, each secretly married, who hide this information from one another in order to inherit their late father's fortune.	s
He was believable and real.	s
But it is another Bogart picture, "Beat the Devil" which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is the McGuffin.	s
cheers, Boom	s
My Take: A goofy, yet imaginative mess.	s
I'm disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb.	s
How they buy Acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people, but the point here - I mean "hare" - is to have fun.	s
Overall 8-9/10	s
Guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and Joan Greenwood is delectable as Daphne (just the way she enunciates the word "Daddy", makes the entire movie worth seeing).	s
In that sense Sooraj R. Barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie.	s
One of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted; more and more funny.	s
The film is averagely acted by Ledger, Bloom, and the normally great Watts and Rush.	s

IF they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event.	s
Such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer.	s
It begs the question why did Disney make such changes?	s
But it was still painful to watch at times.	s
I have already watched it four more times, and cannot seem to get tired of it.	s
I'm an adult, and I really appreciate that it is for adults.	s
The plot is classic Miyazaki.	s
As he proceeds to freak out his victim (Jennifer Garner lookalike Rachel McAdams, who I found pretty annoying by the way), you can't help but sympathize with the guy...	s
I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad guy.	s
I get some good laughs here and there, but much of it seems like filler while she, and the writers, struggle to foment some original material.	s
As I am allergic to mosquitos, Florida is no paradise to me, I itch all over thinking about Florida.	s
That doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining.	s
I love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end.	s
The reason why "Slaughter High" stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top.	s
It was painful to watch, but everyone redeemed himself in the end, and the acting was phenomenal!	s

We are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces.	s
Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the "Empire Strikes Back" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.	s
The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive.	s
This will become a cult British comedy.	s
I watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime I often thought about it, proof that Fox and his pal have a knack to strike home.	s
The problem of the show is kind of that it doesn't know what it wants to be really.	s
Benjamin hits on a brain storm, reunite the guys and do it on a national television special.	s
Like a lot of those 1950s pictures, "Written on the Wind" was shot entirely in a studio lot.	s
The massacre shot in CCTV fashion is at times shocking, and whilst it was certainly the perfect choice to depict the massacre if we were going to it is not void of flaws.	s
In another a separated husband and wife (Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara) meet in the Latin Quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in Père-Lachaise (Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell) approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed Oscar Wilde intervenes.	s
Charlize Theron was the one in "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol was in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity", and "Rounders".	s
Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.	s
Her edges are really hard.	s
The closing songs BABY I'M A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show how much energy and sheer talent Prince was brimming with in his mid-20s (he's overflowing!	s

It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together.	s
It's a long way from Joe Losey's 1966 travesty, and it takes our Modesty quite seriously.	s
Her pastor agrees with what she wants to do.	s
I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film.	s
She is majestic singing "With One More Look At You.	s
Tyne Daly was hilarious as Albert's obnoxious mother and George Wendt was superb as the annoyed Mr. McAfee (however I LOVED Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!).	s
It's got everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following one's family "traditions" to those of seeking ones own way through life.	s
Rachel McAdams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel.	s
Incredibly, the number of depictions of violence on-screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination, all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence.	s
He is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence.	s
That dark side that could lead him right at the end of the sidewalk, into the gutter ?	s
Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area.	s
One has found salvation with the Salvation Army.	s
You'll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you're thrown into the story of another.	s
The results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent.	s
See for instance Shirley Jones in "Elmer Gantry.	s
In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "Ghost Train" -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying.	s
Great Slasher Film.	s
Well done to all concerned.	s
The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.	s
This was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all.	s
The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions.	s
But is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share?	s
This is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well  Karen Kopins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with Jake (unfortunately it never convinces).	s
The ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition, and the human capacity for violence and undoing'.	s
This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability.	s
Which is probably why my "laugh center" was so overwhelmed; it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything.	s
He gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy.	s
Oscar theories aside, here's my bottom line review: If you like Matthau's comic acting, then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother-inspired gestures, fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides.	s
He had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see.	s
They are always right when it comes to real horror fan's tastes.	s
Yet the suburban drama presented by Forbidden Planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci-fi genre.	s
This is the sporty, little Italian number of zombie flicks.	s
I'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie.	s
The SFX are very good for a movie of its age, and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors, even down to body type, a rarity in movies of this vintage.	s
Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history!!	s
The third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear.	s
All in all, it's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories.	s
There is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.	s
We watched it last night for the first time.	s
When her father consoles her with "I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow", she replies "Oh I can see enough monkeys around here"!!!	s
Many super stars wanted to make films with the actor Stan Evans, who has a "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable}acting style.	s
There is not a boring moment in the whole picture.	s
Nearly everyone involved here has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless.	s
Eddie Izzard is a genius, he picks in Brits, Americans and everyone in between.	s
Even with the new "Left Behind" series coming out, telling the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is still the same--"A Thief in the Night" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.	s
Highly recommended for all "Alan Ford" fans!	s
Memo to producers: Season Three (if we're blessed enough to have it happen) should be Rockstar: House Band.	s
Taken from a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, it leaves plenty of other 'original' fantasy works in its wake.	s
This is a movie you can watch over again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on.	s
Not being a fan of first person shooters I was very hesitant to play this game.	s
Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous!	s
My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the ending.	s
There are no Beatle songs in the movie, or even any mention of them.	s
In other words it was " Le Pacte des Loups " or " Dobermann " ( I like Dobermann, mind you )...	s
But "uplifting" is perhaps as apropos as any of those.	s
I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and I could easily sit through it five more times.	s
A movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the Luzhin Defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.	s
This if played right could be the next Cold feet.	s
My college professor says that Othello may be Shakespeare's finest drama.	s
The scarier children's animations are always my favorite ones.	s
Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism.	s
Thanks for me and i am sorry for my English, thats not so good.	s
I've seen this film at least 4 times since '84 and it's still great every time I see it.	s
This ties into what Abigail always felt about him in Edmund not being in love with Phyllis and also a suspect in her, in Abigail's mind, murder.	s
This film is a delightful, light hearted look at both sides of where the "club kid" rave scene blends with the New York art, music and performance art worlds (with a cameo by the omnipresent Miss Bunny).	s
Though, there have been a few about the subject, but none of them like this documentary.	s
This is one of my favorite pictures.	s
To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the film's central message, but I admire its audacity nonetheless.	s
Chris, barely aware that he and Kitty were ever married, is unaware of his child and the child's death.	s
The script, being a tad weak, was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire.	s
And the only other movie I've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass.	s
Oh, by the way, he accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto."	s
Some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" starring Will Smith.	s
It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good.	s
What no one at the fight knows is that Bob is the champ, so he's able to beat Jack--though it takes him some work.	s
Such western legends as Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp (terrifically played by Will Geer) make brief appearances, adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature.	s
Seachd doesn't seem to be about that at all.	s
Sean has not endeared himself to his superior because he discovered the involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business.	s
While we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package is woefully short of extras.	s
You get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition, and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service.	s
She never lets Gable get all the good lines!	s
Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.	s
Not a film of high voltage excitement, but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser.	s
It also has a very catchy score just for good measure by Bruno Nicolai that will stay in your head for a while....all in all a first rate Giallo.	s
There's the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to Akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (I loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-Yokai).	s
Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy/western TV series, "Maverick."	s
The first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH, I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN, the Kelly/Sinatra collaboration from 1949.	s
Containing very graphic depictions death-scenes; A parachute that doesn't open *smack* guys body on the floor.	s
Yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce, despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today's audiences wouldn't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime.	s
Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch-particularly when he interacted with Cindy.	s
Nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect, like any other relationship.	s
What was once a very white, clean-cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use, violence, and perversion.	s
A delightful gentle comedic gem, until the last five minutes, which degenerate into run of the mill British TV farce.	s
Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners, kicks that ass, and as always is a big physical presence!, and was tons of fun to watch!	s
Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting.	s
There is real skill here.	s
Bond is a half-formed idea, a product of all that has gone before; while Julian is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws.	s
What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into.	s
None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments, aside from the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all she's worth and steals the episode with ease.	s
This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion.	s
Will she escape?	s
Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her!	s
Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty.	s
Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions.	s
The affair, once disclosed, allows the peeling open of the mother-daughter relationship which, from Paula's viewpoint, left something to be desired.	s
Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at.	s
Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him.	s
Eventually they do become spoken, but is there a chance to change anything about the situation.	s
John Goodman, Gary Cole (as Strauss' brother) and a few other co-workers are also affected.	s
You know what they say about the 70's..if you can remember them you weren't there.	s
For Lynch fan's.	s
Mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story, and bring about laughter, because some of the incidents, we would have experienced it ourselves, and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood.	s
Pegg has had a few hits in the past few years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, movie on to "Hot Fuzz 2007", early 2008 he came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now comes this, "How To Lose Friends And Alienate People" which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy's of the year.	s
Thanks!	s
Since that happened, I've always wondered what the show would have been like.	s
And the second point, making a blockbuster movie about it.	s
Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch.	s
This film is no exception.	s
This was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet-phobia, under-uniform cross-dressing, in-van homosexuality, lost truncheons, casual drunken bestiality (regretted), siren aversion syndrome (SAS), groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many, many more issues that still trouble, disturb, haunt and excite officers to this day.	s
That's all it is.	s
I'm addicted to Strange Fruit.	s
God I love that !	s
Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of Hollywood.	s
This may give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie".	s
The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting by Poelvoorde.	s
After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable.	s
One scene that really got to me was when Madge(Marilyn Kagan), is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party, and the film has many surprising moments as well!, plus the dialog is especially excellent.	s
What Kilmer does so effortlessly is exhude the low-life of the celebrity, the do anything to anyone craving that overwhelms anyone who had it and then lost it.	s
The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.	s
I can't say I LOVED this movie, but then again I'm not its target audience!	s
If it was because starting in the Mediterranean, they could have gotten closer starting in modern day Lebanon.	s
Still, the only true problem with this film is that it wasn't distributed outside Japan sooner.	s
It is definitely worth seeing!	s
It also has been the only X rated film ever to win an Academy Award as Best Picture.	s
But those questions I mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing Guinness' invention	s
Historic for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later.	s
Through the pain we go through in life...life goes on and there can be forgiveness.	s
In fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in Moscow.	s
There is a big down side to this dub, and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips.	s
He also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire, which is one of the negatives about the show.	s
This is a very thought-provoking, enjoyable and well-made film that I would recommend to anyone with brain and heart.	s
Ripstein's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who, like the Colonel, suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose.	s
The details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes.	s
i think Alison Lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 Horus observation after meals because iv been told like 1 house is OK and also that hospitals doesn't help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why I'm still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person	s
But where-oh-WHERE are the DVD releases?	s
Or not.	s
The band's performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner.	s
The three main actors...Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas...interacted perfectly, but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream.	s
I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago.	s
The first two are casual in tone - a dance contest set to the percolating "Let Yourself Go" where they show off mercilessly to win and a physical shipboard comedy routine set to the toe-tapping "I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket".	s
These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose, leaving it up to the individual's interpretation, and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this.	s
Very entertaining, and a great cast as noted.	s
So that's the purpose of adding a story in documentary.	s
I liked her immediately then and I go out of my way to check out anything she's done.	s
This is, after all, a film about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'The Middle-Aged Victoria', nor 'The Old Victoria').	s
I wasn't expecting much, to be honest.	s
And of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded.	s
The characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them.	s
I had never even seen David Beckham before this film.	s
There was never anything quite like The Ernie Kovacks Show before -- or after.	s
The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest, Hungary, in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds-to-be along.	s
So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie.	s
It's a good one at that.	s
Well, of course not, women are overly sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or blatantly dwelt on.	s
I have to admit that I've never been a big baseball fan, but I can sometimes get into a good sports-related movie.	s
But I am extremely glad I got to see this before it vanished from sight.	s
I went to Italy over the summer, and all I could think about while I was there was how "Italians are always on scooters going 'CIAO...'" 10 out of 10.	s
Chilling indeed.	s
Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet--whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds French.	s
He wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy.	s
What can we ask more of a film?	s
IF you can handle the gore, of which there is a LOT... none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at.	s
The plot is simple, but the story is complex.	s
For those who like their westerns real, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen on screen, and who don't like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.	s
So if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery,greatness who seek inspiration.You must look this great drama.	s
The cast is likable; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed.	s
This unification of purpose, and the validation of the "troublemaking" teens, becomes official when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob.	s
Next up we saw Ken Shamrock flip out and cost himself the Intercontinental Championship as he destroyed IC Champion The Rock, but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold, resulting in the referee reversing his decision.	s
This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the old West contains what may be Jean Arthur's finest performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but devotedly doting Calamity Jane.	s
But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.	s
He is always bossing the girls around about dating, but he really wants them to be happy.	s
While they are there, the car is stolen.	s
has time or sympathy nor the other side.	s
The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms.	s
A mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead, so Holly is then left on her own.	s
I noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and I too didn't have high hopes for it.	s
And truly, what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments.	s
Great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon & Cliff DeYoung notably.	s
I've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends.	s
First is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood.	s
His directing style is clearly visible and one can say, looking at it from different angles, that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven film.	s
Later in the show, Jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins, Nicki and Alex.	s
In an era of Jerry Springer and "Lets put it out there" mentality, this film rings truer than ever.	s
Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters.	s
had me in stitches.	s
Felinni would have filmed it had he the wicked wit...	s
It was also the third of seven Karloff/Lugosi features.	s
We don't get that enough anymore.	s
She's now relying on a Las Vegas show to carry her through, but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started.	s
Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid, and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold.	s
However, they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.	s
Director Brian Yuzna, working from a suitably dark, witty and demented script by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli, and Charles Finch, exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well-manicured surface of respectable affluent rich America with deliciously malicious glee.	s
Good film with a great supporting cast.	s
Actress Kim ha nul was also charming as usual.	s
Some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot, but consider this: why would you expand on this in a movie, if you can read Andy's musings at length in his books, or attend one of his excellent lectures?	s
Their only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar) never had the need to strive for anything since he got everything tailor-made and spoon-fed in life.	s
As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal.	s
Don't get me wrong, there are moments when we see Antwone fighting, carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him.	s
It's almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes, jackhammers and the like on the dog.	s
Life in the military had been mined for action, drama, and comedy for years by this point.	s
This is, after the "Ugly Duckling", the second picture that really turned me upside down.	s
Kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing.	s
In case you're wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with the Nick Adams character from the classic TV Western "The Rebel".	s
He even takes the piss out of his American audiance at times and most of them didnt even realise it!	s
One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternate title for The Greeks Had a Word for Them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely.	s
He plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double dealings - that Cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of!	s
At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events.	s
So I've probably rambled and repeated myself, but I highly recommend "Dan in Real Life".	s
Not great, but good	s
Seven bodies, not a lot of gore, but a couple of good murders, especially the girls'deaths.	s
However, Hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers ‘A’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak…  Still, the glorious Technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and, while an older and flabbier Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self, his red-headed leading lady Maureen O’Hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady.	s
Hats off to Waters for making a consistently funny film.	s
It was written by Lajos Biro, who had been on the scene long enough to know.	s
I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie.	s
Soon they meet Simba, a Lion cub, natural predator of T and P, but they form a trio.	s
The darker side of the fabled "American Dream".	s
Put season one on video and sell it.	s
Some of our biker friends have seen the film two or three times already and can't get enough of it.	s
I would suggest those not familiar with Attenborough's work, do take time out for this.	s
The other actors in the film are also very good.	s
Why should we grant Chaplin's face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive Kim Novak's of this same privilege in two bold strokes?	s
The acting by all of these actors is very good.	s
The other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars, if they wish to enter Bollywood.	s
Or maybe just drive him mad?	s
This is Mary Kate and Ashley first took off!	s
Sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society: "When he touches you in the night, does it feel all right, or does it feel real?	s
Powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and Brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as Jannings' love.	s
It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film, having a relative who suffers from a mental illness, I can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses.	s
Can you figure out...Who Is The Mole?	s
Is the protagonist guilty or not?	s
Being raised in Texas, I understood the boredom & monotony of teenage life there.	s
Much as life itself, there are also moments of sadness too.	s
There are a number of themes that these movies share, along with others in the genre.	s
Richard Widmark makes for a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend.	s
I would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever, or rather the one he took the most chances with, and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families.	s
Regal and Taylor then grab London and suplex him face-first into the ladder!	s
Joey getting the TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard from it again after that.	s
Incredibly ARTISTIC NOBODY COULD MAKE THEM NOW I THINK.It seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry.I'M Italian AND ADMIRED BY American MUSICAL.	s
This movie will go down down in history as one of the greats, right along side of Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and On The Waterfront.	s
They like each other.	s
Teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers, so I'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on Lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie.	s
Gypo's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps, each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed.	s
They really grow on you in the film.	s
maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally?	s
But, nobody mentions the happy ending to this story.	s
The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel.	s
First he's thoroughly reprehensible then you start liking the character ("These things have a thousand uses")!	s
The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito.	s
I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it.	s
And the ever-cuddly Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith does a lovely, touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from "Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural."	s
Burt Reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job.	s
I also think it has many parallels to Clint Eastwood's classic, "High Plains Drifter".	s
Nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music, clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film.	s
How positive things can make you grow.	s
If anything though, I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth.	s
Based on a book by James Dickey (who appears in the movie as Sheriff Bullard), it's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything, when he doesn't.	s
Starring Emily Blunt in a role she can finally soar in, the film begins with Victoria's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend).	s
If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special!	s
The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide.	s
Purely personal taste, of course, as his acting in that was superb.	s
It has everything.	s
But is it really that good?	s
Well, there's an all star cast here, including Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor who all give good performances in the movie.	s
The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister.	s
A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain.	s
I love it for its originality, most fun.	s
When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did.	s
On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in her delivery of lines & comedic timing - even though she was hardly in the film (I'd say the same about Ben Kingsley).	s
If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine.	s
His choice of films, the basic 'conceit' of the production (which places him in the sets or simulacra of the films he is commenting on ) and his delivery are brilliant!	s
He then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment.	s
Daylight enters only on very temporary sufferance, and director of photography Joseph LaShelle makes the most of the alleys and brownstones, the docks and the El.	s
The beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose.	s
The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning.	s
the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension.	s
If I should pick a favourite scene, then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered, a suspenseful edge of your seat moment.	s
I liked the film.	s
I thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and I could understand why.	s
This movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene imitating Psycho, graphic violence towards women and solid story.	s
From what I've read about differences between Automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time.	s
That's a good thing.	s
The film does not come across as cheap.	s
The way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water, and the way that water can be made inspiration, and comfort, and cleansing, and etc.	s
It is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video. "	s
Favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't.	s
Do see it!	s
Virgil Manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse.Chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property,Manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods.He reports the crime to the police but there's no body to be found.Troubled by disturbing visions,he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn"Soft for Digging" is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare.This minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue.Some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent.The location sets provide plenty of creepiness:the eerie Maryland woods rival those used in "The Blair Witch Projcect".Give this strange horror film a chance.9 out of 10.	s
I miss Dark Angel!..	s
The opening shots of Khan's film promises great cinemaa derelict Harilal Gandhi is brought to Sion Hospital, Bombay (Mumbai) barely mumbling that his father is Bapu (the popular name of Mahatma Gandhi), father to an entire nation.	s
The entire 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N.	s
I, too, was cast aside because I wasn't good enough for his family, and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet, I was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying Vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn't believe he loved.	s
However, you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit.	s
Dalton as the tough sheriff and Railsback as "redneck-villain".	s
He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real.	s
The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.	s
The rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace.	s
When Voight uttered the line "Once upon a time...", I must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny.	s
The good rapport between Denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here, in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages.	s
There's lots of good stuff here.	s
And: Smooth Criminal, is really the most wonderful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life!!	s
But maybe that IS Lynch.	s
I fear that Grand Canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non-new releases at the video store.	s
Most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number!	s
This is a similar problem that also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series--just too many different actors playing the leading man.	s
I was never bored by it, even though I watched it at 3 am.	s
Some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes, and the climactic confrontation.	s
Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see Batman and Superman together.	s
Dennis Quaid was one reason, but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me.	s
In fact, I can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role.	s
Lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good, and show good morals, and Christian values.	s
Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark.	s
Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns.	s
And the oxygen in ship was running short.	s
Ned Beatty(Life) is also good in an extremely hard role, come on getting raped by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.	s
Like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly.	s
Quick and simple, I love this movie.	s
and he has teeth.	s
The acting follows suit -- outrageously hammy on everyone's part.	s
In medieval times, when the Black Death (now widely believed to have been bubonic plague) swept across the civilised world, killing a third of Europe's population, many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil.	s
The film opens with a rising dawn, the chirping of birds and a vast landscape, introducing the sense of rustic harmony present throughout the film.	s
That's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy.	s
I had a great afternoon seeing this film while Hamburg was drowning in rain outside, and I wish films like this from France would get a regular release in Germany.	s
The last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound, running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing.	s
It dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional.	s
There wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion.	s
All much in the style back then.	s
And i think my money was on right way as i expected before buying it.	s
I would recommend it as "must-watch-once".	s
Others in the cast are Charles Middleton, Gail Patrick, Donald Meek, Barbara Fritchie, Toby Wing and Lona Andre.	s
I am not too big a fan of baseball, but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc.	s
Surely an insight into Gandhi's personal life.	s
In other words, spring!	s
About the form of of life's nooks and desire like fight's form.	s
That is why when Mathieu goes looking for Pierre at his house, appears to be hard to imagine.	s
Instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious!	s
That he fails in Bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered, not the political triumph.	s
And people knew who Dave Coulier was.	s
It's one that when its on its hard to shut off.	s
The House of the Spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue, South American politics and super-natural powers.	s
The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy.	s
Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed.	s
It is just like what the movie Just Follow Law by Jack Neo would have mentioned - Often when we are ourselves, we don't see the person in us we are, but when only when we are in another person's body, then only would we learn to see who we really are.	s
This movie is about a troubled girl, living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family.	s
IN the cartoon, titled BETTY BOOP WITH HENRY: THE FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; basically being a one situational exercise; being punctuated with the usual array of Dave Fleischer's rapid fire, machine gun-like gags.	s
His use of shadows is quietly effective.	s
She also makes a deal with the CIA to get her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of prison (he'd helped Henry escape the country in the original Henry Fool film.)	s
Personnaly I really loved this movie, and it particularly moved me.	s
it had the aunts in it (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and she's about to get married but she runs off with Harvey the end.	s
J. J. Anderson playing the very young Halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines.	s
Ok, maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was my "first" (Cannonball Run doesn't count!!)	s
He finally comes to his senses  his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back & he himself is beaten up in his home.	s
Extras, however are no great shakes except for a radio version of "Jeopardy" and trailers for both movies.	s
Star Trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by Roddenberry 10 years later.	s
is that it's a children's show, FOR CHILDREN so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy, forced, and probably stupid.	s
Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room.	s
I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story.	s
DANIEL DAY-LEWIS certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), much to his mother's fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken.	s
to those saying this movie stinks.	s
My Grade: B-  DVD Extras: 5 minute Roger Corman interview; Cast & crew Bios; Original Trailer; and Trailers for "Candy Stripe Nurses" (with nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with nudity), & "Crazy Mama"  Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold, and some others all show skin	s
SEE THIS MOVIE.	s
The dream sequences are right out of an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, as Tony finds himself transformed into an Average Joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed-up identities while on a cross-country business trip.	s
Reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than even an NC-17 would allow.	s
Is it one of the best of the "Nightmare" series?	s
Very "campy" performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting dull.	s
Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in Reality.	s
Even though some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary?	s
What more could you ask for, you might ask?	s
But alas, they torture him.	s
Only this time Sherry's spinster sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole fine romance by falling for Bake's robust seafaring buddy, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a sort of use 'em up and toss 'em out kind of guy, thus forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general.	s
The cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen Technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television.	s
I'd compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style maybe with mixed with a little bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!).	s
And when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.	s
Well worth a rental!	s
Also, there's some strong support by the always reliable Brennan, Roman (who's great), the incredibly cute Corrine Calvet, and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy, the kind that doesn't take himself too seriously.	s
The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience (the woman wears the mask of tragedy, the man represents the comical interludes) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you.	s
He was the mightiest, but also vengeful and petty.	s
It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the premier in Tel-Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war has began...) This problem in communication between the people, that causes wars, is interesting me for a long time, and it doesn't matter who- boys and girls, straight and gays, Jews and Arabs...	s
from the website.	s
A lovely old - fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch,"Red Rock West" follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker Mr N.Cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond.	s
A true classic.	s
What I feel is that Coccio portrayed two individuals desperate to make a statement of superiority a gesture of their power yet who have no reasonable venue for it.	s
I never bothered to see this movie in theaters although I remember hearing the name over and over.	s
The songs, though charming, have nothing to do with this particular film, and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma standards.	s
That may be because I can see the characters as my own grandparents, attempting to make sense of a world at war.	s
Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt-out music legend Oliver Courtney.	s
Spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience.	s
Donna Reed charming and pretty.	s
And as the scene of the crime, it is a most inviting deathtrap indeed.	s
was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror.	s
It is definitely one of the top ten comedies made.	s
The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing too.	s
And then, as I was watching it, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman into my bones.	s
One of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place; a big, beautiful brownstone in Manhattan which she's able to get dirt-cheap, (that should've been the BIG red flag - cheap real estate in New York!	s
Flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her.	s
I enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in.	s
Story--The conflict in a 'balkanized' Denmark is volatile, as we saw recently jihad murders in the Netherlands and riots in France.	s
The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.	s
He probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the Death Star's destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.	s
Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe.	s
Majkowski is a true genius here.	s
The actors themselves are fantastic, displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job.	s
Two birds with one stone, you know.	s
This is because of two main reasons: The littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and well-written elements.	s
Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994.	s
But these are failings of the movie but conscious choices.	s
I'm not going to argue which one is better, but I will contend to the idea that they share the same message.	s
Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please.	s
Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs.	s
And it's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too (that kids may not fully understand, but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off, and adults watching will surely get quicker as I have now watching this film again now in my mid-twenties) where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit/demon in exchange for something else.	s
Over the 13 weeks of this televised competition, the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants.	s
The most dramatic event of the Revolution happens off screen.	s
Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other.	s
Go ahead; I'll wait.	s
Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in Alexandria, Egypt.	s
The audience loved it and I believe it ended up winning the award for the best film.	s
Well, how is it as a whole?	s
Shakespeare was talky, too.	s
Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area, so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area.	s
If anything, the Inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power.	s
You should not take what I am about to say lightly.	s
I don't know where this movie has gone.	s
The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job.	s
This gal wasn't afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far away from the rest of the villagers.	s
Mildred at first rebuffs the love-sick Philip but later realizing just what a sap he is takes advantage of his feelings for her.	s
The locations are great, too (I want to visit the nightclub).	s
It's just so wonderful and fun to view.	s
Won over by David's love for Anansa, and conscious of his own inability to find love, he agrees to take David up in his helicopter to help search for Anansa.	s
The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar.	s
In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually did his own singing here!	s
The story and writing, though, are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals.	s
A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen, later marrying Prince Albert, than ending with the birth of their first of nine children.	s
Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying.	s
Richard Attenborough, however, takes a more sympathetic view of his achievements.	s
There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps.	s
The plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original...the demons are roaming in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called "Demon Wardens" are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of Ashura, the demon goddess who's sleeping and supposedly is very kick-ass.	s
He is straight at last.	s
From their collective output, only a few movies (or may I say just one?)	s
The ending makes little or no sense.	s
I know it disappointed a lot of his fans.	s
This is where we get our quote of the movie: "Tell me about Gabe."	s
I give this film 10 stars out of 10.	s
If you have a chance to see this movie, I recommend that you do.	s
I don't think there will ever be any other version of Jane Ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one.	s
In fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the NEW CEO and once again she's on top (perhaps in more way than one).	s
Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner.	s
I cried when I saw this sequence.	s
I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for.	s
I don't know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very deeply.	s
Where the first Hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" manages to connect everything, and brings it all home in the end.	s
Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.	s
The film has a bright, cartoonish look, anticipating the Pop Art of the early 1960s.	s
At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming.	s
In his previous 'role' - and the theatricality of his position is crucial - he had one set of traits; in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite.	s
A solid comedy with a warm heart, and all the better that it was totally unexpected.	s
This was my favourite film as a child, and I have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and I doubt anybody could ever re-make the story of Oliver Twist on screen, any better than this one did.	s
Little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world.	s
Being the prototype of the classical Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (what an exquisite beauty!)	s
It Had Black Humor, Good Suspense, Nice Looking Girls, and Of Course, a Psycho Killer.	s
Imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people.	s
Buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art.	s
The acting was strong across the board with a very interesting international cast.	s
It is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, clever, good natured and a good time.	s
What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity.	s
He's not bad in the film.	s
I love the character's daring to even initiate the love affair.	s
If they were to actually open their eyes for once, they would see that DePalma has staked his career in thrillers and is actually the best craftsman.	s
Before seeing this, I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated "Emmanuelle" series starring Sylvia Kristel.	s
This is a non-documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the 'system' in its ass.	s
Those same people usually love "E.R.	s
However, it was a pleasant surprise.	s
The film copy I watched was grainy, and at times suffered from a reddish/orange tint, a visual trait I have noticed in other films from the same time period.	s
As a human being, it touched my heart and soul.	s
Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India's most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection.	s
and yeah, angie is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments.	s
I saw this in the theater, though it was "fair," but on DVD, it was far better.	s
It's not quite as glossy as the Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better.	s
It was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck has her work cut out for her.	s
All aspect are spot on, the portrayal of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even small Irish subtleties have been covered.	s
Overall, however, "Kalifornia" is an entertaining film, thanks to a clever concept, great scenery, especially in the second half, good cinematography, great dialogue, and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis.	s
The Sopranos (now preparing to end) is the very peak of adult television and drama.	s
Go check it out.	s
The native Americans want their land and their way of life back.	s
So, too, is much of the rich, poetic original dialogue.	s
A rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home.	s
Best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one.	s
Mitch loves her too, but Kyle wins her.	s
Okay, so he found Simone's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her (even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously)?	s
Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids.	s
From the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says "I will love you forever" to the wrong girl, and is stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together...), to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man, only to find herself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses, and one I only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey (and the injuries and penalties that go with it) - dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series.	s
I think this movie is absolutely beautiful.	s
It gives the realistic settings, but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era.	s
There are a few excessively shot gore scenes - the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes.	s
Like another reviewer, i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it!	s
So if you've got beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should actually SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?	s
The result was enchanting.	s
You also certainly wondered how things went.	s
I really can't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year.	s
You have been warned... by Dane Youssef	s
I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee.	s
The mere fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film.	s
I'm not sure where she'll go or who she'll end up with, but I was very impressed with her acting.	s
Every character is touching, and interpretation is close to perfection.	s
This was an excellent 2-part episode, although I had never been seen the older ones, I never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal, extra terrestial of course but not paranormal.	s
It does not help matters when, during a skirmish on the streets of Lexington someone jostles Nathan's arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound Nancy's dad!	s
If you can take the violence and the language, this is a great show, an unrelenting portrait of New Jersey mob life.	s
Not really!	s
This film is too uneven in style to be a classic, varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium.	s
Given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president, this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance.	s
Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show.	s
Have no illusions, this IS a morality story.	s
But it delivers what you want in an Arnie movie and that is action and entertainment.	s
Already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are televised for their "entertainment value".	s
Fortunately, the bosses at Sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to Digi Corp and Morgan becomes a double agent.	s
Ultimately, however, probably insignificant.	s
It's pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger's movie.	s
The "edge of dreamland" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently EQ'd scores.	s
She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason, that makes him decent, that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long, if ever.	s
I know I was.	s
He finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit.	s
Mary Astor is very lovely here.	s
Who cares?	s
After you have finished this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, Stargate: Atlantis.	s
Me and my girlfriend, Annette, watched this together and we'll both comment.	s
this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action It's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is Rome Italy thats the best place ever the actors are great Mary-Kate Olsen is such a great actress she plays Charlie and thats a great character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and thats a great character to love When in Rome love it.	s
But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting.	s
The cutting and Montage is inventive and artistic, without the movie being an "art" picture, but a highly entertaining one.	s
Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show.	s
Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to David's birthday party.	s
The story and Director Dave Fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip-like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little Henry.	s
While this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough.	s
Have fun!	s
Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows, but it was because of this, among some other financial and creative woes, that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971.	s
The original benefited from a huge number of things---it was all in black and white, it had a great jazz score and it was filmed at the real locations, including the home of the doomed Clutter family.	s
One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava.	s
I've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was.	s
I have to say despite it's reviews Angels in the Outfield was a pretty good movie.	s
It should go pretty well.	s
She has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen tough-girl role very early in her career (and pull it off), which is a feat that should be recognized.	s
Angelina Jolie was also really good.	s
The last half hour borders on melodrama, but the film earns every one of its tears--and unless you're made of stone, there will be plenty of them.	s
In this, of course, he's much more elegant than in "Vertigo."	s
So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off.	s
It is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end.	s
The film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends.	s
When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good.	s
From there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is, with some of the best character development, story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time.	s
I got the first Bill and Ted movie for christmas and I had to get the second when I saw it in a store.	s
Recommended for those who are ever curious about Kings and Queens in the British Monarchy, only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned.	s
Taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among Hollywood's most celebrated immigrants  Emil Jannings.	s
Overall, a truly wonderful film.	s
She does selective roles but shines in them.	s
I loved this movie, and I am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it, or so it seems.	s
If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid stuff.	s
Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón looks to be practicing the amazing long-takes he perfects in Children of Men with this tale of two people in love, walking down the street.	s
When a well off, got it made couple with a nice apartment and great life get the notion to adopt this idea was tailor made for them.	s
I'm only a child.	s
Yet, it's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures, for it's played straight, thus making it even funnier.	s
I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show.	s
Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'ol Web Head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library.	s
They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match.	s
It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history.	s
Grain is still present.	s
And why?	s
Few movies in the 1980's were as good as "Moonstruck"and it's funny too.	s
First, any play on "...of the living dead" invokes His Holiness Mr. Romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire.	s
He does, however, walk the line between light and dark.	s
I give this film a 9/10.	s
The poor pooch, under a threat of having to take a bath, as to NOT react when the stupid flea causes him pain.	s
Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened.	s
Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison.	s
The reason I felt this way was because I was so impressed with every aspect of this production.	s
I didn't know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly', but absolutely loved it.	s
The supporting cast are likewise excellent: Linda Hoffman as Feinstone's bitchy, unfaithful wife Brooke, Earl Boen as smarmy, meddlesome IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as feisty assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as perky assistant Karen, Jan Hoag as jolly office manager Candy, Virginya Keehne as sweet, gawky teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as thorough, no-nonsense Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs' equally shrewd partner Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner Matt, and Mark Ruffalo as on the make sleazeball Steve Landers.	s
The series is very well made, does not show its age, and our kids at various ages really like to watch it.	s
Patricia Barry is perfect as the plant expert from the Museum of Natural History.	s
Totally memorable - like she really exists.	s
The protagonist is a lady in her forties, living in her mansion, breeding orchids, and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so-called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her.	s
Going through all the evidence Columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that Edmund must have left some evidence inside the safe in writing to who his killer is.	s
But this is what makes 'Presque rien' even more interesting.	s
This is an excellent movie.	s
Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s.	s
One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including "A Matter of Life and Death" (aka "Stairway to Heaven") and "The Red Shoes."	s
We sympathize with May, but she, too, causes her daughter's suffering.	s
Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter).	s
A bit of trivia that I am surmising about: Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film, "Ball of Fire."	s
This film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire Hollywood films of this sort.	s
I suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters; legions of devoted Page fans and the curious will see to that.	s
Definitely worth the see.	s
The tug of wills between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the source material and is tense, suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions.	s
The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny.	s
In Offside, Panahi's seriocomic tribute to Iranian women standing up for their rights, I don't think he's as successful.	s
Now, I have a few problems with this film.	s
It's one of my favorite show ever.	s
If the film's title helps the US audience to explore random chaos, all the better.	s
One wonders, finally, if Trelkovksy _is_ the prior tenant.	s
Maybe that was the point of the film.	s
It answers the questions: What happens when 4 rambunctious, eager to party sailors are on leave in a small British coastal town?	s
How?).	s
I would love to see how it ends.	s
i also found that i look a lot like jean Lafitte if he were white.	s
I gave it a 10.	s
Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine).	s
You should try and enjoy it too!	s
His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation.	s
Item: Jane prefers a guileless, if wise and resourceful, savage (Tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine-to-five man (Holt).	s
If you've seen more than a couple Gialli, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings.	s
Two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief.	s
If this movie was meant to scare its audience, I think it missed its calling.	s
It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes.	s
Cinderella In my opinion greatest love story ever told i loved it as a kid and i love it now a wonderful Disney masterpiece this is 1 of my favorite movies i love Disney.	s
A raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy..and I loved it.	s
Terrific film with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to get cooking.	s
So make sure that you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good.	s
It is lovely.	s
If you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race satisfying.	s
Today's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969.	s
This is one movie you don't want to miss.	s
While being very funny and entertaining, Tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute.	s
Mostly, though, McLaglen is firmly in control, especially when his character is almost totally blotto (which is difficult for an actor to do believably), and he also plays Gypo Nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen McLaglen later in his career, in "The Quiet Man."	s
He learns to speak later in the film, it is very good for a guy like him.	s
When I saw the end, where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people, then commit suicide, and it made me grab my stomach.	s
I enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and still watch it on a weekly basis.	s
I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor.	s
And to speak of, it's not really dirty or disgusting either.	s
The vivid sound recording by Jan McLaughlin deserves to be especially noted.	s
The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema.	s
What is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film, I have to put it into my DVD player, so I was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found, as I have looked everywhere I can think sporadically over the past 5 years.	s
Why did I enjoy the show to the last episode?	s
The plot is brilliantly worked, and Preminger excellently balances several plot points; but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character.	s
movie starts with Abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage.	s
I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.	s
Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners.	s
I like my Ronald Colman dashing and debonair, the fellow you see in such films as If I Were King and Kismet.	s
Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid.	s
You must be patient and instead, note the details here.	s
That's simply not true and a little unfair.	s
Right up with the best in any western.	s
The musical score is endearing and heart warming.	s
The couple rushes to his aid.	s
This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but does have good writing, great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing Richard.	s
Its the planet Saurious-7.	s
It's just a story, a very weird one I admit, but after all, only a weird story.	s
In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).	s
The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time.	s
Thank goodness because I got to see "The League of Gentlemen" in order, complete and uncut.	s
Now, when I hear the first few chords of that song, tears spring to my eyes, Pavlovian and unbidden -- not sure if it's the music, or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet, charming message of empowerment.	s
Although Olivia was the focus, I would have liked to have seen one of the "fictitious" shorts take a jab at Gary's Barry Manilow impersonation, whic h was equally ridiculous.	s
My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around heaven.	s
The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene & when Pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs.	s
Hermione Gingold delivers a stellar performance as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many movie credits to mention except as Ms. Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") was wonderful as Ms. Novak's absent-minded-yet-capable upstairs neighbor Queenie.	s
Lol.	s
This is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business.	s
There is a rare Chad Everett appearance as the older Jimmy Bruno.	s
MYSTERY MEN has got to be THE stupidest film I've ever seen, but what a film!	s
It does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered, which is good enough for me.	s
I rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it.	s
My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story?	s
To begin with, this isn't even a process shot, the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real.	s
Then - the performances.	s
Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows.....within minutes!	s
The one thing I didn't like about the film is their idea of surrogacy.	s
For the record, I have seen all the longer Poirot/Suchet films.	s
I and you shall enjoy this together.	s
Is it a plot to steal an inheritance?	s
When it comes to Thompson, it's not what it's about, it's how it's about it (to quote Roger Ebert).	s
In a way, it's a cornerstone of the film in that it's Carl's memory of his father that helps carry him through hard times.	s
Movies like this are more than just movies; they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more.	s
For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD.	s
A superior and self-indulgent narcissist, you know?	s
I, for one still haven't lost faith in him and I'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory.	s
After this movie a slew of Bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus.	s
The most profound scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school.	s
Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausicãa, which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus.	s
To be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex jokes aplenty.	s
As a songwriter and an actor, though, he has serious chops, IMHO.	s
If you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening, this is the film for you!	s
A terrific find by whoever cast her!	s
There are many stories inside this one...many people are touched, and the culture of China opens itself for our Western eye to observe.	s
In spite, of Brosnan's detached, grunting style, in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate, dedicated man.	s
It won't win any awards, but it just has to be watched to be appreciated.	s
And know this, if you have the original video of this, you'll find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, gotta love that guy, ahehehe.	s
Bill Pullman was miscast as the lawyer.	s
Mannequins come to life and attack her.	s
The former prizefighter, who once faced Joe Louis in the ring, delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life.	s
The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess," uses analogies of "hot air balloon juice" here to present the above message.	s
Yes.	s
It turns out the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with Lukas.	s
The only trouble with the film, as I can see it, is that Robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond Hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot.	s
An earlier work of Miike's, Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his usual in the ol' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts, though it's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces.	s
My vote is ten.	s
In any event, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re-shooting of the other, with all "Brotherhood of the Protector" scenes re-shot as "Archdiocese" scenes, or vice versa.	s
Gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades.	s
You will enjoy Chances Are.	s
That, I think, is the main message Mike Binder's newest film Reign Over Me brings across.	s
Perhaps it wasn't directed or written as well as it could have been but I am telling you that Danes and Gere together make this movie completely watchable and a really great thriller.	s
They then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg.	s
At the end of this movie, we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others, especially, 'Sub-Zero.'	s
If I was to complain about one thing, it's how uneven the songs were.	s
An important lesson to anyone interested in what "really" goes on in the world.	s
But "Moon Child" isn't an action movie!	s
He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother.	s
The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on.	s
She's casts a profile that a feminist would love to trounce, but understand where she's coming from and going all the way.	s
But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoor's film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes.	s
And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic.	s
What's interesting about it is that it is a Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it IN japan with the original crew!	s
it would have been better (although this of course was covered, I do not think it got as much time as it warranted).	s
It is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum Vietnam, and this movie-sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire- did it.	s
there's an episode on their love lives,jobs etc.	s
Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for children, and 'Time At The Top' does nothing to discount this theory!	s
so goes the famous poem penned by Rudyard Kipling.	s
Don't get me wrong there are some great features (the short 'Chase Me' is awesome) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan.	s
As far as the scene about logic, it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level.	s
Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here, I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlain's guilt.	s
The range of different types of people is great.	s
The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan parallel many a Shakespeare play, and Central Park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around Macbeth's castle.	s
Anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one-liners and cheap gore.	s
Shintarô Katsu, best known for the Zatôichi films, again stars in this third and final movie in the Kenji Misumi (mostly known for "Lone Wolf and Cub), directed saga of Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami feature the big dicked one battling ninjas, rapeing 'ghosts', and uncovering shady goings on at the Shogunate treasury.	s
In any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of Goodman's orchestra at their best.	s
I'm only a child.	s
The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace, strangely enough, in one of Cédric's past lovers Pierre (Nils Ohlund) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.	s
I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York.	s
It's a document.	s
I won't tell you what its about, I'm sure you already read the summary.	s
In fact, it reminded me of the Montmarte sequence of Moulin Rouge where the camera sweepingly focuses in to the windmill creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happening.	s
Which makes sense, as Guevara has to endure low morale from his men, betrayals from those around him, constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants, and by ultimately the enclosing, larger military force.	s
The documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path, a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey, and an elephant mama with her small (maybe not so small, they are elephants) offspring migrating in Africa.	s
Give it a try.	s
Two brothers - Silvio the elder (Néstor Cantillana) and Victor the younger (Juan Pablo Miranda) - have moved to Santiago from their home in Temuco after their parents' death and Silvio works to support Victor's education.	s
Anyway, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie.	s
Raul Julia plays Santa Anna who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history.	s
Her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved.	s
What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard.	s
Bergman's Polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions.	s
The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in "Empire".	s
Because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote: you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her.	s
The way he shows us is surely passable, although it requires a huge amount of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical nonconformism.	s
So it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after Nash was sent to prison.	s
Emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought.	s
Now, after they're picked up by the coppers they get little Donald home.	s
Their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast, which features Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, and members of the Andy Warhol clique, offers itself as an essential part of the storyline.	s
Comments: Actually much better than expected.	s
The story is plodding.	s
There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones.	s
Billy Zane is stunning as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy.	s
I just found DVD of Yank Tanks there, great doc, but how sad for it to end up as a rock-bottom remainder.	s
Still, there is the beach, the luminosity, the lightness e simplicity of summer, the freshness of breeze, the surge&#8217;s melody, and the expressive eyes of an introverted Elkaïm (hesitant, hurt, puzzled, passionate).	s
But his night was not over yet.	s
I believe a lot of people down rated the movie, NOT because of the lack of quality.	s
Bon cinéma !	s
All that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters, as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life.	s
but each to their own!	s
And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.	s
I also understand that the producers had their own, unique style, and that there were many hands in the soup.	s
Private Snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine (something you won't see in any other Hollywood films of the era) and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling.	s
This film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts.	s
What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry.	s
How can't you rate this movie with 10/10?	s
While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table.	s
I was impressed with Gary Cole's sinister sheriff and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black.	s
This title is nearly impossible to attain; but for those who are Bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether.	s
I didn't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie.	s
Same goes for the endearing relationship between Alfred and Bernie.	s
Of course, that's far from an end to it.	s
Her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother.	s
It's important to note for those politically correct types--they kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse.	s
The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye punctured with a needle, and so forth.	s
This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met.	s
There is very little objectionable about this film, but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it.	s
The movie has a great written genre story.	s
Opens a tobacco shop, of course!	s
I like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "South Park's" "Blame Canada": "Blame wheat!"	s
Hardly.	s
A first-rate job all around.	s
Fantastical and real.	s
Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar.	s
I was young film student in 1979 when the Union of the Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and premiered Konchalovsky's "Siberiade"; Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn marathon".	s
Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening.	s
Headlining, we have LORD OF THE RINGS (Peter Jackson, 2001-2003) star Viggo Mortensen (and for all those so inclined, yes, he does get naked) whose performance is not only highly believable, but is done with such skill that his Eastwood-esquire character is both bad-to-the-bone and likable (a very delicate mix).	s
I agree that many Australian films have been lacklustre recently, but 'Peaches' delivers the goods.	s
It's a catalog of '30s Warner Bros. sensibilities.	s
With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) providing the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history.	s
RVD broke away and soon after leveled Brock with a kick to the temple.	s
There were no consequences.	s
Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun.	s
Her body language.	s
Rose would follow this film with "Candyman" (1992), a true 'thinking person's' horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite.	s
Lola Lane especially is just lousy trying to play Mona for comedy.	s
I will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too.	s
This is a crying shame.	s
If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking.	s
in a not so conventional sense of the word.	s
Camera-work is nice, and there are some great shots of the nature on the island.	s
My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too.	s
Angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity, reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures, gazes, sounds, and music, when he believes that words can only take us so far.	s
However, I must confess that I most enjoyed the delicious turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbour Mr. Theopolis, essentially playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or, for those who've seen the film, wouldn't that read even better here as the Corpse Pride?)	s
Okay, I didn't get the Purgatory thing the first time I watched this episode.	s
He makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive.	s
As I read the awful opinions about the movie I actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that I did.	s
This sort of filmed in-joke is the sequel to Hal Hartley's Henry Fool, which was made ten years earlier.	s
I have to check out his other movies.	s
You want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness.	s
Also, instead of just riding waves, we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before.	s
And I gave it a high 7..... Why?	s
A tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase.	s
Im a testament to that.	s
It portrays true love and passion, and not just "heat."	s
That cannot be tolerated.	s
Dialogue was never very important to the WAI and often absurdly unintelligible (thought there are exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967).	s
And in the great dramatic scene when he, kneeling and weeping at his own grave, begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life, we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively.	s
After her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt.	s
No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.	s
Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film.	s
There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and I smiled most of the way through.	s
He runs into Stanley Adams, a Professor Rollo, who realizes that Mulligan is from c. 1890 (he mentions President Cleveland).	s
But an essential film?	s
Some might consider it "corny" but i consider it "classic" filmaking and acting at its best.	s
Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght.	s
First of all, the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the Ridge facility expolsion.	s
Alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago.	s
Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower.	s
She and Gloria Grahame played the same sort of tramps--and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.	s
Irving Berlin provided the film's music and lyrics, and each musical number is enjoyably lighthearted and entertaining, even if they aren't quite as memorable as those in 'Top Hat (1935),' 'Swing Time (1936)' or 'Shall We Dance (1937).'	s
I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield nor of war-dramas, but I was truly wondering just how and when Winfield would find his child.	s
Later Rinatro directed a wonderful looking METROPOLIS (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines.	s
Magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing.	s
I never get tired of seeing DeeDee mess up his Pizza lines or Joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over, haha.	s
Going into seeing this movie I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea.	s
Not so long ago the BBC aired an excellent dramatisation of Jean Rhys' enlightened and most unsettling riposte to Bronte, "Wide Sargasso Sea", imagining the back-story of the first Mrs Rochester.	s
I thought, however, that Hopper and Boyle's characters were left undeveloped, as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it.	s
This is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies.	s
It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season.	s
I found it a highly enjoyable look at history.	s
The dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant, and the script was also fantastic.	s
As a real fan of TV's DEADWOOD, I'll tell you the performances of Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are far more on-target.	s
I first watched SpaceCamp at a drive-in movie.	s
Do we remember what 1984 was like?	s
What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging.	s
The only really negative thing about this film, are the several pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film perhaps look a little dated.	s
She also points out about what future both of them would have together, which proves to be true.	s
Since we have a good old-fashioned video-store in Tucson, I had the chance to watch this 3 1/2-hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten seconds.	s
Those who did not like it, I say to each his own, but Pokémon fans will love it.	s
Having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer.	s
So, is the story ridiculous?	s
The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period.	s
This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist.	s
It was a good movie, though not for everyone.	s
Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word.	s
I would have loved to see where it could have went.You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone.	s
This Peabody Award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st Season where a holodeck malfunction traps Captain Picard, Beverly, Data, and a Starfleet historian named Waylan within a 1930's San Francisco setting.	s
The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures.	s
On the one hand, you have to give the Armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it.	s
I just can't agree with the above comment - there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one, it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence.	s
It's possible that Christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word "God" in it, but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this, especially in the modern world where Christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some.	s
Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give quite good performances here.	s
The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing "The best film of the year," and it absolutely falls nothing short of that.	s
It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child.	s
I believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie.	s
Jesus walks to a funk soundtrack.	s
Same facts, some of the same lines from the case record, but deeper, more complex, with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed Roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is.	s
Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the troupe as roles are self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed and ultimately performed.	s
The whole series is over 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war.	s
In addition, he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people, etc.	s
Sometimes a miracle happens.	s
The emotional expression was very believable, which caused my emotions to spill out.	s
I still have the tape, I haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get around to it this week, and be a kid for the day.	s
Coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after World War II saw an unprecedented exodus of Americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes.	s
It's your mind and thoughts we long for.	s
Ronald Colman gives a terrific performance as a stage actor who really gets into his work.	s
But All In All I Loved It, I Thought That Dirt's Wisecracks were pretty funny.	s
We also get introduced to some of the troubled students - most notably Helen, also brilliantly played by Nathalie Press, who's into self-mutilation.	s
However, all the rest is O.K.	s
That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur.	s
don't let the subject matter put you off.	s
The War affected everyone and that lesson is not forgotten in a movie that isn't afraid to entertain as it teaches.	s
But in all seriousness, it was good.	s
This, like many other movies, is not for everyone.	s
The school bully, Joe and his "team" of friends start teasing Billy and calling him "worm boy".	s
The plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one.	s
Emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south, promising to relocate the family when he finds it.	s
The constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else.	s
Just like his first film, it's catered towards a certain audience (I highly doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career).	s
I think it will do well.	s
There are some things I will never understand; why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example.	s
The History Channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of WWII but an expansive series such as the World At War has not been successfully attempted since the original.	s
If any one knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com I would really appreciate it.	s
In this sequel, the same five people, lead by Challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land.	s
It's well integrated with the script, as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism.	s
The dialouge and the acting is very odd; odd in a rambling sort of way.	s
The sets are outstanding and very impressive, the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "Everytown" is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is just charming, believable and ideally cast as "the hero".	s
OK, I will not elongate my review exploration on "Earth" to infinity, but I must stand my ground on why this is a "must see".	s
A big part of its success is Miko Hughes as baby Gage.	s
Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "Missed me".	s
Bruce has never tried to bank on his "ash" image, and it's obvious that he didn't get involved with "Hatred" so that it could do so either.	s
I loved this film, you just don't get to see gem's like this every day.	s
Where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life?	s
The ultra-high contrast images (sometimes so high-contrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible) and incredible detail are always impressive, always a joy to behold.	s
It's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens.	s
Sex: B (Solid, very solid sex scenes.	s
Also, I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked.	s
Other than that, I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD!!	s
Flavia, our protagonist, is a young lady who encounters a fallen Muslim on a battlefield.	s
The fairy tale (part Pretty Woman, part reverse Pretty Woman), the very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street -like performance by Kelly Lynch, the escapism.	s
More than twenty years before Peter Jackson's visionary adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings, there was this 1978 animated effort from director Ralph Bakshi.	s
The.	s
It's Bob Newhart's best role, for instance.	s
Or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life.	s
I might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it (the DVD includes an English dub), but, like all of Miike's films, it can tend to move very slowly.	s
This gave him confidence.	s
Even more startling are the drawings she's made that (SPOILER!)	s
The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the world's best living comic actor), and the late lamented George Burns make for a comic masterpiece.	s
This is a really good film and one that I've enjoyed watching several times.	s
You tell yourself you don't need it or it isn't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening.	s
But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area.	s
The direction, photography, and editing are also first-rate, and it's a great time capsule of London in the '60s.	s
Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth.	s
Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs.	s
Mark: 6.	s
In the film's most devastating moment, May drops to her knees before Darren, willing to do anything for him, only asking him to be kind.	s
Like this is Lynch passing gas between his real pieces of film art.	s
The film is about a guy who steals only Porsches.	s
Thats called art, and art isn't dumb.	s
Also Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as the director of the short.	s
Felix's wife leaves him at the start of the movie, and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy Oscar.	s
Of course, the film is polluted by Mr Dung's potty-mouthed dialogue and all-tactics-of-toilet-seat obsession to vilify fat people, leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher, but there is roses among manure.	s
For those who aren't familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "The Forever War."	s
The voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on, though I would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations.	s
The investment in environment beyond all.	s
The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point.	s
Here is one movie that is genuinely funny at every single moment that it covers.	s
Erich Rohmer's "L'Anglaise et le duc" makes a perfect companion piece to Peter Watkins' "La Commune (Paris 1871)."	s
Very good luck for the Ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market (which sadly never happened until after the bands demise).	s
As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition.	s
Darryl Hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with Castle on "The Tingler," and there's enough footage to give us an idea of the level of Castle's talent--not very high, but very energetic.	s
In any event, the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in-consequence.	s
I remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty.	s
Holt is very good here in a leading-man role.	s
I heard it was to be demolished...) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks.	s
The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another.	s
The film also has some amazing costumes.	s
The latter theme is the film's strongest and it would've been nice for Sheridan and co-adapter Shane Connaughton to really flesh that out.	s
It's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies.	s
Jacob's Ladder, Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - that should form together at least the concept of a dark night... NUIT NOIRE.	s
Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time-place combination to live in!	s
While this is true, Bollywood films in general are geared to a specific audience and should be appreciated for accomplishing their aims in this regard.	s
She goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper...	s
Maybe because I didn't expect anything at all when I watched it.	s
Raul Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police.	s
Like maggots in a rotting cheese, human figures scurry through the city's byways.	s
This film's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number.	s
Grisby makes Michael an offer - he wants (for reasons connected to his so-called fatalistic view of modern society) to drop out of it, pretending to be dead.	s
Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison.	s
They have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background.	s
That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end.	s
It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit.	s
What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common.	s
Vivid drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written screenplay.	s
The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield.	s
It's silly, but you know that going on.	s
But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret (you will see in the absolutely stunning finale!).	s
Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always gotten him out of difficulty.	s
I couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.	s
Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.	s
This is his ultimate film.	s
I wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is.	s
If this is not Amicus' best film, it's certainly one of them.	s
The movie's basic plot is well chronicled, a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity.	s
Ah, afraid they might sue, so he changed them into men.	s
In the dark, you are back in the beginning of time.	s
THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.	s
The quality of animation leaves room for complaint.	s
Otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy, and gives a rare look into the Navy's LTA operations.	s
Besides, anyone who reads the IMDb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens next...	s
My vote is nine.	s
The love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot--more of a thriller.	s
Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled up into one.	s
Not bad.	s
The soundtrack is all 80s!	s
To me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies with NO idea of what is going to happen, so therefore I think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers!	s
ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!!	s
Keep the rare gems coming Hollywood, 10/10.	s
Its a MUST see.	s
Can anyone give me a best list for the 90's and on up to 2006?	s
The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film-- acting, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity, and artistry--on a scale for 10 for very good, 5 for average, and 1 for needs help.	s
WE laughed at the silly kissing scenes, but that is what is great about old movies!	s
This was a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely going to watch the repeat.	s
Post production was a nightmare.	s
OK, that gives a more negative feeling than what I actually had watching the movie.	s
The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the cop .	s
Still the best, many say.	s
meaty role as Megha, a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the Delhi marriage registrar's office for her boyfriend Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi) to meet her.	s
That's way too funny.	s
The success of 'Gung Ho' actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC.	s
Again, I give this movie a seven...it's good but not great.	s
The confident and streetwise Silvio, the elder brother, gets a job working for a sleazy strip club's owner after taking the naive Victor there for his 17th birthday.	s
Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug/vamp routines.	s
It's extremely critical of US military intervention in the middle-east, and as such, it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour.	s
Since it was a French - Italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg.	s
This show is well worth it!!!	s
A very pessimistic movie.	s
Highly recommended for genre fans.	s
The whole plot could be considered formulaic.	s
With a dentist as killer, gory scenes are expected, and Brian Yuzna delivers great SFX in the correct amount.	s
I really enjoyed the detail that went into the script.	s
The Smooth Criminal fragment - the greatest song ever, full of Moonwalks, group dance acts and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this film one of Jackson's masterpieces with an even good-looking (and white...) Michael Jackson!	s
The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious.	s
Even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him, he only goes to her after he's (supposedly) rejected by another woman and learns that Connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him.	s
The final scenes magnify the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations.	s
Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, that did not leave too much room for any gunfights.	s
Everybody who has a chance to see the movie, go!!	s
However, are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire?	s
The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager.	s
Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I have long despaired of ever finding.	s
Two of the best films about rock's subculture have been directed by women: Penelope Spheeris's The Decline Of Western Civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released.	s
The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot.	s
It's supposed to be a fun, yet stupid movie, that doesn't require one to think, only to enjoy it.	s
Twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that I believe anybody can enjoy.	s
A surprise emotional ending.	s
This film is a great fun.	s
I can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone, even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks.	s
It has a good, 1980 country soundtrack, featuring "Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places", "The Devil Went Down to Georgia", and "Hello Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett.	s
And while it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series.	s
What we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real.	s
They are "Place des Fêtes" that I've mentioned already, "Père-Lachaise" directed by Wes Craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever, Oscar Wilde (Alexander Payne, the director of "Sideways") who would save one troubled relationship.	s
Mmm, yes a sequel indeed.	s
If their scenario looks like they are glorifying it ,then its a Nazi website skip it .Go to IHF or German wartime films dot com, Amazon dot Dee or German video dot net.	s
It's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that doesn't assault your brain's visual center, but rather, draws upon one's empathetic imagination to experience other's suffering of mind and spirit.	s
Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best.	s
I graduated from high school the year the movie was made, so maybe I can relate to it better.	s
Anyone who expects the old in-an-out" of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film.	s
Most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of Christmas present showing Scrooge the two children hidden under his robe (you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays!).	s
Just a few ways to describe this movie.	s
But I'd have to say that The Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline.	s
But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful photography.	s
Liked the movie?	s
And so I really love this movie.	s
During the murder spree, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) works hard to find Michael before he unleashes his fury.	s
Although it is not 'Finding Nemo' quality graphics, it is still very good.	s
Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the Fourth series in the continuing Gundam chronicles.	s
It is about regular people, people we all know, who suffer a little in their life and have some baggage to carry around.	s
I love the Broadway musical.	s
Being an American History teacher, I felt an obligation, almost, to see this film and as far as the history went, it wasn't bad.	s
There were certain things about it that hit *very* close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed.	s
There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who's run away with his brother (!)	s
I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back again.	s
Good silent drama.	s
Off the blocks let me just say that I am a huge zombie fan so I don't make statements like the above lightly.	s
Even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples) still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today.	s
It isn't so much that Beckinsale is better -- they are both very good -- but that the screenplay is better.	s
The DVD extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie,though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most (myself included) interested.	s
What a thrill ride!	s
It became a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we'd quote from it at the drop of a hat ("I'm going home in a bag!").	s
The chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about Anthony Nicholls awful wig!!).	s
Rory Kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow who lives with his mum and isn't up to much, but who turns out to have hidden depths.	s
He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst.	s
Might even be on DVD by now,at least I hope it is.	s
Later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security who is staying in Lisa's hotel.	s
England has never been like this.	s
His intention, I believe, was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down, so to speak.	s
There are some very nice moments in the film, such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them.	s
Scott is right.	s
The storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike.	s
It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants.	s
Overall, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, despite its flaws is a must-see for fans of the Amicus anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies.	s
The undead birds were original, for example, and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well.	s
It pulls some "standard" pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them.	s
He apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys.	s
I got smitten and forgot anything else existed once I saw this movie.	s
The twist here is that these two are really married  to each other.	s
I won't give away too much of the story, as I do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers, however, I will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in Japanese animation (anime).	s
Its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and I believe people can learn a lot from reading this book.	s
It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids.	s
Wilson (Erica Gavin) is nabbed by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation, marking the directing debut of Jonathan Demme.	s
I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian Jerry Stiller the father of Ben Stiller.	s
A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house.	s
should be.	s
Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in third-class.	s
It's a wonder to look at this world, which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers (i.e.	s
Gee runs for mayor and gets shot.	s
I can't recall ever seeing a popular, mainstream film where all the main characters were Jamaican; had believable accents; and weren't stereotypical with the beanies.	s
Everything from super-slow-motion to what appears to be a finely-tuned mechanically-controlled time-lapse photography, was put to use to provide some (and I caution, only "some") stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films.	s
With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does.	s
Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due.	s
Sergio Martino's The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre.	s
Had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life.	s
I am an extremely jaded movie buff.	s
Her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her.	s
Helena Bonham-Carter, pre-film stardom, is Raina, the daughter of a military family, who has a peacock of a fiancé (Patrick Ryecart), and who shelters a soldier from the enemy (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the town.	s
The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK.	s
I've seen the trailer for this many times on YouTube and honestly found that rather scary.	s
Anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies.	s
I am fourteen, and I feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words.	s
this movie is the best i love it and everyone should!	s
Thanks for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada	s
Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won it.	s
Never afraid to poke fun at themselves!!!!!	s
The story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one.	s
I haven't read the book but I hope to one of these days.	s
Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids.	s
It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact.	s
Jiøí Trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism, which caused him trouble in his native Czechoslovakia.	s
When I watch Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason the prime directive came into being.	s
The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all.	s
A pause.	s
A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards.	s
It was responsible for launching Claire Denis' career and with good reason: it's an incredible directorial debut.	s
The director took his time to allow these characters to truly get to know each other.	s
And hits on Hauser(Cusack).	s
The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there's a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing!	s
Nevertheless, this film is not solely about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs.	s
Great script, good one-liners, fine acting.	s
This film was void of all the video whore clichés, and it also skipped the gangsters, rappers, and foul language.	s
Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own.	s
There are many reasons to see this film even so, not least of which are the amazing b&w noir cinematography of W. Mott Hopfel III (complete with old fashioned wipes and dissolves), the 1950's-faithful acting of the cast under the direction of Mary Harron, pitch-perfect performances by some of our most underrated supporting actors (including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak), not to mention the Oscar-worthy and technically difficult lead performance of Gretchen Mol.	s
The narration from O'Hara is joyously self mocking, and we get good light relief by way of a court case with Everett Sloane considerably lighting up proceedings.	s

Know-All”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick), British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun.	s
The first was good and original.	s

Most of the Atomic Age monster movies I saw on television as a kid- and some of them, THE BLOB included, scared the daylights outta me.	s

Certainly he looks like no one else of the time, that skull-like face, flattened nose, and elongated body-- even now he remains an unsettling presence.	s

This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong.	s

Anton Newcomb's case is more interesting.	s
After seeing several movies of Villaronga, I had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about a rhythm of the movie.	s
A snappy script and an all-star cast including Jimmy Cagney, the lovely Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keeler make this film a cut above the rest.	s
I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet.	s
Not an easy task, given the location for filming.	s
After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making.	s
people make much noise about the egyptian segment, by Chahine, because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are "fair targets" for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack, but this ignores much else in the piece: several perspectives are discussed, no one being held up as the truth, and critics--if they even saw the piece--seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue, and the director's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy.	s
A film that makes you think is not one to avoid.	s
Haunted by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he doesn't know.	s

It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies", it was that pat.	s
I'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made.	s
The technical mastery is astounding.	s
But it's the stunning delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent, searching script, based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.	s
Honey, I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger, and to me, A Bug's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities.	s
The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film.	s
ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances.	s
This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity.	s
The Invisible Ray is great fun, aside from the Gothic opening it's interesting to see Universal move the action around to Africa and Paris.	s
By that time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has made its mark as one of the great chase films, bursting with wild energy.	s
The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time.	s
I say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and, as such, there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits.	s

In a story like this, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be victimized, exception made to MARINA, which is the only person who doesn't know what's going on and didn't betray anyone  This film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like São Paulo, where crime is every day's presence.	s
As Welles voice-over proves to use, O'Hara indeed does not use his brain very much 'expect to be thinking of her (Elsa)'.	s
If you think that a film can't fatigue in some way, then you haven't seen Dog Bite Dog.	s
And why would Fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network?	s
Being that I'm LDS and regard Joseph as a prophet, I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times...which I presume is expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie started!	s

I understand why some of you dislike this movie.	s
Billy Zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger.	s
I have heard the detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with, and that this was being shown on television (just two years after Elvis's death!)	s
Renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman, and then we see Craig's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements.	s
The good ol' boys.	s
It was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness; for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas.	s
Sure it's got some blood splattering, all in good fun though.	s
There is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of "common people", of sliding into a kind of reverse "holier than thou" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject.	s
Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance.	s
He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs.	s
This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders.	s
This movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it.	s
Toto with his pants.	s
Penelope Cruz turns in an outstanding, if not exceptional performance, as well, as Sofia, the woman of David's dreams.	s
I too was disappointed by the effects, in particular the "Thunderchild" scene, which I regard as one of the most exciting in the book.	s
You see, I have wanted to watch this movie again for over twenty-five years.	s
It's just like Billy Connolly's voice over, God likes that 70's stuff!	s
The second half entirely about Donald Woods carries less of an emotional punch, but is compensated by how it is shot, performed and written.	s
The 3rd and in my view the best of the Blackadder series.	s
Sung first by Astaire and later danced to by the pair, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen.	s
The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish.	s
Unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out.	s
But in Reed Hadley`s "Zorro`s Fighting Legion" (serial 1939) the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who Zorro really is.	s

After the movie was over, we just sat there unable to moved.	s
The Odd Couple is a comic gem.	s
The Pensacolians are coming.	s
Red Eye is not the kind of movie that's going to win the Palme D'or, but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director, anyway, and his branding is a good indication of what a film-goer can expect.	s
His performance is superior.	s
Seems real.	s
If you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast(the same case as with TAR).Star World, the broadcasters in this country, did a bang up job in presenting the show.	s
The visuals are better than average, and the generally cold colors aid the purpose of the short.	s
As the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together.	s
Basically, don't knock the film until you've seen it, and then don't knock it until you've tried to understand what the Olsen twins do: they encourage young girls to be creative, intuitive, and driven young women.	s
There after, Bill and Ted experience death and must find their way through Hell, with inhabitants that happens to include the duo's worst memories, and then through Heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends... and their show.	s
My favorite movie.	s
Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal.	s
She has him strip down completely.	s
Therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen.	s
This isn't to say that it's not without its flaws - I thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long.	s
Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not featured much, thankfully, since Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles.	s
The stirring Alfred Newman sound score, with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years.	s
The Earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: Dr. McCoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of Lewis Carroll's work.	s
Maybe not small children as they may get scared.	s
He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits.	s
Of course not!	s
Merciless, thoughtful, ironic, quirky, and dark, this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while, begging for answers to impossible questions.	s
In any case, this is something of no importance here: My critique is upon the film per se, and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9/10.	s
Cant wait for RKS next movie and the next AB, Akshay movie they always seem to do well together... e.g.	s
He gets some really funny lines, some of which are homages to other films, like "Round up the usual suspects!"	s

Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie.	s

Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel.	s
In this movie, the Muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success, and it's a lot harder to do that, especially in the entertainment business, than they initially thought.	s
Although I give this movie a 4.	s
The surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting.	s
As for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and though Isabel Bingley's voice outshines that of Jean Simmons, it is not more pleasant.	s
As long as you go into this movie knowing that it's terrible: bad acting, bad "effects," bad story, bad... everything, then you'll love it.	s
Robbie the Robot epitomized the Asimov robots, and was the inspiration for all that followed, from C3PO to Data.	s
That means you're no threat to anyone").	s
What can we ask more of a film?	s
Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here, with the projector's beam flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders swathed in white fur, her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen.	s
yeah, it's a bit of a silly film, so if you are looking for an oscar performance, forget this one......but, if you love John Candy's humor, this is a must-see.	s
Put yourself into Carla's shoes.	s
The rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentionsRay, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!	s
Although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is in fact nothing of the sort.	s
I honestly think this show would still be running if John Ritter God rest his soul i wish he hadn't passed away.	s
If you see this will be on the telly, WATCH IT, otherwise, run out now to RENT IT!!	s
Samurai Troopers/Ronin Warriors is a classic, and an all-time one of my faves.	s
Funny but not as good as the first film.	s
The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb.	s
As a side-note, the fact that a movie produced by evangelical Christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation, couched in explicitly evangelical Christian language, imagery, and theology is also perfectly acceptable.	s
Fenwick, the big and limited English defender, was booked - he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area.	s
DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.	s
The dialog between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film's end is equally good.	s
I know, you thoroughly enjoy belittling every movie you don't like, and every person that likes them, but maybe you could hold off just this once.	s
Any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed!	s
It sticks out like a "turd in a punchbowl"!!	s
I also liked how the characters come off realistically.	s

Most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave, but in the last scene, after Pimlico has rejoined the UK the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain.	s
Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Preminger's 'Where the Sidewalks Ends,' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry' by Frank Rosenberg... Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks...	s
The second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat.	s
You probably all already know this by now, but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on ABC.com I've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show, ever.	s
Though they cover the ins and outs of the race well, there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars, which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing.	s
I really enjoyed the addition of the song "Adelaide"... wish some guy would sing like that to ME.	s
The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with Gable, who was her most frequent leading man.	s
So, funny?	s
There isn't a plot, so to speak; the film is more of a collection of various skits; as the films protagonists wander around Los Angeles in their legendary haze.	s
Since I had already seen the original, when I saw this on Sci Fi Channel- I don't know if this remake was deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was within the first few minutes.	s
This bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because I woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first.	s
I am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved, matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school... and possibly the guy playing a retard!	s
The May-December relationship between Kelly's character and Nina's reminded me of the same "kept man" relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany's.	s

This scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as Elton has no interest in Harriet, but has fallen in love with Emma herself.	s
Any chop socky fan can apperciate this.	s
This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite Pabst-directed films and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX).	s
I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival.	s
I loved them all.	s
There were 10 people in the audience, among them Crispin Glover, if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is.	s
For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom was talking to a official from the Home Office.	s
I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time.	s
OR, maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytelling.	s
Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but Granger plays his part perfectly.	s
This is a musical about ghetto life in Victorian London, and while the scenery and set designs are stark, dark, and true to that way of life, it is flat out bizarre for people to be breaking out into such ridiculous songs amidst their misery.	s
Dana Andrews furnishes a complex character unfolded through his streaks of violence and the hatred that always infests him.	s
The rehearsals more often than not turn into off-key shambles.	s
The dancers & questions, the round-about fashion they're presented only add to the shows appeal.	s
It makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes.	s
The DVD has some extras, but I wish it has many more.	s
And she does not get sufficient support from Reitman and Payne.	s
It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu.	s
It's been so long since I've read the book I don't feel comfortable commenting on the movie's faithfulness to it.	s
I think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera.	s
It captured the themes of the story brilliantly.	s
If you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters.	s
Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.	s
It's a movie to keep you interested forever.	s
They learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives, and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage.	s
Lyrical and truthful, it stays with you long into the night, much like those terrifying CBS Radio Mystery Theatre shows.	s
The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk's performance.	s
When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, half an hour into the opening episode, it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time.	s

Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was director Sergio Martino's follow-up to the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh.	s
Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a marvel, and after a while I quit wondering why in the heck he would want to pick Spike up from prison and continue a friendship, due to Glenaan's great performance.	s
It's a crying shame that one of the all-round best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated (which shouldn't be incredibly hard - though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation, the film's main themes should be accessible to all).	s
So when the series actually gets on TV (allegedly mid-season in '99-00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90's, will live once more.	s
Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo.	s
Even as a youngster I was interested in all sports and that included horse racing.	s
Maybe that's why the final fade is on a shot of Independence Hall and the inspiring strains of "America the Beautiful" swell in the back.	s
Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time.	s
Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER)whereas some of them are magical and among the best films I've ever seen (THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS).	s
It was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks', but generally each character had its part in the story.	s
Before the heart warming ending we learn all the misadventures of Paulie.	s
The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story.	s
It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no-one untouched.	s
Of course, we can go back to Howard Hawks's Red River (1948) or further still to John Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946), but if we want to stick with this single decade, then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that era's initial year.	s
It's a truly great, understated performance, her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played.	s
For this purpose, the madhouse is the ideal setting, and the writers knew this.	s
If you watch any other version of Jane Eyre without reading the book, it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day.	s
First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold.	s
Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.	s
Also notice that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano.	s
The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing.	s
David Lynch, better known for less accessible material, crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise.	s
And it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself!	s
I know for myself what I have done fascinated by someone who is younger than I am!	s
Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer.	s
Be sure to read the great novel.	s
Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War.	s
They could almost have had a psychic connection to old Jane!	s
As with all great documentaries, the filmmaker was just lucky enough (or smart enough, or prepared enough) to be at the right place at the right time, and she's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do "what's best for the kids" as it does about the kids themselves.	s
Her facial expressions and body language become more attractive, and focus mainly goes to her.	s
I imagine that, as one poster suggested, Christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene, but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil, to be smiling at Shemp's possibly dying.	s
This French film is quite interesting to watch, the technique part is innovatory, like "Waking Life" I recently watched.	s
The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings.	s
This was a typical grade B movie in 1940s Hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations.	s

ROB ROY is a very nice movie, very well directed, photographed and acted.	s
Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh.	s
Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not.	s

Honestly though I feel that ABC could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality TV shows.	s
Undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups.	s
In today's modern world a woman in Jane's situation wouldn't think twice but to stay with Rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her.	s
I came out surprised and very amused.	s

King Vidor's direction is one of the principle reasons for this.	s

The only unifying force in the film is Claire Denis's own sense of what fits together.	s
It's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls.	s
Still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films I've seen for quite some time.	s
Why wasn't it released to a wider audience?	s
I didn't know it when I entered the theater room, but this might be the movie I've been waiting for a decade.	s
with his trusty lash.	s
He finds himself gently pushed this way and that, but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless.	s
This film is a great adventure.	s
Except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with stunning cinematography.	s

In the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan`s song of a dying country.	s
The story line is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the film.	s
It is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the Broadway hopefuls.	s
The film makers make the film more than just another documentary.	s
And it is true that something is not seen a thousand times, is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner, but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do.	s
A rare glimpse of movie star Viola Dana, this film is a lot of fun.	s

In the film, a World championship match is depicted, as between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin.	s
Well, because its interesting and Bronstein and the lead actor, Dore Mann, do an excellent job.	s

The only victim is going to be the insurance company.	s
Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance.	s
Stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid, a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on.	s
Excellent cast, particularly Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy/action.	s
Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles.	s
In fact i haven't seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it.	s
And this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain.	s
So May finds herself superfluous to both of her children's needs, and finally does return home (but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new).	s
Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging, deep in the woods, a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near.	s
The idea here is to have FUN & ENJOY yourself.	s
As it stands, I would rate this similarly to a BBC-TV adaptation of classic literature.	s
who star in this must have been really desperate for a job, or we're just friends.	s
It was amazing to hear them speak to each other, and reminisce about all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them.	s
I think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, that's proto-fascist: The characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers, who are turned off by the body of a 70+ year old woman, dancing with all her charms for her lover.	s
This movie is one of the all-time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability.	s
and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time.	s
Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is second to none in the indie world.	s
Cheadle's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and Sandler's doesn't mind because all that was before he met his wife.	s
Oh hell.	s
Its about time that Gunga Din is released on DVD.	s
It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's, and as such, it's a marvelously entertaining movie.	s
This movie is what made the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees so popular, singing his song, "I'm nobodies I Love You".	s
The premise is that of a paperback book hero, like Doc.	s
There are certain things I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, though, like how the humorous side is more apparent.	s
Indeed, Davies and the already arrived Haines become comedy stars.	s
In a way, Zero Day is very comparable to "The Blair Witch Project".	s
The main setting was also very neat; Anton's apartment is very roomy, and he has some cool devices, especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world's occurrences.	s
Quite a few were "Epilepsy", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs or were "Suicide from Hanging".	s
I liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the Amazon, a part of the world that always has intrigued me.	s

The problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full.	s
As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies.	s
Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writer's Vicente Blasco Ibanez's work Entre Naranjos.	s
There's a definite link to a later Wallace-based film, the excellent giallo "Whatever Happened to Solange?	s
Unlike any other Asian film I watch featuring gangsters, this one is not an action movie.	s
I recently saw I.Q.	s
My evaluation: 8/10 I like a lot this movie.	s
The eldest of the children J.J. played by Jimmy Walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief.	s
It's creamed full of special effects and nothing, at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic...it's pretty amazing.	s
Also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth.	s
This great gag is trumped, however, by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off elevators at the wrong time.	s
Far-fetched?	s
LOL!!!	s
Whooo Whooo!	s
Unfortunately, because of US viewers' tendency to shun subtitles, this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits.	s
Again a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city.	s
If you feel, as he did, that the film "does not work", then you're saying, I think, that Howard does not work.	s
Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it!	s
This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship.	s
But their production was to develop and contain at that time, believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center.	s
I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I found out about this young man's legend.	s
Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down.	s
In comparison to other movies that were written regarding Columbine high school this one is the best.	s
At one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the Navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared.	s
Errol Flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim.	s
If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks...	s
Women and performers (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in China.	s

It was a fast paced, highly enjoyable movie.	s
Most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a North American film.	s
Before watching it I'd read that it was rather boring, so I braced myself for a very slow movie - though I love me a slow movie.	s
The plane's functions don't change once throughout the series(continuity like that is hard to come by also), and unlike most other "super-planes" of other cartoons, it doesn't have one single weapon on board(unless you count mangoes!	s
I wanted "Dumbo," but my sisters won out, and we got "Cinderella."	s
They might as well have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones?	s
As the other comments, I also say - buy this one.	s
The animation was actually excellent, like Charlie's dream.	s
In short, Henry spots a puppy in the window of Betty Boop's Pet Shop.	s
Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day.	s
Favorite Line: When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car, shakes his head and says: "F***in' story of my life."	s
It was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but I think the great parts where already in the trailers, if you catch my drift.	s
William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief.	s
What a lovely and delightful movie!	s
And for girl on girl action, vampiric or not...this movie just rocks!!	s
Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are fantastic "stalkers" as well and I find the producers don't try to overkill the fight scenes.	s
Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries, loads of featurettes and various galleries.	s
Nevertheless, I think Moon Child should be a movie everyone should consider watching.	s
It is one of my favorites.	s
Never in my life have I wanted cauliflower, milk, and baguettes this much.	s
These Pre-Code films today seem tame, but they aroused controversy galore and contained more racy material than most movies until the late 1950s when the Code began to erode.	s
The show revolves round mob boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two.	s
After a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around, comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl.	s

Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the United Kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers.	s
Fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it.	s
Along the way, they also add in a few interesting bits of business.	s
We see the cops in the movie inveigh against "the traitors who gave Stalin the A-bomb".	s
but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya.	s
I was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game.	s
But the wife has some devastating news.	s
But other than that, there are some nice touches in the story, such as the old elevator panel, found in the apartment of the woman who secretly invented and installed the time machine, not having a space for the lock that activates the time machine feature.	s
Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre.	s
Since I'm from Chicago, I had already known Winfrey from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide).	s
This is a story of life and living.	s
It is one of those movies where it can't get boring.	s
He usually has the nice guy roles.	s
It's pretty cool.	s
And yeah, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you watch it.	s
Some of the mole men were famous too.	s
Quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside.	s
The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie.	s
My entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it.	s
A remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come.	s
She even asks Jesus, why the father, son and holy ghost are all men.	s
Overall, worth purchasing.	s
There's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip.	s
Nicole Kidman is gorgeous as usual, and I am very curious about her Russian: is she speaking Russian in a correct accent indeed, or just faking?	s
There was no laughter track - I hadn't seen this on an American TV comedy at the time except for on Larry Sanders and it really worked well here, heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that, and not just hamming it up for the cameras.	s
But this one topped them all.	s
The ending makes no sense.	s
In most versions of this tale, the scene with Marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film, simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly, and the results are usually just plain silly (ooooh, look, it's a scary ghost.......not!)	s
Members of our club the ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear in it as extras!	s
In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks.	s
I haven't read Gerard Reves book, on which the film is based, but I still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self-conceited poet/writer who gets his (in a way - no spoiling here).	s
While not denying the great entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter.	s
The director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.	s
I was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for Anil Kapoor for producing such a classy movie.	s
This movie reeks of soul and atmosphere.	s
Performed and acted out (or posed, if you want) by the greats of the Japanese animation industry no less, as the project was supposed to be as low-budget as possible.	s
They all think he belongs in a nuthouse!	s
It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters.	s
There is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, you shouldn't have too much problems.	s
Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll.	s
This affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending.	s
She had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film.	s
Now that George is dead, Elizabeth no longer has to practice playing sax in the attic.	s
Teenage girls looking for Britney Spears' records, a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue, trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks, while those at home are watching the local edition of Pop Idol.	s
And mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film, from the opening giant wheel in the movie house, to Petiot's bicycle (with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives), to the Victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill.	s
It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension.	s
The film takes place in the late 1970's, in South Africa.	s
John Wayne may get talked about more, but his good pal Stewart made some excellent, hard-edged westerns too, some with the great director Anthony Mann.	s
It's hilarious.	s
The moment in the movie, when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn.	s
Films like this one show the proud spirit of the Iranian people in spite of their present difficulties, and it's my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them.	s
I mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film.	s
I think I understood only 80% of the dialog.	s
We have seen it on TV before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it.	s
Chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation.	s
The vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman, and begs to be involved in his operation.	s
Highly recommended.	s
Alexander Knox, ( Wilhelm Gimm)"Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town.	s
That actor IS the nightmare from Capote's dishonest imaginings.	s
She makes a pass at Vivian, who seems startled and says to her, "Oh...I'm...not that way."	s
Seldom have I seen a movie that so compelled my eyes.	s
I love cartoons.	s
It has some acting flaws (Belafonte especially), the script wanders around, sometimes.	s
Baldrick doesn't change from last season... he's still rather pathetic and stupid, leading to "silly" humor.	s
However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark.	s
While Philip is mainly Danish, he went to school in Germany and had in-laws who were of German background.	s
God, it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy.	s
Another Downey must-see!	s
About Richard Benjamin: I personally find his acting annoying in general, and his work in this movie is no exception -- although he has some fine moments here.	s
Made in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai was one of the big films made by Welles after returning from relative exile for making Citizen Kane.	s
and AB... what can I say.	s
It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact.	s
The Evans family are a poor Afro-American family living in a tower block.	s
Better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains.	s
Camera angles and colors are very well chosen.	s
But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming "I don't have any change!!"	s
A tough and assured King, David however has affairs of the heart causing great problems.	s
This is one of Harlin's best film.	s
They tried to use giant Skinkons to take over the planet.".	s
The writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story!	s
In the end, Hartley's sharp dialog combined with the amazing performances of a perfectly matched ensemble cast makes for a delicious cinematic cocktail.	s
This movie deserve a place alongside movies like The Pianist, Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.	s
I read the back of the movie and knew it was God's hand at work for me to purchase this movie.	s
However, 2001 is perfectly coherent compared to the rambling narrative of this film.	s
Like many other European movies, this movie has an unashamed, non-judgmental attitude toward sex, nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and/or surrealistic (some would say blasphemous) images.	s
And despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of Thornfield convincingly.	s
Beckinsale, in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody-two-shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison.	s
As we hear later in the movie, the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter Marie.	s
I suppose everything does come back to money... it's too bad that there are now no other shows on ABC that actually make you feel good after watching.	s
The camera work is splendid.	s
First, lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt.	s
First of all, I find this short-film very entertaining and interesting.	s
I am currently hunting for a copy to purchase.	s
My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not.	s
Duckies and Bunnies?	s
I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it!	s
Dressed in a creamy satin sailor outfit, she also sings the same song most winningly near the beginning of the film.	s
It is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion.	s
It did win numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director etc for their "Oscar" awards.	s
Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome, this is a voyage of discovery where Ben gets to know his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is, and not the mythical figure he has in his mind.	s
Together, they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play.	s
France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was.	s
I cannot, however, agree with bgs1614,who says that the film could earn an 'R' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that.	s
It's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness.	s
When she and Albert argued, I loved it, I could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may be just me.	s
While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career.	s
I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it.	s
There may be a plot, but what I understood of that I picked up from the description on the Netflix DVD sleeve.	s
Fun!	s
His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto.	s
I dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach "Queen Mary" Well that boat is haunted.	s
This is one of the most brilliant movies that I have seen in recent times.	s
Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there isn't a part of the book I liked less, only parts I enjoyed more.	s

Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away.	s
This was a common gag at WB, but it has since been purged from this cartoon and several others, including `Horton.'	s
As it stands, it's still an admirable version of the original.	s
Performances.	s
Carefully hiding, Holmes and Watson watch as a woman comes in, who turns out to be a victim of collateral damage from Milverton's past activities, and who shoots the blackmailer to death.	s
One significant point, many Poirot watchers don't recognize good acting or good characterization.	s
Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky.	s
What makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.This film is definitely in the tradition of such British line classics such as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory."	s
Having said that, here's more...	s
Through the coarse of events Kei's true nature is shown, yet no one shuns him away.	s
So did Walter Matthau(this is the first time I've ever seen him perform).	s
Barbara Parkins played the young bride.	s
I hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad!	s
I had pleasure to watch the short film "The Cure", by first time director Ryan Jafri.	s
The chilling jazz score by Quincy Jones is the capper.	s
He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una.	s
The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times.	s
The fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun.	s
I liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity.	s
It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey.	s
The musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done, even though I'm not a too big fan of the genre itself.	s
She is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 "Detour" character, "Ann Savage."	s
But really this entire film is one big, recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see.	s
I don't know...Maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious action(hajj)but I just felt the movie is so underrated.	s
Jason Alexander, oh my gawd, is there anything he can't do?	s
And that is refreshing.	s
Sadly Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies.	s
Barbra Streisand's debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history - in any media.	s
According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes which is about Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy, and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost.	s
the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off!	s
Red Skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease.	s
Frechette was as reckless in person, as his character was in this film.	s
Certain elements of this film are dated, of course.	s
In the movie Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as Timon having trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats!	s
She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things.	s
A good Japanese flick for a rainy summer night.	s
The animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film "Robin Hood" and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are plenty of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in "Robin Hood".	s
However, she just lacked the drive to make her entirely sympathetic.	s
All in all, I must say this movie is amazing, moving, and I highly recommend it.	s
All the ingredients are here: old jelousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty.	s
It just isn't like that anymore--the NY they show no longer exists.	s
The use of facial image throughout the film is superb, and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family (mother) is spot on.	s
I got a huge kick out of this movie.	s
It's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most (over)used story lines in cinema!	s
We are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event, meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective "advanced" nations.	s

Probably one of the better looking Blu-rays I've seen so far.	s
This would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham.	s
Adam does a great job of, not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters.	s
I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I?	s

They're blunt, awkward and annoyingly confused about everything.	s
Stacy Peralta has followed up Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big-wave surfing culture in America.	s

That was a long time ago, but you wouldn't know that seeing her in action with Abby--she looked like an old pro.	s
I happen to think in a calm moment: What is happening in the lives of all these people on the street?	s

Taylor Momsen!	s
I was expecting it to be the kind of All American Propaganda that we here in Europe dislike so much.	s
And there are a few...	s
Although I may not have agreed with Peck's interpretation of the main role, there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness.	s
Ultimately, just give it a go.	s
A dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail.	s
It's a sword/sorcery picture, has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil aide/sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature....you get the point.	s
Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role.	s
It's pretty easy to fast-forward through if you're trying to pay attention to Milligan's original film, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes.	s
Series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety, and I recently got the chance to watch it all, the best part of 4 decades on.	s
Smoking, gambling, hitting on chicks, eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him.	s
My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr.	s

He's got a keen ear for dialects, it seems.	s
Puro's (the protagonist) growth as a person would be better illustrated -- at least for western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture -- if her character's "back story" were more fully developed in the early part of the film.	s
It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness.	s
The direction is of good standard, however while watching the movie I got a made for TV movie feeling.	s
Rating: 8	s
It's obvious: Everybody knows zombies by now (at least the Horror fans by heart and the others through the "Dawn of the Dead" reinvention or Resident Evil movies etc.)	s
Before you give your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet "critics" aren't commenting on, give my fave' show a spin.	s
Security in English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically.	s
Still the movie drags a little at some points.	s
However!	s
However, I was rather disappointed with Ben Kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster.	s
Her harsh, uneducated French is a very stark contrast to the authentic accents we've been listening to until this pointjust off-kilter enough to be both funny and totally true to the story.	s
The "badness" of this movie seems to come naturally.	s
The story: On the island Texel, photographer Bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen.	s

And if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time Elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book, then rest assured, you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face.	s
I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job.	s
Then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again.	s
Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault, the film has no victims, except Lily's childhood, which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father.	s
It gets kind of silly at times, but overall I recommend it.	s
How one person can be seen as the link to so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded so many things.	s
There is no special agency involved in the plot.	s
Madhur Bhandarkar goes all out to touch upon taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society.	s
I look forward to more from the director and this cast!	s

The story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action.	s
Or "Feardotcom"?????	s
Kobayashi may never get what he wants, but he dares his destiny and ¡§just does it.¡¨ This series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds, but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy.	s
So many low budget cam corder looking movies are coming out these days.	s
In this case, Marvin the Martian has an assignment to bring back an earthling.	s
Some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging, others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe.	s

Atul Kulkarni packs a punch, as does Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul.	s
But that isn't quite accurate.	s

I will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers.	s
The drawings of his huge teeth chomping right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog's dialog made me laugh out loud a few times.	s
The effects are really good as well just think "Land of the Lost".	s
It's Universal!	s
All in all, a 10 out of 10.	s
To give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy, but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate, so I will instead focus on the witty dialogue.	s
Strong-willed Victoria would have none of it, and refused to go along with Conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans.	s
In addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre.	s
People were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here.	s
Oh, those sneaky Italians.	s
The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots.	s
Naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting-wise, but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution.	s
In the main, however, this is, appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together, an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film.	s
Anyway, a really cute film that I recommend.	s
While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, most of the cast of "Lost" are, in truth, spectacular actors for their respective parts, projecting heart and humour in their performances.	s
None of the characters act as anticipated (she is not like that pliable victim from "In the Company of Men," not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line (well, until the last shot, but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a hectic modern office, to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs.	s
The number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love.	s
Those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple, how word like "democracy" and "freedom" are banded around, but once the training begins they become "enemy" and "kill" and "destroy".	s

One famous story, told by director Harold J. Kennedy, has Ginger Rogers insisting that her then husband, William Marshall, who was not an actor, costar with her.	s
There is just such a raw truth that I feel when I watch the movie and its not the kind of truth that you have to dig for its right in front of your face.	s
I guess I did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for Americans, and a few of them aren't very good at hiding their English accents.	s
This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here.	s
I wont give it away, but it could be improved.	s
In the book a lot of Mildred's stock phrases such as "you're a gentleman in every sense of the word", "I don't mind", and "Mr. High and Mighty" were associated with prostitutes and when Phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that.	s
And it wasn't just the cast that did it for me.	s
Everyone convinced?	s
The theatre was basically empty; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me, and it was as though I had, not only the big screen to myself, but, indeed, the entire planet Earth.	s

Also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones, sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke.	s
I'm walkin' here!"	s
There is lots of humor, garish colors and no lulls.	s
In one episode a player responds to another player's desperate, "I'm trying as hard as I can!"	s
I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.	s
A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution.	s
Indeed, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties( A German, not an Indian).	s
But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn (genie) nearly a thousand feet tall!	s
I liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hook us in, but not enough to bog down.	s
This was Richard's Farnworth's last role before he died, and it's definitely one that he will be remembered for.	s
Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that David saw Chris have in his dreams.	s
Anyone who does not find this movie funny, does not understand simple comedy.	s
Recommended for those with an interest in India.	s
Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle.	s
Already a success by doing sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit Broadway play to film and does it with style.	s
Spock's encyclopedic knowledge of Starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence.	s
As for the plot, it is shown in uneven, rather complicated way.	s
This re-make, which aired on ABC in 1995, is far more faithful to the original script, and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this film.)	s
Caution: you may even grow while watching this movie!	s
Not having this movie on DVD helped make the purchase easier.	s
I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me.	s
I had friends who were picked on for one thing or another .... too fat, too skinny, too feminine, being a bully, not being smart enough, only having one parent .... you name it!	s
I cannot wait to see it again!	s
This is a nice piece of work.	s
PERIOD !!.	s
Eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed.	s
First part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists, whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach Sweden.	s

Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle's.	s
Like most of Panahi's work, his armature cast's performance was superb.	s
But there was one weakness (though well hidden) in the film.	s
The two friends literally have to run for their lives.	s
This movie started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle.	s
I didn't buy the dinner sequence.	s
He starts doing Prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts.	s
Perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do, but that is no excuse to lower our guard.	s
Gary Merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss Scalise, but he doesn't seem mean enough for the role, and I think that an actor like Richard Conte (who played Mr. Brown in 'The Big Combo (1955)') would have better suited the character; I hadn't realised this, but Conte appeared just one year earlier in Preminger's 'Whirlpool (1949).'	s
The ending was also very smart.	s
The brutal violence, cool character designs, and good pacing, make this one of the best fantasies around.	s
Based on possible true experiences that the author had back in the 1840s.	s
Visually well-done and much more entertaining and memorable.	s
The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself.	s
In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior: -overall atmosphere (it feels more like Middle-Earth) -overall voice acting -music (I really dig the fantasy score by Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of the John Hurt's finest roles) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (He's not some fairy hippie in this one!)	s
I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope YOU do.	s
The biggest gaff comes in the "I Love Lucy" recreation scenes, at least a few of them.	s
It continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them.	s
The chemistry between Bill and Ben's character's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series.	s
But the layers of De Palma's directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it.	s
I rate the actress playing the role of Bhabhi in the front league.	s
The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the casting was quite perfect.	s
It's quite a cute and appealing film even now.	s
Too bad it didn't last.	s
This is apparently one of Shemp's first shorts with the Stooges.	s
It was a revelation to us.	s
The joke among soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he did a lot of concerts at military bases).	s
Rob Roy is a stubborn, proud, courageous, and honest man whose word can be trusted.	s
Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City.	s
One of the best parts of Sundance is seeing movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss.	s
The set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric.	s
They live in an empty and very filthy apartment.	s
I went to the movie together with my two small daughters, but I recommend it to adults as well, given that they appreciate this kind of movie.	s
While the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible.	s
I think) They sneak off after a party and do it.	s
This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center.	s
The plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco troupe.	s
As in the original, the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre-war America.	s
I agree with the few who see in Eric Roberts' work a magnificent performance, Shakespearean in its range, yet played with heartbreaking sincerity.	s
I haven't deleted my initial post on this film, because I'm all too aware of the Orwellian overtones of such an act.	s
Interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve.	s
Wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question: what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary.	s
The tragedy is, of course, that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now, mostly due to studio constraints around "Dreamcatcher."	s
A very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right, and saw the other as being in the wrong.	s
As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass.	s
The viewer is swept away from modern life into old Japan, while at the same time exposed to very current themes.	s
Also, the ending is disappointing.	s
So to make a long story short I give this cool MACROSS knock-off 7 STARS.	s
This film is a movie goers film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end.	s
Should he take his claim as the king of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name?	s
On this sitcom, he played Paul Hennessey, a loving, yet rational dad, who laid down the ground rules for his three children.	s
magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs!	s
As though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show.	s
As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas.	s
We are accustomed to brief scenes in Denis's film which are inexplicable: Nénette astride Boni feeding with a spoon; a drive by shooting of Boni's father and then the briefest of images of Boni with a gunshot wound in the head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney.	s
Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with.	s
However, the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters.	s
Why?	s
On the whole this is a really good movie.	s
If I didn't know that the animation was this style, I would swear that is was traditional pen and ink.	s
His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker, who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series.	s
The story is very well crafted and almost brilliant.	s
There are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming.	s
The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and I just lost it, and laughed my head off.	s
As for this 1987 made for TV movie, it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series.	s
I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD.	s
The crisp display of later Tarzan films is lacking here.	s
Definitely dated now, but at the time The Groove Tube was irreverent, bold, shameless and hysterically funny.	s
The filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem.	s
But then he is in trouble deep, deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know.	s
When I was old enough I rented all of these movies out.	s

It was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that Tom had left behind.	s

There I also the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did, and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe and a change of assignment.	s
but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those "nothing to do days".	s
The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie.	s
While at first disappointed, this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime -- a hugely successful film, and a job he excels at.	s
why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand.	s
THE SHOW OF SHOWS is pretty gigantic.	s
I love the connection between the characters.	s
Lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends.	s
The sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs.	s
She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn (the ship's barber).	s
Brown was born in 1931, one of the thirteen children of a working-class Dublin family.	s
The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing.	s
I saw it at the Boston film festival, and I found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else, and also moved by some of the movie's more serious parts.	s
Only in Hollywood.	s
Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that.	s
Jeremy Northam is perfectly cast and the adorable Lucy Liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side.	s
Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey, where as in Excellent Adventure they look rather like, well as they would put it, FAGS!!!	s
All in all, this was a decent watch & I would watch it again.	s
Brokedown Palace is truly a one of a kind.	s
You will laugh nonstop if you have any sense of humor at all.	s
The initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again, just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiece.	s
Its class structure, manners, idiom, dress, architecture, and, yes, peculiar driving habits give Woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire.	s
rescuing Molly, and the end).	s
I thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores.	s
If a guy takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a cable listing] to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks.	s
We can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film, but still helped make it great.	s
What appears today seems rather tame by current standards.	s
It is not only believable, it happens every day.	s
The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end.	s
The embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us, "Does anybody know what a dilly dick is?"	s
You settle down with a bar of ice cream.	s
The cinema-photography is excellent, in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers.	s
But who's complaining?	s
It made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous, I had to laugh.	s
Is he right?	s
Allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesn't realize how much danger she really is and it's all Erroll's fault.	s
She is wounded, she needs a rest, but police almost catch them.	s
And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in a wrong wayand that makes her crazy, literally.	s
Another odd point about "Return".	s
Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending!	s
It has become part of our family "culture," and we quote the characters often.	s
The ominous bartender is run over by a car, perhaps accidentally, so he's out of the picture.	s
In this movie characters can DIE, and be sent to HELL!	s
An event has occurred at her school; a shooting.	s
As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role.	s
i love it!	s
Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls.	s
This way Dressed to Kill is quite absorbing & engaging, unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable.	s
Scanners II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's sci-fi classic Scanners and should be seen.	s
We should not forget that this movie is not a documentary.	s
A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a terrific supporting cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns.	s
Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises as a drug-addled actress shooting in Paris and meeting with her dealer.	s
This movie could not have been made under the code.	s
It's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines (all from Allen of course).	s
This role is the type of role you don't normally see Drew play.	s
However, I can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in translation to the big screen.	s
I'm addicted to this film.	s
Coe was no suicide; this was murder.	s
The world of Renaissance is remarkable.	s
Moreover, the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told.	s
And that goes especially for lawyers & cops.	s
And make sure no one under 10 is in the room.	s
He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money.	s
Some people may call them kitschy, but I will never give up admiring these films.	s
It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films.	s
William is a great actor -- I feel he never got his due.	s
This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic.	s
Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories.	s
Just watched this movie on DVD and thought the acting was very good, but the over all story left a lot to be desired.	s
Remember what you see and save the analysis for later.	s
This is a film in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen.	s
Later, Louis is greeted(not so politely) by Church.	s
It's got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando (and, contrary to Sinatra's original wishes, the casting works), it's got a really cool 1950s feel, even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption.	s
Nicolas Cage's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety, surprise or uncertainty and J T Walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who's always concealing more than he's actually saying.	s
The Catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist/explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films.	s
If you don't crack up when Candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while being hand-cuffed to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door separating them (huh?, see the movie!	s
IMHO, it looks like director/writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this indeed is his first report card, I'd give him an "A".	s
This is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately.	s
In Full House, John Stamos does a great job portraying his character.	s
As an expatriated french, I particularly enjoyed this "TV" movie, which I think deserves a broader distribution.	s
Take a closer look at the movie, and then maybe you will understand what I am talking about.	s
I got most of the jokes (at least I think I did).	s
They'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place.	s
The picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion, and although some plot points go unexplained, I was left feeling more than satisfied.	s
And salute to Yasmin.	s
But when I was looking around in Netflix, they were advertising this like crazy if I liked "goofy" scary movies, so I figured to just give it a shot.	s
BASTILLE - a truly wonderful sequence.	s
Sid eventually teams up with Manny, and they became friends.	s
You have to give them credit.	s
In 2007 how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office.	s
The choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic.	s
Shortly afterward, he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood.	s
The scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular... on the big screen, that is... on a TV... it just looks average.	s
Furthermore Johnnie To succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts.	s
After the hit, the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast, but in trying to arrest him, several police officers and civilians are killed.	s
I can not say enough nice things about The Big Bad Swim.	s
Never viewed this film until recently on TCM and found this story concerning Poland and a small town which had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other European Cities for example: Norway.	s
It put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together(not to mentioned, try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father).	s
I love cinema so what I'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply.	s
The score is also uplifting and dramatic.	s
Again Stacy Peralta is true first to the people who lived the story.	s
Such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he's ever worked for.	s
Not recommended for intellectual movie lovers.	s
She goes to pieces.	s
As a Brit I was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on.	s
It was neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if this was intentional.	s
The cat catches the fish, drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy, not knowing what has happened, gets back.	s
Whatever one further may say about 'Loulou', it's beyond doubt that this very French film stands out for its excellent acting.	s
The three children are the artistic JJ, the moody Thelma and the young intellectual child Michael.	s
Just keep your fingers crossed!	s
Steven (Campbell Scott) is my all time favorite.	s
If you can find this movie, rent it!	s
Her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen.	s
Always.	s
They were expecting something akin to Star Wars, and it was not that.	s
However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre experiences.	s
Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired.	s
His flat belly days long gone.	s
She remarked to the effect that the band shouldn't talk to him like that.	s
I guess I'll start with the plot.	s
As the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes she's doomed, Henry picks up his instrument and "fans" it over her.	s
It seemed to come off.	s
Though he may not have invented the technique, Griffith was crucial in popularising the use of "cross-cutting"  that is, alternating between different events occurring at the same time.	s
German expatriate director Wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio-bound swamp set.	s
They had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court.	s

And guys, I think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie.	s
Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor.	s
Astaire and Scott are two Navy men.	s
And little bit more.	s
The love story, their intimate connection, is very much between Alexandre and Natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both.	s
Celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the DR's office sequence with her & two other ladies is just incredible.	s
It's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.	s
It's a lighthearted romp whenever Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days.	s
Music also plays a great part in this film, especially the title song "Reign Over Me," or "Love, Reign O'er Me" by The Who, and later covered by Pearl Jam.	s
There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however, like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things (I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks).	s
Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.	s
We've all heard or read about it in some kind of con-text.	s
Alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend.	s
Indeed, but there's a greater purpose to all of this.	s
Is it a supernatural comedy?	s
Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness.	s
That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless.	s
Only the ending is strange (you don't see what happens with the Pegasus).	s
There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast, Moon Over Harlem, Body and Soul, Paradise In Harlem, Keep Punching, Sunday Sinners, Dark Manhattan, Broken Strings, Boy!	s
The ship itself, the NX-01 is somewhat questionable in design.	s
It's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain tile, because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast, you don't get an idea of what to expect.	s
A fabulous film.	s
Pacing of each film was good, and overall structure, though a bit long (they left out two of what was to be 20 films, but said all would be on the DVD) seemed to vary between tones of the films to keep a good balance.	s
I love this movie like no other.	s
There are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films.	s
The stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.	s
I'm quite a cynic.	s
This one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars!	s
The acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film--in fact, I almost scored the film a 6--it was really close.	s
In Iran, women are not admitted to soccer games.	s
himself.	s
It looks as if Samhain's production was jinxed right from the start.	s
This beautiful story of an elder son coming home, and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from, is poignant and moving.	s
It is about desires, human desires I think everyone can understand.	s
So, what's all this melodrama really about it?	s
i would be so so excited!!	s
Like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let's set the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, they can't cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to.	s
This is a great film, so don't be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic.	s
It's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie.	s
Once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage.	s
He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way.	s
A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy.	s
Girlfight feels is both realistic and involving, that is enough so to make it a memorable film.	s
The two main characters work beautifully together.	s
It is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart.	s
My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.	s
So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.	s
I thoroughly enjoyed this film overall, but four things really stand out: Sam Raimi's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy(?	s
What a wonderful, wonderful story.	s
Once able to read, he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan, a car, and a house, taking his place at the head of the family, the breadwinner.	s
The relationship goes nothing but excellent, until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy.	s
Maybe it's just me, but I don't think so.	s
Even though this is his ideal, in the fantasy we get from Ratso's perspective, it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society.	s
Desperate for help she accepts his suggestion.	s
As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console.	s
This movie is a MUST SEE !!!	s
It starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine!	s
I realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets, but things were changing - Carousel, for example, made great use of location photography.	s
Only thing it needed more of was Dana Delany, what a babe!	s
At the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict.	s
Matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.	s
They also did have a daughter Gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007).	s
Some of the back story on this production is fascinating.	s
No movie provides more sheer entertainment.	s
I collect Horror films from all over and I have seen the good and the very bad - Zombie Bloodbath is a low budget video.	s
Anyone who has been in Japan would understand.	s
It's a good show, and I find it funny.	s
Irène Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked, manipulate villain Iago.	s
There's a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film, and although The Drews have milked that scene completely it's still fun to watch.	s
Through the night.	s
Unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem Romans with bubble-helmets: if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s, Well's vision of a rationalistic society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it.	s
What I thought was good about the character in the movie, is that he stayed in character throughout.	s
If only the dratted writers had managed to remember Saruman's name--he's frequently referred to as Aruman, a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly-named Sauron; it took me a second viewing before I was certain I hadn't misheard it.	s
At first, the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected.	s
Although Damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of Bourne.	s
As the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save Sullivan's life (he is trapped under a pier, and the tide is rising), Ralph Meeker is more energetic than usual.	s
In its way, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever.	s
I know it's something we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special.	s
Aside from the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as filler.	s
This is the Who at their most powerful.	s
He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him.	s
This is the first filmed version of 'Hamlet' to use the full text of Shakespeare's play, but Branagh didn't do it just because "it was there."	s
Did this film live up to my expectations?	s
I have read these reviews on here a few times.	s
The walls don't turn to rubber and grow hands.	s
It's also the only film she made with Astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition.	s
Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief.	s
The artist's inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination, and enables him escape his prison, whether it be literal or in his mind, and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand.	s
I mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like "the camera is in front of them".	s
Of course.	s
The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area.	s
Other than that, the movie rolls along more or less well, with little jumps in continuity here and there -- something quite common in films from this era -- and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents.	s
It looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it!	s
I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film.	s
From Margotta, on the other hand, there is a vibrant, twisted force in his performance, and as he descends it's frightening, but perhaps understandable from the times (and what a climax).	s
Sydney Lumet, in this performance at the age of 82 (!	s
It was, and is, an excellent example also of self-referential cinema.	s
Those same flaws, however, are not reflected in the visuals - Renaissance is nowt short of stunning.	s
Excellent.	s
The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while.	s
You support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death.	s
The front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess.	s
So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD.	s
No, I don't mean great setting of characters and plots, but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic.	s
Some of his co-workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that Andy, is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity.	s
I've seen only bits & pieces of her TV performances, but her cameo role in Ghoultown's recent tribute song "Mistress of the Dark" really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff.	s
Girls on beaches, under shower, in low-light rooms, in gardens, under tents, in front of mirrors, regardless of the amount of clothes - this is his territory, he can shoot minutes and hours, and whatever he does you'll always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it.	s
For those who are unfamiliar, here's the Robo-scoop: We're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust, large scale "wars" have been outlawed.	s
Since it has been some years since I reviewed this classic I have decided to go back and review it more in dept, but first some insider notes from a movie critic.	s
This is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside Cushing's mind.	s
It creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other.	s
I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this #4.	s
The writing was pretty good also.	s
An amazing read!	s
Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2) I was glad that Disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation.	s
But he wants them to start touring again first.	s
It also contains many memorable supporting characters including Roger the surly orangutan, Vincent the Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the faux patriotic Snout Brothers and Chutney the elephant.	s
If the Australian Post Office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is it.This is one of those movies who's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again.	s
Yet, over the years, I had forgotten of its existence.	s
This is a slow, moody, but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family.	s
TARZAN AND HIS MATE was a triumph (although it would be drastically edited for many years), and remains THE classic of the series, to this day!	s
The story begins just as Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired because the collapse of the economy.	s
The military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy.	s

I had an urge to see the caped crusader.	s
He plays Christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned Christy who struggles to cope with why he can't find non-platonic love.	s
Yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for Esther, her face and body remain torpidly somnolent, impassive, dispassionate.	s
Would someone please put this out on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.	s
Police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when she plainly isn't.	s
The best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first Matrix film.	s
I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists.	s
That brings us -- by no particular course that I'm aware of -- to Marushka Detmars.	s
It shows us that real life and "ficticious" action can produce a winning combination.	s
Not everything is said in this excellent first feature from Céline Sciamma.	s
Mr. Destiny, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart.	s
The look follows closely the fashions of the times.	s
Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us.	s
In this regard alone, a debt of gratitude is owed Mary Harron.	s
Musically it's a mixed bag.	s
VITAL severe MASTERPIECE!	s
I have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts, Blair Witch Project was one of them, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot.	s
The plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in Florida, but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman, and when he realizes that he was seen, well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff.	s
I don't recall another film, certainly not American, that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner, much like the "nose" of a fine Bordeaux.	s
But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles.	s
Everything works out fine.	s
Much in the same way Frank Miller and his Sin City comics used black and white to express itself (and its film noir influences), so does Christian Volckman with Renaissance.	s
Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis.	s
That is not all: So many beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and on the set back in 1952!	s
The realism and subtle nuances, offered to Ashley Judd's character, Ruby, by the storyline, capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of Florida.	s
The film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'.	s
I was adopted at birth and certainly did NOT have the problems Antwone fisher had in the movie, but I still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to deal with them.	s
The job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like "E.T."	s
I would like to have an update.	s
already the viewer sees the text and the drama of Shakespeare getting a hold of "Tony" and off he goes on his journey of doom.	s
The filming and acting were very good, and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable.	s
He was a brave man.'	s
The score, art direction, and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film.	s
The euro is not hard to figure out, make the gringo audiences do the math.	s
Underrated.	s
I think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into Spark's story.	s
Following three high school girls in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years, it does what all good art should: it discovers the universal in the particular.	s
But on the whole, the American style banter makes the American characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.	s
The fact that director Fatih Akin's moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy.	s
It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive, And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing.	s
When he joins a church choir as its cantor, he brings about a transformation in the lives of the choristers , just as Jesus did to the society in first century Palestine.	s
Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director.	s
It was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye.	s
Moreover, it can make us believe that the war has not finished, yet; at least for some of us.	s
We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal.	s
Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie.	s
The cinematography and editing are understated but inspired, enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close-ups and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways.	s
This movie's about Simon's adventures.	s
We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it feels patronizing.	s
To get the true story of the Beales, I had to wade through all of the DVD's bonus material and commentaries and search the web.	s
This is a different film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors who help this picture TOGETHER!	s
This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways: more characters and more complexity.	s
A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer.	s
I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do.	s
Pinjar is truly a masterpiece... .	s
This is an extremely dense, somber, and complicated film that unravels quite slowly, revealing excruciating detail, like the attention paid in a novel, and watching this film "IS" like watching a novel unfold.	s
The surprise nominee of this year's Best Animated Feature race at the Oscars.	s
We then go to present day, first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re-opening the old prison.	s

Din!	s
To emphasize the point there is a dog, and Pegg rounds that off in true Brit style comedy, with a great little twist.	s
All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare.	s
TV Soap Actors.	s
Ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role.	s
He is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : Either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead OR you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you".	s
A few will stay just to see "how bad it will get" and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.	s

This show is good.	s
Brad Pitt, and his acting performance in this film was, to say the least, remarkable!!!..	s
The end almost had me falling out of my chair because I was laughing so hard!	s
I am really happy that I saw this movie.	s
Unconvinced the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination.	s
To say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too, 'cause there's never been a far-from-great Sopranos episode so far.	s
Papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm ... Download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them.	s
I first saw this right after I saw the series finale of Battlestar Galactica ( Being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything I could of the shows universe )so I didn't know what to expect...but I did come out with a smile though I must admit...	s
A theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (March, 2005) but this never happened.	s
The music, camera shots, and acting are excellent.	s
A rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story.	s
Kids under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed kids) should not watch this.	s
In August of 1979 the show came to an end,with all leaving the projects for a better life.	s
Charming in every way, this film is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good.	s
Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river.	s
Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard-bitten roles, and she is in top form here.	s
Highly recommended.	s
when Danny( Joe Piscopo) pulls up to the d.a's office & parks in a disabled spot, Danny's partner says  " can't park here, it's for the handicapped".	s
And, it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery.	s
Sinatra who had done some vocal cameos in previous films, takes a leaf from the page of his singing rival Bing Crosby.	s
Some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but I think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story, for it really is an incredible one.	s
The title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum.	s
A few really great clips make up for this.	s
With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa	s
Sequels usually make me nervous, however this one did pretty well for itself.	s
Allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome.	s
So, watch it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!	s
Here ends my rant!	s
The quintessential road movie...if your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani.	s
All in all, this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven't seen it see it, because what the critics and box office say doesn't always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you might just enjoy it.	s
The power to dream is a wonderful thing.	s
In Season 1, Mark Twain appears, and he is depicted as a middle-aged man.	s
It does, however, capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other, beloved works.	s
But sometimes, a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work.	s
This movie is not primarily about the act of "riding giants," but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the emphasis.	s
Then she seeks revenge...and the rest you better see it from the movie.	s
This film is one memorable scene after another.	s
Check it out cause I have loved it since it came out.	s
With the title of "La Maman et la putain", I deduce Jean Eustache was relating to Françoise Lebrun's character of Veronika.	s
It must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment.	s
If this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is.	s
Perfect.	s
Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids.	s
its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie, and it gets old telling people it's rap's version of spinal tap.	s
The director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music.	s
It looks wonderful with great period detail (30's).	s
Last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget.	s
SPOILERS In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people".	s
How the police work with the political party being what it was...	s
The cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters.	s
I can watch it over and over.	s
I could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while I'd rather go to the Dentist than watch "Chicago" again.	s
The director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand.	s
object to the movie being too preachy about Germany in WWII.	s
After a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.	s
Confusing enough?	s
Also playing interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar.	s
Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world.	s
Oh well.	s
Great to watch late at night!	s
Watch "Pet Sematary" to witness one of the most touching, emotional Horror movies of recent times.	s
I loved the effect used at the end (and a little bit at the beginning) of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie.	s
That knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to Farnsworth.	s
If you like film noir, this is a must-see.	s
I particularly liked McShane's short but effective turns.	s
This is a great film, particularly for those who've dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past, who will relate to many moments in the film.	s
This movie reunites some of the best directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen , Walter Salles a...(read more)nd Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories about love located in Paris, each one with their particular way of directing.	s
to which Lionel replied "And I am nothing of the kind, sir!"	s
And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&w.	s
So in summary, I'd recommend checking it out for a little Friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!)	s
Carla helps Paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why Paul missed his appointment.	s
It's a shame the DVD isn't so great.	s
I've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail.	s
Though I do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades.	s
Looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret.	s
If you maybe meditate on it deeply enough, you might even re-evaluate the power of storytelling, and the age-old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced.	s
Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time.	s
Somewhere, in a confuse manner, a problem remains unsolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today, because this death, this unique vanishing life I lived it, I shared with my child unconditional friendship.	s
Cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks!	s
I won't spoil what happens.	s
But that's life; that's the treachery of growing up, in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself.	s
While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for Ann's children currently, I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have.	s
Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat?	s
The actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle, but in the end, the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to uphold their own starvation, does nothing to help the children's situations.	s
Highly recommended.	s
Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack!	s
The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America.	s
The plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife.	s
This version appears to be what Avco was going to release back in '73.	s
I can't really express how good I thought it was, so I won't try, I'll just say, if you get the opportunity, PLEASE SEE IT!!!!	s
The Characters don't talk much, there are no long and boring conversations of this and that (like in Ghost in the Shell).With its dark pictures, views of strange beasts and sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient Scandinavian stories, full of violence and horrendous creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, dwelled by dragons, throlls, orks...and one mysterious hero to stop evil...	s
It's playing on Azteca America right now, which is only available in Mexico or in the US by paid cable.	s
I was but a babe in arms when George Lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young Luke Skywalker and the notorious Darth Vadar but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is Lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with.	s
At least a Dozen.	s
Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed.	s
I muttered under my breath.	s
If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record!	s
Fate?	s
Here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in Paris.	s
Some thirty years ago, Author Numa Sadoul published a book length interview with the Belgian comic book artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin).	s
One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it doesn't really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey.	s
Every effort to film Shakespeare ought really to be celebrated.	s
I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far.	s
Here's a rare gem for those of you that haven't seen or most likely not even heard of this.	s
Of course he has achieved it.	s
Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters.	s
Limited playing time(with limited budget) and a lot of missing scenes.	s
It seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land, until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage.	s
The puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well.	s
He apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time, so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career.	s
It's frightening, in fact, to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth.	s
Be satisfied.	s
That has been updated in recent years to "If you think you have problems, watch a TV talk show...especially Jerry Springer's!"	s
The artistry of this movie "As it is in Heaven" magnificently displayed the unfolding of life,not only its joy & sadness,but ultimately the hope of life.	s
Not knowing what this film was about, I checked it out at the video store and after seeing it, I enjoyed it.	s
With both of these actors no longer with us, the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious.	s
this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions,muti-billion dollar computer graphics,or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie, All you need is a excellent story line and plot.	s
As I understand it from the commentary and things I have read, it was made during the huge Midwest flood of 1993 when half of Missouri was underwater.	s
Then there are all those Austen sequels churned out by modern writers).	s
The interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate.	s
Very somber score by Ben Cheung, with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film.	s
My advice would be to not even watch a trailer, just rent the film and watch without expectations.	s
I really thought that this movie was superb.	s
Purple Rain not only broke boundaries, it set a decade, the costumes, the music, the behavior, and the dancing!	s
Just picked this up on DVD and watched it again.	s
C.G.	s
I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role.	s
What is most unsettling about the film is that it's not really about a hero or a villain at all, but an inanimate piece of weoponry that drives the action.	s
The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to do a double switch on the Borg was great.	s
And wouldn't you know that, it being a Universal-International film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both quite unknown at the time) have bit roles.	s
The late, great actor Pavle Vujisic (Muzamer from When Father >was Away on Business) was memorable as the bus driver of >the ill-fated trip in his typical gruff yet loveable manner.	s
The film, even with its faults, will not disappoint.	s
And I think you know that.	s

So, when Gabe is about ready to be sent back to "The Big House", it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks.	s
And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible Director, and NEEDS to be apart of some kind a Project...But no, they'll(Like most of the Marvel projects) just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about, and keep churning out these gamble movies.	s
I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it.	s
Seidl´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with Fassbinder; like this German ally, he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films.	s
It's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what.	s
Directed by Wes Craven and with stars as Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is just ordinary, not original at all.	s
I hate when a film (spescially a carton)can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end, even if it sounds weird (Im not a bitter person).But this was OK, he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way.	s
Suddenly Karen telephones.	s

Some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature, but then again, that's basically what most of the Matrix series has done, and it's been a driving force behind its success.	s
Most of their "businesses" there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you.	s
In the first chapters, we see some shots of the Vietnam war, in between the scenes.	s
The rest is history.	s
With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'.	s
This was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned.	s
Well, I never really liked those halflings anyway.	s
It was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to!	s
A draw with Blazing Saddles (1974) for uproarious apoplexy value, although otherwise dissimilar.	s
In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cries out to God for some help.	s
There's also some great F/X, a very surreal dream sequence, and a fairly original plot.	s

The fight is over, but the scars will always be there.	s
If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies.	s
Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained.	s

If you like classic Kung Fu films you don't want to miss this one!	s
I suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set.	s
The frame is always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye.	s
In conclusion, if you are a die-hard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or like biopics, I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters.	s
Not only to a filmmaker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as audience, who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time.	s
How rare is that?	s
Content wise, the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion.	s

In such a runaway from authorities and Mafia he meets a girl (acted by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her.	s
The curious thing about this production by A&E Television Networks, with script by the ever-reliable Andrew Davies, is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions, one starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Clueless", a "modernized" version, starring Alicia Silverstone, which transported the plot to Beverly Hills.	s
The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke.	s
Felecia and Stephanie Swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned.	s
How each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch.	s
Everybody talk about BJM, but he does not take part in the discussion.	s

Deanna Durbin, then 14 and just under contract to MGM, made a short feature in 1936 which paired her with Judy Garland, a year younger, in the first film for both of them.	s
It was quite obvious that Burke isn't that young.	s
This is one of those unique children's films like Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz that completely transcends 'family entertainment' status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms.	s
If Lars van Trier has put Denmark on the offbeat-oddball Dogma Cinematic map in recent years, there is now a good chance that Veteran Maverick Erik Clausen (62) and his capable crew of actors will soon show the world that Denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel, which is to say, a mass audience pleaser for young and old alike.	s
The world of the Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity challenged world.	s
Prostitute Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape.	s

This is truly a wonderful movie.	s
Maybe I shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe I should.	s
Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution.	s
I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids).	s
Ian Holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and Holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes.	s
I'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece - his triumph.	s
Definitely worth picking up for pocket change on DVD.	s
I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do.	s
Don't invite the kids, though.	s
This was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator!	s
Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome).	s
Hence the movie is not only about Madhavi, but also equally about Deepak Suri(Boman Irani)- Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery, Anjali Thapar(Soni Razdan)- a socialite suffocating from the social pollution, Abhijeet(Rehan Engineer)- a homosexual make-up artist and Madhavi's roommates Pearl(Sandhya Mridul)- the sassy airhostess and Gayatri(Tara Sharma)-an aspiring actress.	s
Lest I forget there are women in this film, and true to the Japrisot method, they too are memorable, though not nearly as fleshed out; to say much more would be to spoil one's delight in discovering their true nature.	s
Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky who rents an apartment in France.The previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt.He goes to see her there where he also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), the friend of Simone.He and Stella become pretty close.Later Simone dies.Trelkovsky begins to think the landlord and the neighbors are trying to change him into Simone so that eventually he would also jump out of the window.Le Locataire (The Tenant) from 1976 is the last film of Polanski's apartment trilogy.The previous ones were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.Roman Polanski does not do good job only as the director but his acting is also superb.Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful.The landlord, Monsieur Zy is played by the great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz.The fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge.The Tenant is something very scary from time to time.It gives a lot of that psychological scare.This film is not the easiest one to understand or explain but that makes it all so fascinating.	s
For the people remembering the original Cube Production Commentary on its DVD may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with the story of Cube.	s
And since I saw GARDE A VUE, I always mention this film as one of the "defenders" of French cinema against accusations of mess and chaos.	s
And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I have hated him so.	s
And though Christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it, we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life.	s
Get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory.	s
Whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, I would not know.	s
I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for Sharon Stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy.	s
Appearing quite late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor.	s
The whole climax, with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above, is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail-biting denouements I ever witnessed.	s
The wind blows your eyes far away."	s
Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought onto the screen here.	s
Except for losing a leg in a battle against the French in 1838, he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars.	s
They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother's safety.	s
I know that this was a very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna were just so cool and Steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work.	s
A light-hearted comedy, Nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to: a world of nothing.	s

Soderbergh looks firmly at Che's inflexible dedication.	s
I just came back from The 40 Year-Old Virgin and I can honestly say, it was one of the biggest laughs of my life.	s
I would reccomend this film to everyone.	s
I have watched it over and over again.	s
Dench, Dukakis, and Laine, now there are some REAL women!	s
I thought this was an awesome movie.	s
Bozz is an ultra-cool, not to be intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war.	s
Since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939, it has obvious flaws.	s
If you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here, (and some real tossers).	s
Along the journey he encounters scumbags who take advantage of other human suffering and desperation.	s
The Sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago, by my father, and i've seen it many times since.	s
You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he didn't had to see, and well, almost all his family gets killed for that "wrong thing" his son did.	s
The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well.	s
The pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments.	s
The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome!	s
Ho, ho, homicidal maniac!	s
It's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience I've ever had -- despite the crude cinematography and plot, and mild over-acting (though I like the cast -- they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs).	s
Whatever she's done, she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of sympathy jarring.	s
This is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come.	s
Watch one of the brightest ones of the summer right now.	s
It may be because by the time he was getting leads, he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinée idol; or it could be he lacked that certain something; or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like Greer Garson.	s
Eleanor Parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination.	s
Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah.	s
I started to see the angel... and I started to like her.	s
Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress.	s
She's still here, damn it, even after the release of Without You I'm Nothing, some 15 years ago.	s
I don't have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch them four seasons.	s
The film is a metaphor over life.	s
That wasn't too great.	s
I watched it 3 times in a row!	s
There are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief... three of them, no less.	s
Four words account for why this film was made - "She Done Him Wrong".	s

Capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever.	s
Even sadder, Taylor appears to realise this, evinced by his weary, self-loathing voice-over: he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost?	s

A cheap hustler who wants to get the big score.	s
Where the film is let down is miss-using a fairly decent budget.	s

Andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there.	s
I think that is better too.	s
The long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and 'wait- in-line' feeling the characters must endure.	s
If you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.	s
I also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch, making the show all that more fun to watch.	s
The dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures Christmas miracles.	s
The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date.	s

I could find no technical faults.	s
Which is not exactly a bad thing, seeing how Tachiguishi is so dialogue-heavy.	s
In the case of "In Cold Blood" it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant, intellectually elevating, and, of course, it goes without saying, "In Cold Blood" was utterly spellbinding, as well as a totally remarkable movie!	s
But this does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever."	s
In second part one can find great songs - Russian romances.	s
The plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings, his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath Manhattan apartment.	s
I have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for.	s
The standout acting comes from Maggie Cheung as Jackies' suffering girlfriend and Bill Tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief.	s
Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him.	s
Watched it many times since, and my opinion has mellowed a bit.	s
As proof of my obsessiveness, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice.	s
That's my two cents.	s
Wouldn't let her cook for them, though...	s
His balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters, because these are the ones Sirk is interested in too.	s
I had missed the opening credits,so I didn't know the name of it but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it,so I naturally thought I had tuned into "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot,I was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night.	s
I was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters.	s
As a 'Louise Brooks movie' it was not at all what I was expecting, either from her Hollywood comedies or from G.W.Pabst's German melodramas: I found the idiom more fluent and enjoyable than either, and Brooks herself is a different creature, a sturdy laughing young animal rather than a shop-window vamp or manipulated doll.	s
This is the real package A kung fu movie that delivers on every level.	s
As demonstrated in Lost in Translation, Johansson has a talent for comedy, and the querulous by-play between her and Allen is very amusing - and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance.	s
And the story has a happy end, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children.	s
Some of the acting was a bit suspect.	s
The title sequence was cute but not up there with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther.	s
Here, the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker.	s
He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in.	s
This is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible.	s
The story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle-class house.	s
The acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person.	s
Here, Hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals.	s
She is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an Ogre living in her basement.	s
Awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herge's dreams.	s
The other common trait of these movies is the caring, thoughtful `guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity.	s
Ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters.	s
it was thrilling and was a brilliant insight to what actually happened to Steve Biko during the time of the Apartheid law.	s
But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance.	s
Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious Dumb-And-Dumber sort of way the TV series never achieved.	s
This is a well directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'.	s
Some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me.	s
Both sisters are quite different from each other.	s
Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.	s
My own tornado landed me in my own State's Science Fair, in Physics by '62, though our group was less successful in gaining the support of, for example, firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event, our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore.	s
While the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end, it works.	s
Yet, this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness, with another of Kirk's past acquaintances.	s
Ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.	s
I can safely say as many impersonators as there are there was only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel came extremely close to being the real thing.	s
I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance.	s
The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested.	s
You can see many actors and actresses, who became famous, in the beginning of career.	s
Afterward, I was shocked to read the user-comments here.	s
My favorite character was Tom, Edward's insane boss.	s
Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script, or it may have been altered by someone else.	s
Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and Gary Stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece.	s
Most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt!	s
Well she is.	s
This is an almost action-less film following Jack, an insomniac, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself off a building, and, for a lot of the time, can't tell reality from hallucination.	s
He is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge.	s
Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection.	s
As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.	s
I am currently wanting to see if I can re-make it on my own; if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a TON of imitation =)	s
The acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived.	s
Some other critics, perhaps more appropriately, saw "Ossessione" as the Italian counterpart to the "poetic realism" of French cinema (remember Visconti had been Renoir's assistant), especially Marcel Carné's "Quai des Brumes" and "Le Jour se Lève", and Julien Duvivier's "Pépé le Moko".	s
Pressing play to view the trailer I thought I was in for another hideous short from what so-far looked like another bad wannabe film-maker trying to bring new depth to an existing character.	s
Well no one!!!	s
For him, the film is a realistic, horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse.	s
Enter Sandra Locke's character, Jennifer Spencer, whom we soon learn after some (appropriately) mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel, unjust sexual assault (err, outright rape), and is sleekly, undercover-like, getting revenge.	s
Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!!	s
Due to some bad-luck, he is quickly identified by a roguish copy (who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit-man), and is quickly apprehended and captured.	s
No real suspense as such, just plenty of first class character development.	s
For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me.	s
Because of the true talent Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting cast had of demonstrating that whit, comedy, light-hearted humor, and deep thought could actually coexist.	s
Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of it way back when as 'that Neil Gaiman movie'.	s
The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by Moore.	s
The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest).	s
But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy.	s
The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies.	s
See it.	s
Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer's ailing young school teacher.	s
To tell Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess.	s
Alfred Hitchcock once said, "You can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off.	s
Unfortunately, the event of the second murder, necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of Franklin's (and ironically referred to as "sloppy" by Columbo in his climatic summing up) takes the steam out of the whole thing.	s
I happened upon this film by accident, and really enjoyed.	s
It doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.	s
Danny's daughters are named DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen).Joey and Jesse plan on moving in with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years; which is the number of years the show ran for.	s
That title, along with the opening scene, seem to create an image of a far more high-strung western type picture.	s
There's no need for that however!	s
Election was quite the award winner at last year's Hong Kong Film Awards, winning for best actor (Tony Leung), best picture, best director (Johnny To, who did Heroic Trio!!	s
I won't forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time, and for all the wrong reasons.	s
Example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus, and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes.	s
Further the costumes, if you're drawn to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well done.	s
This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.	s
A story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy.	s
And it was rather cleverly portrayed.	s
I am a very huge fan of Kris and see him in concert when I can.	s
There is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years.	s
I loved this movie.	s
It's just very poorly plotted and paced.	s
Then I got to see her movie, Jesus is Magic.	s
etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale.	s
It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years.	s
If you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop-culture society.	s
Even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is believable, and you find yourself cheering at the end!	s
I suppose you can call it by the slang word "artsy".	s
This movie deserves a very good ranking, if it was a Hollywood production it would be famous for sure.	s
The last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry 'The Majorettes', which is not necessarily a good thing.	s
And it is.	s
I was alone, never anything else, and never free, for I carried my chains within me, and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched".	s
All the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted.	s
They still have running jokes, clumsy hi-jinks, quick-change outfits in chase scenes, the standard hallway gag and even Scooby snacks.	s
Whatever good feelings, if that's possible, that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered Gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation, in order to keep from getting shot, he falsely implicate an innocent man Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime of informing on his friend Frankie McPhillip.	s
That being said, the character of Fay Grimm starts off in the film, exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended, but by the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative.	s
Moonwalker has everything !	s
A whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what God expects from his followers.	s
Direction and editing are often quite uninspired and TV-movie like, too.	s
Annoyingly, the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.	s
I can tell you just how bad this movie is.	s
It reminded me of Enemy Of The State.	s
No.	s
The movie really belongs to Abhay.	s
A fun film all the way.	s
Although the plot was a bit sappy at times, and VERY rushed at the end, as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story, overall it was pretty good for the Made-For-Backwoods-Cable-TV genre.	s
Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior, and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him.	s
Besides, I like these people.	s
A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.	s
Dickson, of Edison's staff, invented a motion-picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in February 1893.	s
As a final note, I am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans.	s
The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama.	s
Can a boring movie really be fascinating?	s
Despite this setback, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria.	s
If you loved Magnolia, another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes, you'll love Grand Canyon, too.	s
And to all the young people who may have not heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.	s
Second, the movie needed more research into Harilal's character.	s
I can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.	s
I admit I had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece.	s
I will also make a special mention to the clips from Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't).	s
It's worth it.	s
Dawson, in my opinion, manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to: drone-like existence in the waking hours, working some dead end job to survive (and distract) and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings.	s
This is a good quebeker movie with no much money and is also a magical movie because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful.	s
The animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great, and the story is good, but a little bit different from many other kids movies.	s
The scene where she records Evergreen ranks with the best in the business.. all live, no lip-sync, very special.	s
Before you can say "Hey, the filmmakers are obviously ripping off 'King Kong'," our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage, grabs the first luscious nubile blonde Euro vixen (the gorgeous Pheonix Grant) he lays lustful eyes on, and storms away with his new lady love.	s
Kyle's laugh is truly infecting, and offers a little eye-candy for the ladies as well (as does Matt).	s
It moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means.	s
It's not too difficult to read for those out there that don't read often so don't be afraid!	s
I like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice!	s
The game also allows players to go into "Bond reflex" mode.	s
You get to see a whole different side to Robert DeNiro in this movie!	s
I can't just choose one scene that stood out for me.	s
She prances around the house, always wearing a baboushka-like headdress around her head, completely covering her hair.	s
Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament.	s
This is a breakout role for Adam Sandler.	s
It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football.	s
They were a lot more believable, took themselves more seriously than modern heroines, and weren't corny.	s
The climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully; the denouement and ending is a speech by Cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned.	s
It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma.	s
Note too the stark shots of the prostrate Mildred towards the end of the film; they owe more to the early days of artistic film making than the sanitised, formulaic world of the studio that was about to dominate.	s
My 9 year old son loved this movie too.	s
Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society, you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk {some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague, though I think it's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff}.	s
I have two complaints.	s
Sequel?	s
Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter.	s
And where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult.	s
Here, all she has to do is scream "I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP!"	s
I was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in England.	s
Based on a story by Stuart Lake, the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the Winchester '73.	s
It's disturbing and distracting.	s
No mention of a rich background... And why doesn't Professor Phibbs have an office?	s
No extravagant props, no car chases, no clever one-liners.	s
fest offered by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers.	s
Of course, the original is better, but this isn't as bad as everyone says!	s
she screams "Uh...	s
The crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts.	s
I think that Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today, but a movie like this isn't just worth her time.	s
This movie is all round amazing!	s
It is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance.	s
I had found an article in Reader's Digest giving this actor/writer a clue to a terrific episode.	s
This is the first time I've seen Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and of Eric's; her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict.	s
Tenant is far more believable than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation that does the novel justice.	s
But it is fascinating to establish that Mats Helge eventually completes something which can be called an action movie.	s
I'm sure anyone who watches enough Canadian movies, especially late at night on the CBC, knows exactly what I'm talking about.	s
I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write.	s
If you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, don't miss it!	s
Wow!	s
Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make memorable early screen performances.	s
So why not just set it there and skip the third-grade report about Samhain/Irish immigrants/Halloween?	s
The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end.	s
The sequel takes place in London, where Catherine has now relocated.	s
It is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in 1950's Italy are adapted to 2002's USA.	s
We also don't see the villain(s) until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for us all.	s
But if, for some strange reason, your life ever depended on watching a Dudikoff film, this would be one of your best choices.	s
Definitely worth seeing and buying .....Added to my favorite movie list....it's number one now....	s
But, poor Parker.	s
Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.	s
The setting is similar to that in the Batman` movies, but not as dark and grey.	s
What was in Marishka mind?Well this add to the camp.It's unintentionally satirizing Queen Victoria'a story.	s
I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview.	s
The fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career.	s
Rosario, Chad, and Marcus should be commended for jobs well done.	s
The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in American movies as of late).	s
The scariness may have been diluted over the years (it WAS made in the mid-70s), but I was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show (via DVD) that I actually enjoy it MORE now for the latter reasons.	s
It was lengthy for one.	s
Hopper, Boyle, and Walsh are all fun to watch in these parts.	s
While attending her funeral, a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention.	s
Season #9 should be a thrill in itself.	s
Bear in mind, any film (let alone documentary) which asserts any kind of truth, will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism, from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless, those of you who are already Masters of psychology, film, and captains of the soul, will no doubt find this movie redundant, after all, you already know everything there is to know.	s
Get it?	s
The story is something that really keeps you watching.	s
Belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely, but was probably underused.	s
Despite this, he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely, is merely philosophical when Moe betrays his whereabouts and then later, he even ensures that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly.	s
There aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one.	s
However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean.	s
I have the impression that it never made it to it's deserved ranking (and never will), because of it's simplicity.	s
It is not a 'gangster film'.	s
Everybody can learn from Georges.	s
A story goes that he approached Griffith for work and D.W., knowing the reputation of his famous family, said "I am not hiring stage actors."	s
The ending was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry a little.	s
Although it doesn't belong in the same league with the inspirational James Stewart classic "The Stratton Story" (1949), "The Rookie" qualifies as the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore because audiences find them antiquated.	s
I have seen The Perfect Son about three times.	s
I would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's portrayal, whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states, the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith, some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part.	s
Add Burt Lancaster as the town sheriff, stir, and sit back.	s
While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" confusing, "Nothing" is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate.	s
That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison.	s
It shows how stifling ones culture can be, and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you.	s
Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl.	s
This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Dolph Lundgren, however Alex Karzis is awful as the villain!.	s
Watch and enjoy !!	s
My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby.	s
Comments about the dialogue seem off to me.	s
The second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending.	s
The characters were vivid and well-acted.	s
But even this isn't that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer.	s
It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody I've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy.	s
It does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ.	s
The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time.	s
As you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing, the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a Nazi yelling surprised or a warning in German, you truly feel like you are there, trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems.	s
Madonna was more express-less than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story.	s
The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling.	s
I've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time I still FELT it.	s
Such a purchase would increase the average.	s
The offhanded comments and burns from John were right on with his character(especially in the restaurant!	s
This is achieved in a subplot where the zoo-keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies.	s
The plot is interesting and twisty, the characters are cool each with their own style - toad, snake, lizard etc.	s
In self-referencing its own origins (the Star Trek episode" and and time traveling with a phone booth), B&T makes no attempt to hide its creators' love for homage.	s
A snapshot of ourselves at old age.	s
Despite looking interesting, I watched The Notorious Bettie Page because I had heard (and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film), that Gretchen Mol got naked in it.	s
And let me express how praise how well Silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches, in less time (not only in movie duration time, but in the single day that the movie develops its events) and in a smaller place, the kind of connection between two characters that Sofia Coppola generated in "Lost In Translation".	s
After I saw "La Roue" this afternoon, a short, light-hearted little movie, I consider this one a real treat!	s
It is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful.	s
Ewww!)	s
In fact, it contains no more songs than a regular musical.	s
He actually cries of happiness, and can barely express his emotion.....	s
It's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj.	s
Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite.	s
He's learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror - Val Lewton (original Cat People) and Robert Wise (a Val Lewton disciple and director of the Haunting and The Body Snatcher), Jacques Tournier (another Val Lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film, not the gross rubbish Raimi did (gross isn't scary, folks, it's just gross), and Lewis Allen (The Uninvited), and of course Jack Clayton's turn on Henry James The Innocents, and the way the master of suspense, Hitchcock, can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow-building and burning period piece like Under Capricorn.	s
Having said that, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch.	s
Not only does Denzel Washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, Steve Biko, but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid.	s
It has some bad acting.	s
A black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right, thus.	s
When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month.	s
If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over.	s
Columbo hunting down a detective/murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a Columbo movie.	s
Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer).	s
Is Anthony John Colman's greatest role, or even his signature role?	s
Here, Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her.	s
I won't go into the story because I think most people would rather have an opinion on the film, and too many "reviewers" spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere.	s
You know that this isn't just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves Kevin Kline being harassed by four black youths.	s
During another escapade, they encounter a new friend and his mute sister who become part of their band of friends.	s
Babbling constantly, sometimes at the same time, they hashed and re-hashed the past; going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda.	s
IT would be great to see something else from her in the same genre.	s
It's not the story that is the major attraction but the shrouded sets, lighting and the general moodiness of the piece.	s
From the opening credits, to the very end, it's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride, with some VERY explicit & graphic sexual content (hence the film's X rating in the U.S. in it's initial run,which is now unrated).	s
I was happy to see William Powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his Nick Charles character (from the "Thin Man" series).	s
A charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner.	s
Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations, remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness.	s
The movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter.	s
My husband doesn't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it.	s
Because of her chubbiness, boys don't seem interested and it pains her.	s
The night started off with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match.	s
I mean, nobody's surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones... but what would you think if it was otherwise?	s
Frailty is a non-gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion/obsession straight into depravity.	s
it all creates a really consistent world.	s
It won't happen again, Polanski's good-natured but slightly nervous tenant says, but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair.	s
And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented.	s
It feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish.	s
And before that it was The Land Before Time 1988.	s
It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song "Do Ajnabe" shows that very well.	s
Yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or have you been living under a rock) and times look bleak.	s
Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9.	s
His repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull.	s
However, very high commendations to the acting of Toby Stephens a perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves a superbly nasty and self-pitying villain.	s
With this cast, it's delightful.	s
I really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites.	s
This was a strong match.	s
With the help of his acquaintance Inspector Fernack who has come down from New York, they help a daughter of a crime boss.	s

The only thing that gets Moore aroused is a good battle.	s
They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more.	s

Here the major theme is class division.	s
However, he made other excellent films like DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely this one, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of queen Victoria.	s
You also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie.	s
Now for the film.	s
I could never decide on a favorite character then, and I still don't think I can!	s
Overall awesome flick, but not for everyone.	s
In an age when actresses careers are over by the time they're 30, most bands' second album is a greatest hits compilation, and music more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay, it's great to see real talent, real music and a really good movie come from, where else, the BBC.	s
Ben has devoted his life to the Sox, and does everything from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia.	s
The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation.	s
Yet last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself thoroughly enjoying the DVD sequel "The Naked Mile".	s
It was surely the highlight of my year--nay--my life.	s
Definitely worth watching, as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were.	s
Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that I'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime.	s
Few movies in the 1980's were as good as "Moonstruck"and it's funny too.	s
Connoisseurs of other Fassbinder films, however, will realize that "Lili Marleen" (1981) belongs to Fassbinder's "women movies" like "The Marriage of Maria Braun" (1979) and "Lola" (1981).	s
In old time movie theaters I would have stayed put for more showings.	s
It's not a great film, yet because there is little contrived about it, the story works.	s
They are active members of the Jackie Robinson Steppers, a real-life marching band whose rehearsals for a Labor Day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives.	s

I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations.	s
He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic.	s
Cuba and DeNiro's characters are very intricate and exciting to watch.	s
I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private.	s
We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth.	s
Renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings.	s
The small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world.	s
There is evidence showing that Goebbels was annoyed about having done this, and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free.	s
Beautifully acted and real situations.	s
Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other as Donna's parents, the chauvinistic but likable Bob and the airheaded Midge.	s
I suggest everyone watch this short.	s
And if your hating or criticising Lost you don't know how to watch t.v or watch drama.	s
Marvin J. McIntyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!.	s
From here on, better or worse, the series would also deal with one essential theme: a scientist (usually Bela) makes experiments in the basement or the old house (sometimes IN the basement in the old house) that causes things to go blooey.	s
Spock's acting here was excellent as Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner.	s
In Boy Meets Girl, when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt, when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel, when Alex enters a party an feels out of place, its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance; like the famous author who can't speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain, or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut.	s
The film strives for some honesty, and arrives at some truth, to maintain the film's integrity.	s
While Jackson version is better: -because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -Gollum/Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, even with it's well known shortcomings, is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfectly.	s
It was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation.. Basically, these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect...	s
It's not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame-type family film with sleeping-before-marriage considered "normal" behavior but considering it stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a lot rougher movie, at least language-wise.	s
Acting-wise, Astaire and Rogers are in typically zesty comic form here.	s
Naturally, he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect, a Communist, in 1984, a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag, supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo.	s
Gandhi My Father is a well made movie.	s
Whether it's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the English actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene.	s
Just note in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting the giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it.	s
The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.	s
Oh yeah, didnt you beat my husband up the other night, so let's get this lesson goin', to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one Bud and Sissy's many fights, which by the way all take place in public - in Gilley's !	s
That has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency, which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company.	s
It is too bad that no more are being made.	s
You're not going to get some spoon-fed narration or some Hollywood feel-good resolution.	s
By taking Vonnegut's "voice" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.	s
I have seen many movies that are about rape, but this one stands out.	s
The good guys use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top.	s
It has been some years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again.	s

I got very intrigued with how Natalie was going to interact with her daughter's friends , at first it seemed that she was going to spew a lot of animosity but once she started interacting more pleasantly i had to see how this visit was going to unfold.	s
Bad script, bad direction, over the top performances, overwrought dialogue.	s
Since then, movies like "My Left Foot" are a dime a dozen, so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about.	s
The series starts off with the episode A New Germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war.	s
Buttgereit's movies are generally difficult to categorize and Der Todesking is no exception.	s
Based on an actual mining disaster, this early German talkie (with English subtitles) still remains one of the most effective docu-dramas ever filmed.	s
I can quote this movie for hours on end.	s
There is a lot of criticism of this movie, in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented.	s
This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations, for example, Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie (1966)' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti!	s
Here, when the scripting is good but far from his own standards, he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for.	s
Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically.	s
Drug addiction and a desire for the sultry Jolie mix a heady cocktail.	s
Glenn Close is fantastic and really has made Cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is "cured" of her fur loving ways, she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater.	s
A+	s
Jones, R.G.	s
Much of the early portion of the film, that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations.	s
Enjoy.	s
The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in.	s

The Americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing.	s
As villified as the whites (particularly the Afrikaners) are portrayed in the film, any observant (non-casual) visitor to South Africa even now in 1999, not to mention 1977 when CRY FREEDOM takes place, will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained, even understated.	s
This can be told from May buying tea time snacks for Darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her, where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for.	s
The acting is good, the script is funny.	s
Fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist, played to excellent turn by Stephen Rea, in one of his strongest performances.	s
The songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing.	s

Watch this film on its merits, without preconceptions, allow yourself to be immersed in its story, and you will thoroughly enjoy it.	s
This moving story is one you'll enjoy reliving time and again.	s

I'm only sorry that I have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or DVD.	s
Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it.	s
Some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters.	s
Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey '60s.	s
Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "sublety."	s
Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, together with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation.	s
So if you have not seen this then you are need to asap.	s
When it's first discovered Andy is a virgin, at 40, his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman, which couldn't be any further from the truth.	s
This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life, and the inmates held within it.	s
The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place.	s
I was not disappointed.	s
She even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings.	s
Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch 'touch'.	s
I also like the 1950's era cars and motorcycles.	s
She tosses Tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face!	s
CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average on all counts, excepting dialogue which is rated as average.	s
The animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays.I have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity.I actually found it to be somewhat decent.The nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess.	s
Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role.	s
I thought this movie was LOL funny.	s
One of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives.	s
It broke numerous box-office records and inspired a 50% rise in police recruits, but, viewed 20 years on - is it any good?	s
Not because the two heroines weren't utterly adoring and helpless, not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions.	s
Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy.	s
This was one of those movies.	s
Jack Goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick.	s
The film was shot on location at Aulis.	s
Well, I guess we now know anything's possible in this case.	s
When he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride ( a beautifully leonine Lauren Bacall ) , Hadley goes off the deep end, escalating an already serious drinking problem with a "secret " gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb.	s
But all in all, it is an interesting movie, worth to watch it, far beyond the commercially movies, which are often more terrible.	s
Movie mavens will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father.	s
Prolific and highly influential filmmaker Martin Scorsese examines a selection of his favorite American films grouped according to three different types of directors: the director as an illusionist: D.W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward; the director as a smuggler: filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and mostly Vincente Minnelli, directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films; and the director as iconoclast: those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang-ups like Orson Welles, Erich von Stroheim, Charles Chaplin, Nicholas Ray, Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur Penn.	s
A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and it includes a manga video, showing the torture.	s
I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay.	s
This movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd, so absurd that becomes deep, and so unfunny that becomes hilarious.	s
All in all, I'd give it 3 out 4 stars.	s

While not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children.	s
George Fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes.	s
But she learned the Dewey Decimal system OVERNIGHT and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music??!!!!???	s
Somehow it is missing in this movie.	s
It is a drama about friendship and loyalty!	s
Eric Valette is obviously a talented film-maker, and so are the two guys who wrote the script.	s
So, in some respects, I owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever.	s
This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's greatest movie.	s
It's not a great movie either.	s
A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy, but it's an experience nevertheless.	s
But, every time I see it again I am amazed at all the great moments--particularly those involving the Grim Reaper.	s
This is the best movie!	s
In such an environment, of course, the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free-spirited enough to be out there in the first place (and so reject "society," at least as it manifested itself on the Eastern seaboard), and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just IS NOT RIGHT.	s
I sure didn't.	s
There are a few downsides, however, Nightwing is nowhere to be seen, and I'm sure Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne don't click as a couple, even though is just referenced, Tim Drake(aka Robin) does very little in the movie and to be quite frank, I was never a big fan of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Batman character design(especially in their Batman shows post-BTAS), this The New Adventures of Batman and Robin, well, it kinda makes Batman look fat then rather a well-built bulked up individual(kinda like the Jeff Matsuda character model from The Batman).	s
You know who's "the" intruder, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning.	s
Along the way, he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people.	s
He's the man in between, who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming.	s
I tried to buy the video for several years, finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business.	s
There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch.	s
Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged?	s
Brendan Filone is the best character.	s
Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston.	s
Oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera.	s
Forget Hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art!	s
Aside from the love story, I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film.	s
An unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know.	s
Said cloak has strange powers, which I dare not reveal here.	s
But of course it's a Christmas film, so why shouldn't everything look nice?	s
There aren't too many times when I see a film and go, "huh, what?	s
If you're just watching it randomly, you're in for a good historical romp, only of the very recent History kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual.	s
French scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from Norsk Hydro in Vemork to take back to France in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness.	s

This is not only a story about life in the hospital, however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are, or who they are going to be.	s
I feel and believe in the characters of this movie.	s
It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.	s
I also considered the cinematography to be outstanding, some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict.	s
Also, the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me, it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end.	s
The build-up to it, with the creaking sounds, quick flashes of a mysterious being, and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one's favor.	s
I can't say Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film overall, though each had a few chances to shine.	s
It appears, that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do.	s
It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke.	s
Also on the topic of the cast, the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from Amy Ryan and Marisa Tomei, whose looks just get better and better as the years go by.	s
Over at the front Tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a German machine gun nest.	s
Then we have a cheap classless tasteless Producer like Sharukh Khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like "Kaal" to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of Art, and they surround themselves with borderline talent, and they recoup the investment before the word gets around.	s
The film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film.	s
In a way, there are four different films occurring at the same time, a thread from each character.	s
The story is well-known, some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal)... And I don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut.	s
This is a movie which reveals today's society for the lowly male in all its horror.	s
However, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, don't miss this one.	s
If the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher.	s
Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in and of themselves.	s
He should make more drama which "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are good notion.	s
But this terrible cry - does that mean, that all will repeat again and again and again... that his soul is in a cage or something?	s
The jokes were great!	s
This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.	s
The character voices do save this film in its English version, but it would have been more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that its happening Paris, I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles.	s
Will she stick up for him?	s
So patience is required.	s
Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story.	s
Swinging around the city as Spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game.	s
Also, the corny ending of the original which I assume is in current VHS versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form.	s
This movie is one among the very few Indian movies, that would never fade away with the passage of time, nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish, even as the Indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the P.T.	s

Film starts out with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive.	s
The cinematography is good, though a little cheesy; the filmmakers use scenery, lighting, and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well.	s
Part feminist treaty and part American dream fulfilled the story chugs along nicely with fine performances by its ensemble including the comical Bauer and Taylor as siblings in smut and Harris having a field day as a fellow fotog with a taste for wine and chatter.	s
Many drooling shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold.	s
The original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying.	s
Rumour has it that around the time that ABBA  the multi-award winning Swedish disco favourites 's star had reached its zenith, the band grew disillusioned with singing in English and yearned to perform in their native tongue.	s

It was only a summer "story", and it became, from love to hate, almost to death, the most important time of their lives.	s
Throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie.	s
No Faux drama.	s
It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction.	s
For UK readers, DMAX (Sky channel 155) have just started (Jan 2008) daily re-runs of Airwolf.	s

It was released in France on dvd several years ago--I wish it would be re-released with English subtitles.	s
Not only did they go far and above with its presentation, they went that much further.	s
For all those who might say, in defense of Guys and Dolls yet, that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth, I need only remind them Cabaret, The Three-penny Opera, Carousel, A Star is Born, even The Sound of Music, which I don't care for as much (and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-Cabaret musicals), all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties.	s
And the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this!	s
Therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the DVD.	s
This is a study of life as a Broadway star.	s
My vote is nine.	s
I have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely.	s
And besides, any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me.	s
The ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the Bradys, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie.	s
The ending was shocking!	s
I can remember being freaked out by metal teens when I was a kid.	s
There is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence.	s
A very troubled production and studio meddling resulted in Christian Viel eventually abandoning the project.	s
Instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty, harrowing realism.	s
What a surprise to see him as such a hot-head--though in most other ways, he's the same old Scott you'd expect.	s
And, when they made movies from studio funding, one, it was LA that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two, they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own.	s
A lot of them were crappy even back then.	s
It has a great story, excellent performances, a lot of humour, fabulous music and, above everything else, real heart.	s
A thoroughly satisfying film, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent.	s
It was so real...so, so, real.	s
Although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author, the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.	s
After having seen this film for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day.	s
One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words (ie: you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words) I think the technical term is an "anagram" Anyway, they typed in "Rocket Boys" and sure enough what comes back is "October Sky".	s
Gentility and morality made sure of it.	s

In a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York.	s
The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them Barbara Bouchet and a young Sybil Danning.	s
It's called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for the love of God!	s
Why is that?	s
A complete tale.	s
Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through Shin-ae's life.	s
Curly is a scream dressed up in drag as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in top form as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively.	s

When the Carnival comes to Wilder's town, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see Vida, whom which Wallace has been in love with!	s
Its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating.	s
Rogers is vivacious, and a youthful Astaire is a dynamo.	s
This must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history.	s
What I do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience.	s
Very realistic, very captivating.	s
Unfortunately, it is Welles' obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety.	s
I am not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this track by Winger from the scene 'station' builds the bill and ted robots in the van.	s

There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar.	s

He could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother, but chose to rule as a bad king.	s
But the main event was a total mess, King Booker teamed with Finlay to take on John Cena and Batista.	s
Another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence.	s
All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that I can see) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination.	s
It is Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright.	s
Overall, an enjoyable Disney classic.	s
American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more.	s
The film opens greatly, and very shockingly for most hypocritic attitudes, showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the mare and continue the race, but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there, not the close-ups of organs as could be so easily claimed.	s
Thanks, BBC (PS...I would have paid more for a special edition DVD...with maybe some interviews with the stars...or a making of show)	s
Vertigo co-stars Stewart (in his last turn as a romantic lead) and Novak elevate this, Stewart's other "Christmas movie," movie to above mid-level entertainment.	s
Irving and Paula Klaw are richly drawn as the working-class stiffs they were (having met Paula at Movie Star News in 1990 I can say that Lili Taylor's performance is unimpeachable), and Jared Harris as John Willie (Coutts) is an adoringly debauched genius.	s
It had a lot of historical value, played out by very talented actress/actors, and it's not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable.	s
My friends thought the same.	s
Other reviewers have pointed out Staden's inadequacies as Modesty Blaise.	s
The producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years!	s
The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve.	s
Don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on!	s
Wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around.	s
And of course: "To be or not to be".	s
The majority is in black and white, but frequently, splashes and sequences of colour do emerge.	s
I really think this could well be a cult classic.	s
Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher?	s
Not being a rap-conscious guy (although I could identify Snoop Dogg, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer music), I wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film.	s
Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film "Bright Victory", also with local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville.	s
Suddenly workers and capital at the northern English mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoods.	s
With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goa'uld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high.	s
Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves.	s
Lulu, the only female of the lot, is on the contrary linked to the Israeli Left, although her political activities seem to be confined to raves against the occupation".	s
When we watched the film last night together with my husband, he said, what a great example of an Art film, and I so agree with him.	s
And there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub-plots, and the script is first class.	s
A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition.	s
You get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS),along with Russell, who would star in Lewtons' CAT PEOPLE movies..and Rosetto, from SPOOKS RUN WILD...a nice slice of Poverty Row talent.	s
The performances in this film were all very up to par and I really had no problem there.	s
But overall, it's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments.	s

In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924.	s
Too much good stuff!)	s
Tate Donovan is also great as the too-perfect girl's father, Carson Drew.	s
All of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made.	s
I am ready to watch it again.	s
Broinowski is not deterred however, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us.	s
Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you.	s
The malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted.	s
The zombies come in all varieties.	s
The episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill, a salesman who can recite the Gettysburg address, watching over a sick brother in law, ant hallucinations, and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around.	s
Gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die, machines will be destroyed and rebuilt, battles will be lost and won, and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical.	s
Hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one, and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale of 'noir'.	s
What more could you want?	s
As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable.	s
Why?	s
I think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television.	s
In a late night interview alone with the film crew, Chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather.	s
The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent.	s
Having tea one day Carey is entranced by a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago.	s
Give it a go, it's good to see an Independent British Movie more than holding it's own against the big established studios!!	s
This little war puts Harry on suspension which he doesn't care about but he goes away on a little vacation.	s
Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.	s
Watch him.	s
Bing has one of his patented upbeat philosophical numbers with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon.	s
Sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some significant roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard, and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this movie like he was in The Muppet Show's last season and The Great Muppet Caper, and Miss Piggys dog Foo Foo should have been with her as well (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Whitmire, had a big part in this movie, and he wasn't very well-known at the time).	s
Overall, this is a terrific little film, and much more fun to watch than you might imagine.	s
I repeat now: Most shorts I loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix.	s
They put Lex Luger over well, but made a wise choice in having Yokozuna keep the belt.	s
One thing I've noticed when looking at external reviews, is that when the film has been slated, the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film, as they haven't even mentioned the possibility of Heaton having sexual feelings for Spike.	s
The masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow.	s
Season 2 and Season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my Favorites such Freaky Friday, Secrets.	s
Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (of "Antonia"), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.	s
With gratitude and respect Mr. Berman and Mr. Braga.	s
I've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to Henry Fool, and even though it technically is, I think that Fay Grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film.	s
A security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat.	s
While not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?	s
And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone.	s
I remember so much about it...thats where I got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie!!	s
I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest.	s
This action-packed film involving a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent.	s
There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater.	s
This movie is not for all audiences, but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army...and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such.	s
We have a genuinely unique film commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we have forgotten about it.	s
Yet he's also cheerful, funny, nice, and even loving towards Adele.	s
What's key here is how much this story focuses upon character, with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time - although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static (read: "talky").	s
As for the film's principal Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon), he's shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with Carradine following the barroom brawl.	s
Maybe the only way to cope is excess, or maybe that's just my interpretation of it.	s
Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife (Kathleen Harrison) he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop.	s
I would probably have missed this film if I hadn't chosen Air Canada.	s
We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics.	s
He is constantly griping about the life problems around him: meat is too expensive (it's like $1.00 / lb.	s
It makes propositions that give pause - if you're available to see them - and then, of course, it goes on its insanely merry way.	s
Overall, excellent movie.	s
A coral comedy full of his own landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party!	s
If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes!	s
All the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic (incl.	s
might make you feel different.	s
Overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs, pop-culture, government intervention, the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia, all felt the wave of various drugs over the years, and the interplay between all was very evident.	s
Current fan favorite Toby Stephens doesn't even try.	s
The Japanese cyber-punk films have never really done a whole lot for me, but of the handful that I've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining.	s
There are so many good things to say about this “B” movie.	s
i think it is a nice movie; i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere; i think it was not intended to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a purpose); i think it is very natural; i think it is humane; i think it was interesting; i think the actors never made me think... waw lame acting (they are not Sean Connory & co) neither is the film a block buster, they are like the movie... normal ppl that can act...; i think the movie reached its intention; i think it made me feel things (or feel them again :) ); i think i'm not objective; i really enjoyed it... that i know.	s
I have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature.	s
Leslie and Joey fall in love, and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans, they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives.	s
Everything they did was so damn original.	s
In the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8MM, this is quite a ride.	s
Courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy,plotting and counter-plotting,naked ambition and sometimes,outright murder.	s
In the bastion of American safety and security, chaos can still strike.	s
It definitely wasn't perfect though.	s
Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show's chief writer and Celeste's alter-ego and confidant while Carrie Fisher has a modest part as the hard-as-nails producer of the show.	s
And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, although she's not in the film very much, so don't get too excited there.	s
And one day she finds it, without even looking for it, when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains.	s
The sequel is about Fay's journey, and as I said before, hers is one of finding the life-giving sanity in chaos, not the creative chaos in staid order.	s
Not being a Paul Reiser fan, we must confess that as Ben Kleinman, he is right.	s
Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.	s
This movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that I have ever seen.	s
It's not necessary to showpiece someone's sexuality to this extent - I hope they tone it down & let Aster & Zen be people not tokens - I don't treat my gay friends any differently, They're just regular guys.	s
The shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic.	s
But could this athletic musical comedy star raised in Australia ("X-Man's" Wolverine) really pass as an aristocrat?	s
Yes, I am strange.	s
You'll all keep coming back for this one!	s
And if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, just skip over the naughty scenes.	s
The courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt.	s
Director/co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending.	s
This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard.	s
Brooke Adams stars as Virginia.	s
Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantankerous Taoist who aids the young lovers.	s
This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it!	s
I just can't believe that these games can get so much better, but they do.	s
Oh yeah, Paulie really could (smart)talk and had a swift New Jersey accent.	s
You're either bright enough to get "it" or you're not.	s
They did it.	s
If you do not have this excellent series on disc, I believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection.	s
I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative.	s
performance is masterfully inarticulate (he is supposed to be a man of few words).	s
My one biggest criticism is I felt a little let down by the show - probably not through its own fault, as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season, it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got.	s
A must see for all the family and a great DVD for my collection.	s
For another, the core performances are all good.	s
Fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession, as darkness falls the Squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist, they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above Gallows HIll, they quicken their speed, but will they be in time to help or save Fanshawe from his destiny?	s
Maureen Stapleton plays his sickly mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss, and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend.	s
There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased, which is not totally untrue, but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social, political, and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving (for better or obvious worse) for enough of a fascinating view.	s
It's suffice to say that John Ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying.	s
And to make matters worse (or maybe better, depending upon perspective), in Dr.	s
I didn't cared much about Tom Cruise's acting prowess but I must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie...not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character....they merge and then speak and its beautiful.	s
Once exciting activities now seem mundane.	s
Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman, the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman, and the people who touched on their lives, in both a negative and a positive way.	s
For one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his MIA brother, St John).	s
The opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting Peres 'Prez' Prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited (but his grunts are unmistakable, and no-one else did them); and with familiar cast names, including Kathy Najimi a full year before she hit with Sister Acts 1 & 2 plus Teri Hatcher from TV's Superman.	s
This phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time, with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting.	s
Zombie Birds.	s
This film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy.	s
Kate Winslet's performance is also of great note.	s
The one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium.	s
Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in Lola but too yellow .	s
like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff.	s
ACTING is not bad: The Judge is as good as ever, and the others are.	s
The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R&B charts at the time.	s
In Part Two, Che enters Bolivia, and along with changing geographical location, the rules and the structure changes.	s
There's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gang's penchant for gay sex- at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want.	s
Stewart, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out.	s
We had also watched Animal House just before that so we saw two movies that starred an SNL alumna and had some naked breasts.	s
Good, but unexceptional.	s
What is infuriating is that it's not that difficult.	s
By the time one sees him in drag, it goes between cringe-worthy and true camp, particularly when he goes for the double-climax at the end (which, of course, is of little surprise).	s
and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone.	s
All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed.	s
She knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do.	s
As they'd say in espanol, "Es muy muy bien !!!	s
I don't think there's anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together.	s
Rayvyn	s
etc, but this is far more mature than his previous works.	s
Nice lady, huh?!	s
It wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better.	s
But as always happens in the movies, and sometimes even in life, some unexpected things begin to go wrong, and the tension rises appreciably, so that Fontaine begins to sweat.	s
It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways.	s
a flight where she meets Jack...an ordinary seeming guy, until he suavely reveals his profession and plans, which coincidentally include her in them, she is the key to the Keefe's (sp?)	s
But otherwise, the movie's just plain funny once it gets going.	s
Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of them all.	s
I'm not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me, especially because it's his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top.	s
I had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film, but this was great great acting.	s
It was first up against Police Woman on NBC.	s
A bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching.	s
The music is very typical space opera fair.	s
Luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings.	s
What a shame, and shame on th network for not giving this show a full seasons chance.	s
Karloff, austere and embittered in his Carpathian mountain retreat, is Janos Rukh, genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in Africa.	s
Six Degrees is a wonderful show!	s
The wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie.	s
Instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery, The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted.	s
Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage.	s
It is beautifully conceived, shot and edited.	s
In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other.	s
This is British comedy at its finest - dark, quirky and funny in ways that American films just never are.	s
Some real good tension in there.	s
Is all about feelings... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness...	s
For a Korean movie...	s
It's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand, and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie/radical movement of the late 60's.	s
Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while vacationing in Paris where he saw her perform in a ballet.	s
Reckon it don't get more controversial than that!	s
Large scale and touching, what more could a movie lover want!	s
Hal is the same at the beginning of the film.	s
Jeff Fahey (the Ray Liotta look alike) did a bang up job as the confused, often stammering, police officer that had an affair with Gina.	s
Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed."	s
OK, it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the British can produce.	s
This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.	s
But as this is a formula picture, not a Strindberg play, the possibility that Stanwyck might want want to have a fling,--leaving aside the question of her husband's predicament,--remains unexplored.	s
See it.	s
Angle looked like he was about to tap, but Taker kicked The Rock out of the submission hold.	s
I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis.	s
But of course, what I'd definitely like to see is the show come back on the air.	s
But these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well.	s
Release this show in America!	s
I would've given this movie five stars, but the music playing killed it for me.	s
If you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in "The Matrix" or a drama such as "Of Mice and Men" then this movie isn't for you.	s
New "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director Wes Craven ("Scream" movies and "A Nightmare on Elm Street").	s
The movie brings out that sense of "family", not only amongst the characters, but amongst the actors, as well.	s
An edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it.	s
It's odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock.	s
No one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate.	s
Morris signs with the Devil Rays, begins at the AA level and moves up quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball.	s
It is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience, hopefully driving them to change.	s
Heartland was in production about the same time as Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate - Heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film.	s
Score: 10 out of 10.	s
Charles Durning is the chief of police.	s
It can't turn invisible, but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie.	s
The Asian godfather this is not, but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence.	s
I also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned.You may ask yourself was A.C. Doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question.	s
In keeping with Miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script, this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with.	s
The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "Bruck-buster" action at its best.	s
movie, but it was on Elvis.	s
I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin).	s
It leaves a lasting impression in the end.	s
Frank Sinatra, on the other hand, was flat, even his vocal performances.	s
Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion.	s
You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one.	s
We all like Steve Carell, this isn't what fans of The Office would expect to see from him, but you know what, I liked this movie.	s
Modern audiences, for the most part, do not understand silent films Acting was different then, with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions.	s
Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always, and even new cast members, the classic comedic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson), did a great job also.	s
That said, I definitely recommend Coonskin to fans of Bakshi and of every form of animation.	s
Busy Philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and I hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her!	s
It certainly isn't the best comedy ever, but I liked it a lot more than "A Dirty Shame".	s
If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, check this one out.	s
I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch.	s
Well, the house is haunted.	s
It's also a movie about unendurable pain, and how different people endure it.	s
There's also a needless, and way too long, dream sequence at the end, in which they had the audacity to shoot someone's foot for what seemed minutes at a time.	s
It's 1922 and the hight of the Black & Tan Irish revolt against the mighty British Empire with the Tans, British occupying troops, on the lookout for wanted Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford, wanted for the killing of a Briish soldier.	s
Kidding...	s
No crazy suspense.	s
My very favorite character in films, but in nearly all of them the character of Zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain`s can`t tell who is under that cloth then they are daft.	s
Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report, until William's character gets close to achieving his goal.	s
Emil Jannings is, predictably, a marvelous Russian general, distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex-general, transfixed in his misery, and the vigorous, hearty officer of yore.	s

Vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted Mummy guy.	s
His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro).	s

There might not be too much to Tierney's role, but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role, knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile, gentle manner, and twinkle in her eye.	s
On balance, one must hand the bays to Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star, a role which he largely creates, and to the director for his clever closing homage to Busby Berkeley's filmic spectacles.	s
His distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compelling.	s

It is, at best, a statement of recognizable fact.	s

Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.	s
As far as John Ford's films are concerned, we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical Lincoln's figure in several of director's works, such as 1924 The Iron Horse or 1936 The Prisoner of the Shark Island, the second one, just as Young Mr. Lincoln, utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite Lincoln's song - Dixie.	s
The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes.	s
In the world of Shakespeare acting, the two brightest luminaries remain Olivier and Branagh, and while Olivier is the superior actor, Branagh brings Shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice, and transforms it into churlish, easy-going, populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity.	s
He went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and, assured it was safe, narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent.	s
Matthau is great in the beginning, charming us with his teddy-bear demeanor around the poker table, but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrance's in "The Shining," reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame.	s

I give it a 6.5/10.	s

Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing.	s
I saw the The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow!	s
Well I can't let you get away with that.	s
When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies.	s
Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence, you really can discern that it's Vivien Leigh in the long shots.	s
Benkei is a great brooding anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune)is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power, and Tetsukichi the scavenging sword-smith makes for and interesting depiction of the "common man" and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters.	s
The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City.	s
Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone.	s

Made on a very modest, tight budget...Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of "sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a knife/axe/chainsaw/ wielding psycho".	s
I liked it!	s
The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played Tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job.	s
Their creative views of life and writing.	s
Going into this movie, I had heard good things about it.	s

But the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be - or seem to be - a little awry.	s

On top of this, I was given several alternate options, in case I found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production.	s
Title (Brazil): "Labirinto" ("Labyrinth")	s
The story tends to be a bit week though, but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action.	s
Then it becomes a roller coaster ride with WILD Matrix-like action fight-scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon.	s
Although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built (or bought) to your specifications, it is not the first, nor the last.	s
He covers his true profession by doing mail order work; by all appearances, he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family.	s
Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers, Drew and Bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip.	s
However, Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley film until I realized that it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because Henry Fool's confessions were bad... not just raunchy or dirty, but inescapably broken.	s
Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team.	s
Most importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold.	s
The costumes that Kriemhild wears are also very impressive, and her acting is based on her face and look.	s
Three funny words.	s
One of the most appealing elements of a Gilliam film is that the well-concocted visuals, the unsettling backdrops, and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement.	s
This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made.	s
An intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the Santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of Temuco.	s
He even LOOKS like Ed Wood, and as played by Zane this character is at various timesfunny, sleazy, tragic, sympathetic, and anonymous(sometimes simultaneously!!!).	s
Even my A.D.D couldn't keep up.	s
As some performances were done in English (the scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I heartily recommend, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from French to English and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on Paramount DVD.	s
Its very corny at times.	s
First love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous.	s
The movie is absolutely silly.	s
In short: "Castle of Blood" is one of the most atmospheric and greatest Gothic Horror films ever made, and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre!	s
Presque Rien, what want to show us, is how cruel can be the life, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life.	s
For a film so full of emotion (and be warned it's like opening champagne, you'll never get the lid back on) the ending is a cold contradiction.	s
This woman spends so much time trying to be happy despite life's numerous disappointments and as she sits in a city made for lovers, she realizes that she is in fact happy and loves herself more than she knew.	s
Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile.	s
The flashback scenes are what really made it for me.	s
Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience.	s
The dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don't capture.	s
Why?	s
The other corpse to be here is Ted DeCorsia, a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself.	s
This movie trys to portray that but there is so much of Joseph's life that can't be covered in a mere 2 hour movie.	s
If you have a sweet little girl or soft-hearted little boy you really want to please, buy this movie and treat your small children.	s
I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there...	s
If you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you.	s
I was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie.	s
The Germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb.	s
All the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling.	s
The film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you have ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know it's going to end with a bang and this flick doesn't disappoint.	s
Adolescent summer - even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is/was the same for us all.	s
But that is misleading beyond belief.	s
Guaranteed!	s
Brent, the new President of the Bank his grandfather founded, eventually marries her - and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds).	s
Bob Saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls.	s
I would like to see much more of this show.	s
It's obvious that I love this movie.	s
Taught by her father, Artemisia was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side art created by men.	s
The movie was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well.	s
I started watching the show from the first season, and at the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it.	s
Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies.	s
I have never seen it again on TV and would like to.	s
THE FLOCK is a prime example.	s
I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match Mazinger Z, as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern.	s
To me this is the definitive version of Dickens' timeless story; it's the one I always remember watching in school, and I remember being absolutely terrified by it!	s
Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western comes across as the Real McCoy, engrossing, entertaining, spectacular; in no way outdated.	s
I have, "Things to Come," on D.V.D.	s
I think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short.	s
These are all questions Norman will ponder his entire life.	s
Dalton's 'Mr.	s
I am not too keen in romantic movies these days, because i see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable.	s
The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger, rather than comedy, unless you are watching the great scenes described above.	s
The movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly, and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time, that the seriousness of "Rosie!	s

For someone so wild and outrageous (and he IS wild and outrageous) his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols (The Stones, Velvets etc.)	s
You could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties.	s
It tells a tail that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is.	s
The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.	s
These movies are dark, serious, extremely well made, and don't care about happy endings.	s
The screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting.	s
Outstanding performances, delightful magic, funny and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous!	s
Together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today's technology-driven cinema, where rapid-fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it.	s
As she floats down from the sky, Pazu, an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines, sees Sheeta and catches her.	s
I absolutely loved this film!	s
The question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are: Do you think the government would be capable of doing this?	s
Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, but it works for me.	s
Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son.	s
too often.	s
Such is typical of the insatiable, hedonistic personality.	s

It is a simple story of how close co-workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances.	s
Each family has a gay son.	s
You could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film, especially Adam West.	s
Nope.	s
It can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people.	s
Kill for the love of Kali!	s
I was 'enchanted', i should say, and surprised because of how uniquely it was done.	s
Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is an auto mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, which gets higher with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris.	s
When I watch it I wish that I could be 10-14 again.	s
This is not a film to be taken literally but rather symbolically, showing that Lincoln was indeed warming up for the events in his life that were to creates his legacy.	s
He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian.	s
For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action, especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors.	s
Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash, gang rape, or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered.	s
I am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many, many films.	s
I personally found this movie extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious!	s

He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing except death is going to stop him.	s
the next morning when she awakens she is still on the stairs, never having reached the top.	s
Many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list.	s
The director also directed "Hoosiers," which was somehow both formulaic and exciting.	s
It is a tale of survival of women in feudal Japan.	s
Another one for the Babes & Bullets crowd.	s
Sean's character, not Billy's, is the hunted, and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played.	s
In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?	s
Halfway through Karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind.	s
Throughout the movie, you are trying to find out who the identity of Batwoman is, unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website (so if you haven't seen it already don't go there).	s
Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale.	s
Maude Eburne provides the film's humor as a very naive(..and easily influenced)patient of von Niemann's who believes she has ailments she reads about in books near the laboratory where he works.	s
Is it surprising that Grant should take an immediate interest in Holly, considering the manner of their initial meeting, Holly's dazzling smiles and her lively self-possession?	s
Most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did.	s
Clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style.	s
This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I've seen it (I even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me.	s
We males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body, but try winning one over while you're an dumpy, old white guy!	s
The plot is fun, A group of kids, embark on a journey they never expected, when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot.	s
at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up...it made me jump!	s
Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant ("Say goodnight to the bad guy").	s
An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men.	s
P.S.	s
The group Pervert.	s
Joan Allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job, but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how Brian Cox's character, from the first two films, took matters into his own hands.	s
At first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all, but gradually Early Grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer... Not only is the story very impressive, so is the acting from our four leads.	s
While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives, she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark.	s
Disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world.	s
It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else.	s

If you're lucky and you haven't seen the watered-down US release, see if you can get the original UK version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take.	s
Her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film, "Of Human Bondage," in which she stars with Leslie Howard as Philip Carey.	s
He introduced himself to America through this movie and he was great.	s
He is actually female character's age.	s
My grade 10 out of 10	s
Combined with the cracker-jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events).	s
There are fine performances all around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman's being the best of the cast-no surprise there.	s
Worth recommending.	s
She seems to exist in a state of deja vu.	s
They are sisters.	s
Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street", must have been the king of the Depression Era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema, for he filled this picture with it.	s
I also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or act out scenes from Star Wars (not called by those names in the show, of course).	s
But this is a caper, remember?	s
The cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel, and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact.	s
Although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious, I can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find Tarzan and Jane and were never heard from again.	s
Tuileries: The Coen Brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs.	s
But in this case it makes some sense, because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never love it, because you lose it.	s
Fortunately the eight year old daughter Ruth escapes capture.	s
This film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters.	s
I would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the Academy Awards.	s
I'm saying no more (my "spoiler" declaration above only covers THIS movie).	s
The story's frankly quite simple, and at times this movie would have looked like the many Japanese movies which children-miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust, and how they go about hanging around each other, dealing with respective adversaries and the likes.	s
The movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy--the players were hysterical--I'll bet they had a good old time while making it.	s
This is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize Flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well.	s
The characters never take off their underclothes in bed!	s
Quite a contrast from his "Public Enemy" 2 years earlier.	s
It also stars Lisa Rinna!	s
This movie is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writing.	s
That aside, this film ranks as a classic.	s
The 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to British film goers doing the war.	s
There's Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar, dancing on a table, Cagney fighting.	s
I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and loved it.	s
A lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80's music.	s
With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies, "I'll See You There" is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion.	s
The whole World, except for their house went away.	s
The people Tagge represents are never revealed.	s
That's why you shouldn't put too much faith in Oscars.	s
I would have her babies.	s
These two should have had a lot more time on screen together.	s
on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band.	s
years went by and i forgot the title of the film, and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again.	s
Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed?	s
Yes, I do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate.	s
I had never heard of this flick despite the connection to George Clooney (whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit) and his Ocean's 11 director Steven Soderbergh.	s
The world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike.	s

Kasdan underscores this theme lightly, rather than insisting on it, and bolsters it in various ways, most memorably by the device, right in the center of the film, of having Mac and his wife, lying in bed, each dreaming their own dreams, but as well showing, later on in the film, how those dreams have the power, within the film, to shape reality.	s
Though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement.	s

This is the film that "blue noses" wouldn't let alone and led to the pivotal "prurient interest with no social redeeming value" standard that, thankfully, still stands.	s
The central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you, and there's a ritual that goes with that.	s
Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed.	s
It really is a fun little film, with a bunch of faces you didn't know were in it.	s
Streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo.	s

It is a different beast altogether (forgive the pun).	s
There are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about $1 million, the directors Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (who are screenwriters by trade, having written crazy/beautiful and the upcoming Tuxedo starring Jackie Chan) have achieved a film that is great, funny and endearing.	s

But I can't believe that is Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup.	s
I gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film, but I would have voted higher if wasn't for the feeling that something (although I can't pinpoint what) was off and if it hadn't have been, the movie would have gone to an even higher level.	s

Way to go, FX.	s
Something big is happening here obviously.	s
It's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal.	s

They were functional, but nothing stood out.	s
Here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones, lending a bleakness as oppressive as Douglas Sirk's bourgeois melodramas of the '50s.	s
You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face.	s
Zoe of course tags along... What can I say other then why is this film hiding under a rock?	s
Probably the most whimsical installment of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short, but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode.	s

And it's not just him.	s
Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is mean, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix appropriately pathetic, and Seymour outrageously wonderful.	s
Tarzan and his mate(1934) however, falters.	s
So here is my advice coming from someone who's done a couple productions of Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to watch an entertaining take on the play, watch the '63 film.	s
Sadly, he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear (they are hinted at as well).	s

A TV series follow up would broaden the new characters and give us a chance to occaisionally see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray, and Georgette!	s
I give it a ***1/2 out *****.	s
But the series had fallen into a FPS rut.	s
